[SENT] Lol all the 🤡 saying [IN] was only going to lose 1 game after [OTHER] game . 	['this team ', 'the Titans ']	[(29, 38), (75, 85)]	['[IN]', '[OTHER]']	The comment expresses disbelief towards earlier opinions that the in-group team would only lose one game after facing the Titans. Since the commenter supports the Rams, 'this team' refers to the Rams, thereby warranting the [IN] tag. Additionally, the Titans are neither the Rams (in-group) nor the 49ers (out-group), which means 'the Titans' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The win probability implies the Rams are not doing well at the moment, but the focus here is on prior predictions, not the current match state.	The commenter is sarcastically referencing those who thought the in-group team (Rams) would only lose one game after a previous game against the Titans. This implies a criticism of the in-group team's performance. 'this team' refers to the in-group (Rams) and should be tagged [IN]. 'the Titans' refers to another team in the NFL, not the in-group or the out-group, so it should be tagged [OTHER].	1637026941.0	rams	49ers	Dodger_Dawg	Deacon Jones	0.0	0.25575140118598905	[5, 5]

The tone suggests frustration with those giving up on the team too early, which is something a supporter of the in-group would do. Despite not mentioning the team explicitly, the context is clear that the comment is defending the in-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as it implicitly refers to the in-group team.	The commenter appears to be addressing those who are prematurely giving up on the season, which suggests frustration with fans of the in-group team (Bengals) who lack confidence. This sentiment is generally directed towards an in-group audience. Since there's no explicit reference to the in-group within the sentence itself, the entire sentence should be tagged '[IN]' to reflect that it is implicitly about the in-group, encapsulating the overall tone and context. Thus, the sentence tagged as '[IN]' with no explicit referring expressions works correctly for this scenario.	1662918887.0	bengals	steelers	StarchyAndDelicious	:3	12.0	0.401012301445007	[5]

The commenter is praising McKinnon by calling him a "receiving TD machine," which is a positive sentiment and aligns with the high win probability, indicating the in-group is performing well. 'McKinnon' should be tagged [IN] as he is a member of the in-group team.	The commenter is jovially praising McKinnon for being a 'receiving TD machine.' Since McKinnon is a player for the Chiefs, which is the in-group team the commenter supports, 'McKinnon' should be tagged with [IN].	1672605270.0	chiefs	broncos	Biggest_Cans	Alex Smith	11.0	0.941939395340675	[5]

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The high win probability (94.5%) suggests that the in-group, the Packers, are performing well in this game. The use of "cheat code" is typically a compliment, indicating a remarkable or skillful play, and since the in-group is likely doing well, it's reasonable to assume the comment is positively referring to the in-group's performance. There are no explicit references to either team, but given the positive context and high win probability, the comment is implicitly praising the Packers. Thus, the entire sentence is tagged as [IN] because it's implicitly about the in-group team.	The commenter likely refers to their own team's exceptional or impressive performance for the touchdown (TD). Since the comment positively describes the action, it is more indicative of the in-group, as fans typically praise their own team. The sentence does not contain any explicit mentions of the teams or players, but the context implies a positive remark about the in-group's performance. Thus, the entire sentence should be tagged with [IN].	1665325786.0	packers	giants	themosey		1.0	0.945033057087402	[3]

Given the win probability is close to 50%, it is in a critical part of the game, and the commenter is likely venting about the in-group (Patriots) underperforming. Therefore, "This team" should be tagged with [IN], as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The phrase 'This team' is used without specifying which team, indicating that it is likely the in-group team that the commenter supports, which is the Patriots in this case. Fans typically criticize their own team when discussing faults like 'implodes in the red zone'. Therefore, 'This team' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group (Patriots).	1668972254.0	patriots	jets	Aye_Lexxx		5.0	0.485156834125519	[5]

['Dissly', 'Cards']	[(7, 13), (33, 38)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	Dissly is a player for the Seahawks, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Thus, 'Dissly' should be tagged [IN]. 'Cards' in this context is a common shorthand for the Cardinals, the opponent team, so it should be tagged [OUT]. The win probability is slightly in favor of the Seahawks, but the comment's focus is on an interaction between an in-group player and an out-group cheerleader, making the tags for 'Dissly' and 'Cards' appropriate.	Dissly is a player for the Seahawks, which is the in-group team for the commenter, so 'Dissly' should be tagged [IN]. The word 'Cards' is a short form for the Cardinals, which is the out-group team, and should therefore be tagged [OUT].	1667776189.0	seahawks	cardinals	EWVGL	​	7.0	0.522823810577393	[5, 5]

The high win probability suggests that the Chiefs are likely doing well, and the comment 'mad now' can indicate that Pacheco, as part of the in-group, is showing intensity or frustration, which is noteworthy to the commenter. Therefore, "Pacheco" is correctly tagged as [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team.	'Pacheco' is a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, which is the in-group team for the commenter. Since the comment is talking about Pacheco showing a strong emotion, it is more indicative of the commenter being deeply engaged or supportive, reinforcing the in-group association. Therefore, 'Pacheco' should be tagged with [IN].	1668363911.0	chiefs	jaguars	teedoe		1.0	0.781623423099518	[5]

Considering the win probability is very high for the Cowboys, the commenter's team, it makes sense that they might be making a derogatory comment about the opposing team, the Eagles. Therefore, 'their' should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to the out-group opponent team.	The phrase 'wash the hay outta their teeth' is a derogatory comment, implying that 'their' refers to a group that the commenter is disparaging. Given that the in-group is Cowboys and the out-group is Eagles, it is most likely that 'their' is referring to the out-group Eagles, as fans typically use derogatory comments for the opposing team. Therefore, 'their' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the out-group.	1641699544.0	cowboys	eagles	Federal-Negotiation9		2.0	0.9493477940559387	[5]

[SENT] [OUT] is able to spin , sure , but at this point it 's a joke 	['We', 'Ekeler']	[(7, 9), (55, 61)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	The commenter is frustrated with the in-group's poor defensive performance, as suggested by the high win probability which implies the Chiefs are likely winning but the commenter is still critical of their team. 'We' is used to describe the in-group's defense failures, which is a typical way for fans to refer to their own team in a critical manner. 'Ekeler' is a player for the Chargers, who is making impressive moves against the in-group, hence he's tagged as [OUT]. The comment is mainly about the in-group's inability to tackle well, while recognizing the opposing player's skill. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged as [IN] for in-group, and 'Ekeler' should be tagged as [OUT] for out-group.	The commenter uses 'We' to describe a failure in tackling, which indicates frustration with the in-group team's performance; thus, 'We' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the Chiefs, the team the commenter supports. In the second sentence, 'Ekeler' is a player for the Chargers, the out-group opponent, and the name Ekeler is used without a negative or positive relationship qualifier, which typically suggests he is on the opposing team. Therefore, 'Ekeler' should be tagged as [OUT].	1663297501.0	chiefs	chargers	shanesol	Pat "Kermit" Mahomes	3.0	0.951649155467749	[5, 5]

['The Jets', 'Jetsiest']	[(7, 15), (31, 39)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment is clearly focused on the in-group, which is the Jets in this case. The phrase "The Jets really are the Jetsiest" is a self-deprecating remark that implies the Jets are performing in a way that is stereotypically bad for the team. Despite the comment's negative tone, it is common for fans to use such language out of frustration, especially given the extremely low win probability of 0.1%. "The Jets" and "Jetsiest" should both be tagged [IN] since they refer directly to the in-group team.	The phrase "The Jets" refers directly to the in-group team the commenter supports, i.e., the Jets. The term "Jetsiest" is a colloquial or informal derivative referring to the characteristics or performance typically associated with the Jets, which again ties directly back to the in-group team. Thus, both "The Jets" and "Jetsiest" should be tagged as [IN], since they refer to the in-group team.	1662925790.0	jets	ravens	trendygamer		5.0	0.0006166696548461	[5, 5]

'Ruggs' and 'Ferell' are players for the Raiders, so they should be tagged [IN]. The comment mentions 'Lamb' and 'Juedy' who are players from other NFL teams, thus they should be tagged [OTHER]. Therefore, 'Ruggs' and 'Ferell' are tagged [IN], and 'Lamb' and 'Juedy' are tagged [OTHER] since it accurately reflects their affiliations with respect to the in-group Raiders. The commentary is critical of the Raiders' draft picks, hence Ruggs and Ferell are discussed in a negative light, typical of a fan's disappointment in underperforming in-group players.	The comment is referring to players associated with the Raiders and two other players, plus specific picks disrupting the franchise. 'Ruggs' and 'Ferell' are both players for the Raiders, so these references should be tagged as [IN]. 'Lamb' (referring to CeeDee Lamb of the Cowboys) and 'Juedy' (referring to Jerry Jeudy of the Broncos) are players from teams other than the Raiders and Ravens, so those names are tagged as [OTHER]. The critique is about the Raiders' choices and their potential busts, reinforcing the [IN] tags for Ruggs and Ferell in both sentences.	1631586932.0	raiders	ravens	doodoojones		7.0	0.151489675045013	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

['run D.', 'we']	[(19, 25), (45, 47)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	The comment seems to express frustration about not utilizing the run game effectively against a poor run defense. Given that it mentions a "31st ranked run D", which implies a very low ranking, it is likely to be referring to the opponent's (out-group) defense being weak. 'run D.' should thus be tagged as [OUT]. The second sentence then criticizes the in-group team for not exploiting this weakness in the opponent's defense, using the pronoun "we" to refer to the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, "we" is tagged as [IN]. The low win probability further supports that the commenter is likely to be thinking critically about their own team's strategies in an attempt to find ways to turn the game around.	The commenter mentions the "31st ranked run D," which refers to the out-group Chargers' weak run defense. Thus, "run D." should be tagged as [OUT]. The second sentence questions why the in-group Giants are not utilizing their run game against this weak defense, implying frustration with their own team's strategy. The use of "we" confirms that they are referring to their own team, so "we" should be tagged as [IN].	1639347134.0	giants	chargers	ralz9		4.0	0.07271724939346302	[5, 5]

['He', 'He', 'Miller']	[(22, 24), (60, 62), (86, 92)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment refers to a situation likely involving the in-group team's player being injured (indicated by "Ankle") and then walking around in pads, suggesting he might re-enter the game. Despite the relatively high win probability for the Bills, the commenter is focused on individual player performance. The first "He" in the second sentence refers to an in-group player who is walking around in pads, indicating he might play again, showing concern for his availability. The second "He" in the third sentence is being compared positively to Miller, a notable player for the in-group team (Von Miller), thus both "He" and "Miller" should be tagged as in-group.	The comment is discussing a player with an ankle injury, who is now walking around in pads. The second and third sentences suggest a comparison between this player and another player named Miller. Since the in-group team is the Bills, and Miller is a well-known player for the Bills (Von Miller), it is reasonable to assume that the player being referred to with the pronouns 'He' is also on the Bills.Thus, 'He' in both the second and third sentences should be tagged [IN] because the commenter is discussing a player from the in-group, comparing him to another in-group player, Miller. Miller should also be tagged [IN] as he is part of the in-group.The first sentence merely states 'Ankle', which provides context but does not reference any specific entity. The second and third sentences are about in-group players, where 'He' and 'Miller' specifically refer to entities from the in-group team, the Bills.	1662689683.0	bills	rams	squatheavyeatbig	:17-shorts:	2.0	0.766803562641144	[5, 5, 4]

Fans typically mention their own players when lamenting errors or criticizing game performance. Given the relatively high win probability for the Packers, the comment might be addressing a specific issue despite the team's overall favorable position. Therefore, 'Doubs' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	The commenter is likely referring to Romeo Doubs, a player for the Packers. Since the comment concerns the performance and situation of Doubs after a fumble, it pertains to an in-group player. Therefore, 'Doubs' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1664747720.0	packers	patriots	njh300		9.0	0.688454687595367	[5]

[SENT] Hand it to [IN] smh 	['Perine']	[(36, 42)]	['[IN]']	The commenter appears to be expressing frustration about a recent play that resulted in a gain of only 2 yards, which would suggest it was unsuccessful or insufficient in their view. The in-group team is the Bengals, evidenced by the low win probability indicating they are likely trailing. "Hand it to Perine" suggests a decision or critique regarding play strategy. Samaje Perine is a running back for the Bengals, the commenter's in-group team. Given the context, they are suggesting giving the ball to Perine as a better option, thereby indicating that the player's name belongs to the in-group. Hence, the term "Perine" should be tagged as [IN] because he is a player on the in-group team, the Bengals. The expression of frustration (smh, shorthand for "shaking my head") also suggests the commenter's concern is about their own team's performance.	The comment is lamenting a short gain of 2 yards and suggesting that the ball should be handed to Perine. Given that Perine is a player for the in-group team (Bengals), it makes sense to tag 'Perine' with [IN]. The frustration and critique imply familiarity and investment, indicative of a fan of the in-group team. Thus '[IN]' correctly tags 'Perine' as it refers to an in-group entity, and the tag '[IN]' for the whole sentence is appropriate as it implicitly refers to the strategy of the in-group team.	1675039677.0	bengals	chiefs	karmagod13000		3.0	0.181003779172897	[5]

The comment is mocking Tua, indicating it is about the out-group team (the Dolphins in this case). Given the context, the in-group (Ravens) is likely doing well (indicated by the high win probability), so the commenter is ridiculing the opponent's quarterback. Therefore, 'TUA' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to a player from the out-group team.	The commenter is mocking Tua Tagovailoa, a player for the Miami Dolphins, which is the out-group team in this context. Fans typically criticize or make fun of players from the opposing team rather than their own.

['they']	[(18, 22)]	['[OTHER]']	The comment "um ... did they get the number wrong on that facemask?" is likely referring to a mistake made by the officiating crew, not by either of the teams in the game. NFL fans often refer to the officials or referees as "they" when questioning a call. Given that the officials are not part of either the in-group (Bills) or the out-group (Browns) team, "they" should be tagged as [OTHER]. This reflects the common practice of referring to referees or other non-team entities as the "other" group in sports commentary.	The use of 'they' is ambiguous among fans watching a game, especially for a specific call, unless the context provides clarity. Here, 'they' likely refers to the referees or officials who make the call, which are neither part of the in-group nor the out-group. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged as [OTHER] since it refers to an entity independent of both teams.	1668974391.0	bills	browns	demential	Bills	6.0	0.803245782852173	[5]
train	zggz2m	izh4xp2	t3_zggz2m	[SENT] Sounds about raider 	[SENT] Sounds about [IN] 	['raider']	[(20, 26)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is using the phrase "Sounds about raider" to describe behavior or events associated with the Raiders, the in-group team they support. The win probability is high, indicating that the Raiders are likely doing well overall, but the comment implies that whatever happened is typical behavior in the context of the Raiders' performance. Hence, the word 'raider' should be tagged as [IN] to denote it refers to the in-group.	The word 'raider' clearly refers to the in-group team, Raiders, even though it is not capitalized or pluralized. The comment is expressing a sentiment or stereotype associated with the Raiders, indicating familiarity and support. Thus, 'raider' should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1670550536.0	raiders	rams	Cavemattt		1.0	0.862649410963058	[5]

This comment focuses on specific elements and players within the Jets. In the first sentence, "Zach Wilson" is a player for the Jets, thus it should be tagged [IN]. The rest of the sentence discusses his potential on a better team, implying that the current team isn't optimal. In the second sentence, "He" refers to Zach Wilson again and should be tagged [IN].In the third sentence, "we" refers to the Jets organization, discussing hopes for future improvements within the team, so "we" should be [IN].The fourth sentence criticizes "The o line," which is part of the Jets team, thus "The o line" should be tagged [IN]. Overall, each referenced entity (Zach Wilson, He, we, The o line) clearly pertains to the in-group (Jets), which is why they are tagged as [IN].	Zach Wilson is the quarterback for the Jets, which makes him part of the in-group, so 'Zach Wilson' in the first sentence should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence continues talking about him, so 'He' is also tagged [IN]. The commenter uses 'we' in the third sentence, indicating that they are referring to their own team, the Jets, so 'we' should be tagged [IN]. In the fourth sentence, 'The o line' (offensive line) is criticized, which also refers to a part of the in-group team, thus it should be tagged [IN]. The consistent references to improving the team around Zach Wilson and criticizing its current state further confirm that these entities are part of the in-group team.	1631477994.0	jets	panthers	rubehefner		7.0	1.0	[5, 5, 5, 5]

['[SENT]', 'we']	[(0, 6), (54, 56)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment expresses a strong positive sentiment about absolute domination, which implies that the commenter is in a joyous state, and likely refers to the in-group Eagles given the extremely high win probability (99.9%). The phrase 'we' is almost always referring to the in-group team the commenter supports, so it is tagged [IN] in the second sentence. The first sentence implicitly refers to the in-group's performance without mentioning specific words or phrases that denote the Eagles, so it is tagged [SENT] and labeled as [IN].	The comment exudes confidence and pride, suggesting a strong performance by the in-group team. The phrase "Absolute and utter domination" indicates that the commenter is praising the in-group's performance without explicitly mentioning them, thus the first sentence should be tagged as [IN]. Furthermore, in the second sentence, "we" directly refers to the in-group, showing that the commenter believes their team, the Eagles, should now be considered the favorites in the upcoming game. Therefore, both '[SENT]' in the first sentence and 'we' in the second sentence are tagged as [IN], referring to the in-group.	1674355304.0	eagles	giants	32BitWhore		5.0	0.999382495880127	[5, 5]

Najee Harris is a well-known player on the Steelers, so it makes sense to categorize his reference as [IN]. The win probability is relatively low, and the commenter is feeling sorry for their own player, reflecting their concern for the in-group despite the current challenging circumstances. Therefore, 'najee' should be tagged with [IN] as he is part of the Steelers, the in-group team.	The commenter expressing sympathy for 'najee' suggests they are a fan of the in-group, as fans typically empathize with their own team's players. Najee Harris, a known player for the Steelers, would therefore be tagged with [IN]. The sentiment expressed is directly related to a player from the in-group team. Hence, 'najee' should be tagged with [IN].	1632678889.0	steelers	bengals	kindoflikespam	:sc::c9::c0::sc: TJ Watt	8.0	0.315463542938232	[5]

Despite the relatively high win probability, this kind of emotional reaction is typical for fans who are invested in the game's outcome and fearful of a sudden turn of events. Since there are no explicit mentions of the in-group or out-group, the sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to signify that the distress is related to the in-group team.	The comment shows a strong emotional reaction, usually indicative of a fan's response to something unfavorable happening to their team. Since it is unlikely for fans to plead on behalf of the out-group, the expression "[SENT]" tagged [IN] indicates that the commenter is worried about the in-group team (Ravens) experiencing a negative outcome.	1666924701.0	ravens	buccaneers	bpopo329		8.0	0.700394332408905	[5]

['lions', 'zimmer']	[(22, 27), (35, 41)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]']	The 'lions' are another NFL team and not the opponent in this game, so they should be tagged as [OTHER]. 'zimmer' refers to Mike Zimmer, who was the head coach of the Vikings up until 2021. Given that the in-group is the Vikings, 'zimmer' should be tagged with [IN] because the commenter's focus is on the actions and focus of the in-group's head coach. Therefore, 'lions' is tagged [OTHER] and 'zimmer' is tagged [IN].	The 'lions' refer to the Detroit Lions, which are neither the Vikings nor the Packers, thus they should be tagged [OTHER]. 'zimmer' refers to Mike Zimmer, who is the head coach of the Vikings, the in-group team, and thus should be tagged with [IN]. The commenter is suggesting that, after losing to a team outside of the current game, the in-group team's coach has been focusing on self-preservation rather than winning, which aligns with how a fan would criticize their own team's coach.	1641178649.0	vikings	packers	rkp9741		4.0	0.012777093797922023	[5, 5]

Given that the in-group is the Chiefs, the term 'Offense' would refer to the Chiefs' offense. The win probability is slightly in favor of the in-group, but the immediate frustration is likely focused on a specific moment or continuous issue rather than the overall game. Therefore, 'Offense' should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The word 'Offense' likely refers to the in-group team (Chiefs), as the comment is expressing frustration, which is a typical reaction from a supporter towards their own team's performance. Fans usually don't get frustrated by the opposing team's offense; they would more likely express frustration if the opposing team was performing well. Therefore, 'Offense' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	1639710298.0	chiefs	chargers	jmdybf		3.0	0.552899181842804	[5]

The pronoun 'we' typically denotes the in-group, suggesting that the commenter is a fan of the Steelers. The phrase 'the Jets' refers to the out-group, as it is the team they are playing against and complaining about losing to. Consequently, 'the Jets' is tagged with [OUT], while '[SENT]' does not need further tagging as no other explicit referring expressions are present in the sentence.	The commenter is expressing their dissatisfaction with their team (Steelers) losing a game. The use of 'we' here implies that the commenter is a fan of the in-group team (Steelers). The phrase 'the Jets' specifically refers to the out-group team. Therefore, 'the Jets' should be tagged with [OUT] as it denotes the opponent team in this context. There are no explicit references to the in-group in this sentence apart from the implicit 'we', thus 'the Jets' is the only tagged entity with [OUT].	1664741425.0	steelers	jets	producermaddy	Juju	3.0	0.0965049106358159	[5]

The win probability is relatively low, suggesting that the Bills (in-group) are not performing well, making it even more likely that the commenter is criticizing the Bills' performance. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN] despite the lack of explicit words referring to the in-group, as the comment implicitly refers to an in-group player's poor throw. '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since it implicitly refers to the in-group team.	The commenter is likely criticizing the in-group (Bills) by describing a throw as 'fucking shit'. This is a typical reaction for fans who are frustrated with their own team's performance. Since there is no explicit word/phrase referring to the in-group or out-group, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is implicitly referring to the in-group. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	1664136206.0	bills	dolphins	-MarchToTheSea-		0.0	0.263039648532867	[5]

In this context, "Weddle" refers to Eric Weddle, who is a player for the Rams (in-group), and "gronk" refers to Rob Gronkowski, who is a player for the Buccaneers (out-group). Despite the relatively high win probability for the Rams, the comment is highlighting a specific play for its humor rather than the overall performance. Therefore, "Weddle" should be tagged as [IN] because he is a member of the in-group, and "gronk" should be tagged as [OUT] because he is a member of the out-group. This correctly associates each player with their respective team, properly tagging the comment and list of referring expressions.	The comment is about Weddle and Gronk, who are players on the Rams and Buccaneers, respectively. The commenter supports the Rams, making Weddle an in-group player and Gronk an out-group player. Therefore, 'Weddle' should be tagged with [IN] and 'gronk' should be tagged with [OUT]. The phrase 'cracked me up' indicates amusement at the situation, suggesting that Weddle's action is being viewed from the perspective of a Rams fan.	1642969359.0	rams	buccaneers	wolfsrudel_red	White & Yellow #88	13.0	0.6166372895240779	[5, 5]

'Mariota' refers to Marcus Mariota, the quarterback for the Falcons, the in-group team, which warrants the [IN] tag. The phrase "we'd" implicitly refers to the in-group team, as the commenter identifies with the Falcons. Despite the low win probability, the critique and hypothetical scenario are directed at players of both teams, with an implicit focus on the in-group team and its performance. Therefore, "we'd" properly receives the [IN] tag referring to the team the commenter supports.	The comment refers to both the in-group and out-group quarterbacks' performance. 'Pickett' is the quarterback for the Steelers, the out-group, so it should be tagged [OUT] as it clearly refers to an out-group player. 'Mariota' is the quarterback for the Falcons, the in-group, so it should be tagged [IN] since the commenter supports the Falcons. The word 'we'd' implicitly refers to the in-group since the commenter is discussing how combining traits of the quarterbacks could benefit their own team. Therefore, 'we'd' is tagged [IN].	1670183744.0	falcons	steelers	ATLjoe93		17.0	0.122207820415497	[5, 5, 5]

Despite the relatively high win probability, the commenter's focus is on a repeated mistake by a player, which suggests criticism of their own team's performance. Therefore, 'Moses' should be tagged with [IN], since it refers to a player from the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The comment refers to false starts committed by "Moses," who is a player. Since the commenter supports the Ravens and the criticism is directed at a specific player without a negative connotation that would indicate an opposing team's player, it is reasonable to assume that "Moses" is a player on the in-group team, the Ravens. Therefore, "Moses" should be tagged as [IN]. This explains why the reference to "Moses" is tagged as [IN] in the comment.	1665943751.0	ravens	giants	Jeremiah_Edwards	 :PBIRD:	2.0	0.620863318443298	[5]

When expressing frustration or exasperation, it is common for fans to focus on impactful plays made by the opposing team, hinting that 'he' refers to a player from the out-group who might have just made a decisive move or play. Hence, 'he' is tagged as [OUT] since it refers to an out-group player.	The comment uses 'he' without specifying the player, but given that it is a game between the Browns and the Packers, and the phrase 'he's outta there' often refers to a player being removed or ejected. The commenter is likely referring to an out-group player, especially given no indication that the comment expresses concern or sympathy which an in-group fan might show towards their own player. Thus, 'he' should be tagged [OUT].	1640470581.0	browns	packers	Big_Green_Piccolo	:chubb:	1.0	0.178663730621338	[5]

Commenters are more prone to criticize their own team when things aren't going well. Since there is no explicit mention of the in-group or the out-group, the comment implicitly refers to the in-group (Raiders), as it is typical for fans to critique their own team's decisions. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' since the critique is implicitly about the in-group team's play call.	The comment criticizes a conservative play call, which is usually a critical remark about one's own team rather than an opponent's team. Since there's no explicit reference to the in-group, out-group, or any other team, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN]. This indicates the commenter's dissatisfaction with a play called by the in-group (Raiders). Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] since the comment implicitly refers to the in-group.	1642291565.0	raiders	bengals	pkeller001	:Happy_Mark:	7.0	0.089713536202908	[5]

[SENT] [IN] know who was calling the plays last year 	['Defense', 'We']	[(7, 14), (49, 51)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment is critical of the team's performance, particularly their defense. In the first sentence, 'Defense' is mentioned without any qualification, and since commenters tend to criticize their own team more harshly, it is reasonable to infer that this is referring to the in-group, which is the Dolphins. Thus, 'Defense' is tagged [IN]. The second sentence uses 'We', which typically implies the fan base or supporters of the same team as the commenter, indicating that 'We' refers to the in-group as well. Therefore, 'We' should also be tagged [IN]. The win probability of 45.4% means the game is quite close, but this doesn't change the inference that the commenter is discussing their own team in a critical manner. Hence, both 'Defense' and 'We' should be tagged as referring to the in-group.	The commenter is expressing dissatisfaction with their team's performance, indicative of an in-group perspective. 'Defense' in the first sentence is criticism directly aimed at the in-group without any qualifications, making it clear it's about the Dolphins. 'We' in the second sentence typically refers to the group the commenter identifies with, thus referring to the in-group. So, 'Defense' should be tagged [IN], and 'We' should also be tagged [IN].	1665337572.0	dolphins	jets	SanSoren		0.0	0.45353353023528997	[5, 5]

['Jones', 'he']	[(14, 19), (37, 39)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The win probability for the in-group Packers is relatively high at 85.9%, indicating they are likely performing well overall. However, the commenter is focusing on a specific player, Jones, who is presumably a player for the Packers, and is expressing exasperation at his tendency to fumble in critical moments. The phrase "I love Jones" suggests an attachment and support for the player, which is consistent with referring to an in-group team member. Therefore, "Jones" should be tagged [IN] because he is part of the in-group team. Similarly, "he" in the phrase "but holy fuck is he addicted to fumbling" is a pronoun referring back to Jones, and should also be tagged [IN] because it refers to the same in-group player. Thus, 'Jones' and 'he' should be tagged as [IN] for referring to in-group entities.	The commenter mentions 'Jones' and 'he', who is likely Aaron Jones, a player for the Packers. The comment expresses affection ('I love Jones') but also criticizes him ('addicted to fumbling in big games'), which is something a fan would typically do about a player on their own team. Thus, 'Jones' and 'he' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to an in-group player, the Packers.	1673231838.0	packers	lions	freefish69		6.0	0.859099805355072	[4, 4]

['Refs', 'we']	[(7, 11), (37, 39)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]']	The in-group team is the Lions, and the out-group is the Packers. The first sentence states "Refs have fucked us in a game we aren't even playing in", indicating that the referees (Refs) have negatively influenced the in-group team (Lions) without them being directly involved in the game currently being referenced. Therefore, "Refs" should be tagged as [OTHER] since they are not part of either the in-group team or the opposing team. The word "we" refers to the in-group team (Lions). Even though the win probability for the in-group (Lions) at that time is relatively high, the comment is expressing frustration about a situation affecting their team from an external source (the referees), which justifies the tags provided.	The comment 'Refs have fucked us in a game we aren't even playing in' suggests that the complaint is about the referees in a game that does not involve the in-group (Lions). 'Refs' are being blamed for a situation affecting the Lions indirectly, likely in a game involving other teams. Thus, 'Refs' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The word 'we' refers to the in-group team (Lions) as it indicates that the commenter is feeling the impact on their team. Hence, it should be tagged as [IN]. The remaining sentences do not contain explicit references to any team, so they do not need tagging.	1673224264.0	lions	packers	BabyYodasSmooveAss		4.0	0.704978406429291	[5, 5]

['Washington', 'they', 'our guys']	[(12, 22), (36, 40), (67, 75)]	['[OUT]', '[OUT]', '[IN]']	The commenter is clearly expressing frustration towards the opponent team 'Washington', in this case tagged as [OUT], as indicated by the derogatory comment 'Fuck Washington'. This explicit naming leads to the phrase 'Washington' being tagged as [OUT]. Additionally, the pronoun 'they' in the second sentence refers back to 'Washington' and should also be tagged as [OUT]. The phrase 'our guys' in the second sentence implies the players the commenter supports, which in this instance is the Cowboys, thus it should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability is 100%, indicating the Cowboys are almost certainly going to win, which could be causing the commenter to focus more on the opponent's conduct rather than the score. Thus 'they' and 'our guys' correctly refer to the out-group and in-group respectively in the context of this comment.	The commenter is a Cowboys supporter, and their frustration is directed towards Washington, the out-group opponent. 'Washington' is the name of the out-group team and should be tagged [OUT]. In the second sentence, 'they' refers to Washington players, thus it should also be tagged [OUT]. 'our guys' refers to Cowboys players, whom the commenter supports, hence it should be tagged [IN].	1640573869.0	cowboys	washington	MerleTravisJennings		1.0	0.999686479568481	[5, 5, 5]

Given the context, 'They' in the third sentence is likely referring to the out-group team (Titans), especially since the in-group (Chiefs) has a high win probability, making it more plausible that the commenter is highlighting a weakness of the opponent. Therefore, 'They' should be tagged as [OUT]. The other sentences do not contain explicit references to the in-group or out-group team; thus, the target output correctly doesn't tag those sentences with any labels.	The commenter seems surprised and incredulous about the performance of the opponent team, suspecting that they (Titans) do not have a single wide receiver with a catch. This kind of reaction is typical when discussing the out-group, especially when the in-group is not being mentioned directly but is being compared indirectly. Therefore, 'They' in the third sentence should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the opponent team (Titans). The other sentences are not explicitly about the in-group or out-group, so they don't require specific tagging beyond the sentence marker.	1667795256.0	chiefs	titans	TheCreed20		9.0	0.679146230220795	[2]

Since "him" refers to a player now on the Panthers and "Vikings" is another NFL team that is not the current opponent (Falcons), "him" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player, and "Vikings" should be tagged [OTHER] since it refers to another team in the NFL not involved in the current game.	The commenter mentions getting 'him' from the Vikings, indicating that 'him' is a new acquisition by the in-group team, which is the Panthers. Therefore, 'him' should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to a player now part of the in-group. The 'Vikings' are another team within the NFL but not the current opponent (Falcons), so 'Vikings' should be tagged as [OTHER].	1635700538.0	panthers	falcons	Looseleaf17	Ice Up Son	2.0	0.45280659198761	[5, 5]

['turner', 'Gibson', 'him']	[(44, 50), (72, 78), (105, 108)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is discussing the performance of players on the Commanders, which is the in-group team. 'Turner' is indicated as responsible for giving up points, which fans typically do when criticizing their own team's players. Likewise, 'Gibson' is praised for his performance, and such positive sentiment is typically reserved for players of the team one supports. The reference to 'him' in "give him the fucking ball on 4th and 1" also pertains to Gibson, thus referring to an in-group player. Therefore, 'Turner', 'Gibson', and 'him' should all be tagged [IN].	The comment's tone and content indicate frustration and praise directed at players associated with the in-group team, the Commanders. In the first sentence, the reference to "turner" suggests accountability, commonly attributed to a member of one's own team, thereby tagging "turner" as [IN]. In the second sentence, "Gibson" is lauded for his performance, an indication of the commenter supporting a player from their own team, tagging "Gibson" as [IN]. Additionally, "him" in the same context refers to "Gibson," further necessitating the [IN] tag. Therefore, these expressions are tagged correctly as in-group.	1667764935.0	commanders	washington	Freshpots201		-2.0	0.455682456493378	[5, 5, 5]

Phrases like "Let's go!" and "Turn it around now!!!" are typically directed towards the in-group team in an attempt to encourage them. There is no explicit mention of the Patriots, but the context suggests that the commenter is addressing their own team, hoping for a turnaround. Therefore, both sentences should be tagged with [IN] since the comments are implicitly about the in-group team.	The commenter is expressing enthusiasm and encouragement, which implies support for their team. In the context of sports comments, phrases like "Let's go!" and "Turn it around now!!!" are typically used by fans to cheer on their team. Since the in-group team is the Patriots, both sentences are implicitly referring to the in-group.

The commenter expresses frustration by claiming the game is "rigged," which often implies dissatisfaction with the officials or the league rather than a specific team. Since it does not explicitly mention the Browns (in-group) or the Cardinals (out-group), but rather is a generalized frustration, the entire sentence is tagged as [OTHER] reflecting discontent with external factors outside the specific teams playing. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[OTHER]' as it refers to neither the in-group nor the out-group specifically.	The comment "I'm done watching this rigged shit" does not refer explicitly to either the in-group (Browns) or the out-group (Cardinals) teams. The frustration expressed by the commenter implies dissatisfaction with the game but does not point to any specific team. Thus, the sentence as a whole is tagged as [OTHER], indicating it doesn't reference any team directly, either in-group or out-group. The tag '[SENT]' encompasses the entire sentence which is appropriate as it indirectly refers to another NFL entity disrupting the game experience.	1634510668.0	browns	cardinals	Cavslebron232		0.0	0.0027843713760376	[5]

['Jimmy']	[(56, 61)]	['[IN]']	The win probability for the in-group team, the 49ers, is quite low at 21.9%, indicating they are in a losing position or struggling in the game against the Chiefs. The comment mentions "The lengths people will go to deflect blame from Jimmy," which suggests that 'Jimmy' is being defended by fans, typically done by supporters of the in-group. In this case, 'Jimmy' refers to Jimmy Garoppolo, the quarterback of the 49ers. The act of deflecting blame from him indicates that the commenter is probably talking about their own team's player, reflecting the tendency of fans to defend or excuse the performance of their own players during tough situations. The second sentence, "Just nuts," is an expression of surprise or frustration regarding the situation described in the first sentence. Therefore, 'Jimmy' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team, the 49ers.	The comment refers to "Jimmy," who is likely Jimmy Garoppolo, a player for the 49ers. The fact that the commenter is discussing people going to lengths to deflect blame from Jimmy indicates a level of protection or support, typically something fans do for players of their own team. Thus, "Jimmy" should be tagged as [IN] since he is a part of the in-group (49ers) that the commenter supports. The sentence "Just nuts" does not explicitly reference any team or player but is in the context of the previous sentence, which is about an in-group player.	1666563589.0	49ers	chiefs	wifflewaffle23	:jerseyaway80: Jerry Rice	1.0	0.218945235013962	[5]

Given the low win probability, the commenter seems displeased with their team's performance, suggesting that "play calling" is in reference to their own team's strategy. Hence, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team, even though no specific entity (like a coach or player's name) is mentioned. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' since the comment as a whole implies criticism of the in-group team.	The comment expresses frustration with the play calling, which a fan would typically do when referencing their own team rather than the opponent. Since there is no explicit word or phrase referring to either the in-group (Packers) or out-group (Dolphins), it is implied that the comment is about the in-group.

Fans often use "we" to refer to their own team, indicating a sense of belonging and support. Despite the relatively low win probability, it suggests that the commenter is likely dissatisfied with the current situation and is expressing a desire for improvement. Therefore, "we" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team supported by the commenter.	'we' here likely refers to the in-group, which is the Jaguars. The commenter is likely asking for something from another team, implying that their own team needs something that the out-group or another team has.

The high win probability suggests that the team is likely doing well, but the comment indicates a general sentiment of stress associated with watching their games. This is typical for dedicated fans who remain anxious regardless of the game situation. Therefore, 'Panthers' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter explicitly mentions being stressed during a "Panthers" game, which indicates that they are talking about the in-group team they support. Therefore, "Panthers" should be tagged as [IN] since it directly refers to the in-group.

Given that the in-group team is the Chiefs, the quarterback being referred to should be a player on the Chiefs, which matches the supportive tone of the comment. Each instance of "my QB" and "he" in this context refers to the quarterback of the in-group team. The use of "my QB" indicates personal attachment and support, confirming that it refers to the in-group's quarterback. The overall high win probability further supports this, as the in-group is likely performing well, reinforcing the trust and positive sentiments towards the quarterback. Therefore, all the references to "my QB" and "he" should be tagged with [IN], as they denote entities from the in-group team.	The commenter expresses strong confidence in their quarterback, which indicates a positive attitude typical of a fan towards their own team. The repeated use of "I trust my QB" and "I know he can" suggests that the commenter is talking about the quarterback of the in-group team they support (the Chiefs). "my QB" in the first and last sentences, and "he" in the subsequent sentences are all referring to the same entity—the Chiefs' quarterback. Therefore, "my QB" and "he" should be tagged as [IN]. Each sentence conveys positive attributes about the quarterback, reinforcing the idea that the subject is the in-group team's quarterback.	1635810637.0	chiefs	giants	Mild111	Chris Jones #95	18.0	0.797692358493805	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

The exclamation of 'What a huge play' is likely one of excitement or surprise, typically from the perspective of a fan commending their own team for a rare moment of success given the in-group's disadvantageous situation. Therefore, the sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group team (Seahawks) making a significant play, even though there are no explicit references to the team or players. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment can be understood as pertaining to the in-group team.	The comment 'What a huge play' is expressing excitement and admiration for a notable event on the field, likely referring to a successful and favorable moment for the team the commenter supports. It is unlikely that the commenter would express such enthusiasm for a play made by the out-group (Cardinals). Thus, without an explicit mention of any team or player, the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group (Seahawks).

The win probability for the Cowboys is very low at 5.0%, which aligns with the commenter acknowledging defeat.The phrase "We ca n't put up enough points to keep up with this offense" clearly refers to the in-group team (Cowboys) and their perceived inability to score sufficiently, while "this offense" refers to the opposing team (Eagles), noted for their strong offensive showing. Therefore, "We" should be tagged [IN] as it signifies the Cowboys, and "this offense" should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the Eagles.The rest of the comment discusses the overarching situation of the game without referencing specific entities, correctly tagged as [SENT] and no missed entities.	The comment expresses a sense of resignation about the game's outcome, which suggests an emotional connection typically associated with the in-group team.

The word "They" in the first sentence is referring to the commenter's team, the Patriots, since fans often use "they" to refer to their in-group team in a critical context. The second part of the comment continues this criticism by making a disparaging remark about the coaching staff, which is again something directed at their own team's coaching staff rather than an opponent's.The win probability is 37.8%, indicating that the in-group isn't doing very well at the moment, which supports the critical tone of the comment. Therefore, the entities in the comment are directed towards the in-group (Patriots).Thus, "They" and "the coaching staff" should be tagged [IN] because they both refer to the Patriots.The commenter is criticizing the in-group team's (Patriots) play-calling and coaching staff, which is typical behavior for a frustrated fan. "They" is used to refer to the Patriots team, and "the coaching staff" is specifying the Patriots' coaching staff.

Similarly, "the coaching staff" is likely referring to the in-group's coaching staff, as fans are usually more preoccupied with and critical of their own team's decision-makers.

The use of 'us' suggests that the commenter is a Chiefs fan, and they are critiquing their own team's coach for not improving since a previous game. Given that the Chiefs are the in-group, 'Spags' should be tagged with [IN], which is reflected in the target tagging. The critique is directed internally towards the in-group coach, despite the relatively high win probability, indicating a concern with the team's performance or strategy. Hence, 'Spags' correctly refers to an in-group entity.	The comment is critical of 'Spags', who is short for Steve Spagnuolo, the defensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs. Since 'us' implies that the commenter is talking from the perspective of a Chiefs fan, 'Spags' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team, the Chiefs.

Given that the in-group is the Steelers, and they are playing against the Bengals, 'Burrows' should be tagged as [OUT] since he belongs to the opponent team. The phrase 'I love it' in the second sentence indicates satisfaction which is consistent with the high win probability for the in-group team - they are doing well, and the commenter is enjoying the poor performance of the out-group player. Therefore, the correct tagged output is with 'Burrows' as [OUT].	The commenter appears to enjoy seeing Burrows perform poorly, which aligns with their support for the Steelers and disdain for the Bengals, the out-group. Burrows is a player for the Bengals, so he should be tagged with [OUT]. There is no explicit mention of the in-group in the comment. Hence, '[OUT]' correctly tags 'Burrows' and no additional tags are needed for other words or phrases in the comment.	1662920764.0	steelers	bengals	p-mode		7.0	0.700950622558594	[5]

['He', 'Matt Ryan', 'Wentz', 'He']	[(7, 9), (23, 32), (50, 55), (68, 70)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[OUT]', '[OUT]']	The comment is about personnel decisions related to quarterbacks on the Colts, the in-group team. The first and third sentences discuss a figure ('he') who is making decisions about the team lineup, which is implicitly about someone associated with the Colts. 'Matt Ryan' is a quarterback for the Colts, so these mentions should be tagged as in-group ([IN]).The second and third sentences imply that 'he' wanted Wentz back and then that 'he' quit on the team. Carson Wentz, while formerly of the Colts, is no longer on the team and is now with Washington, the out-group team. The commenter appears to be lamenting the coaching or management decisions. Therefore, 'Wentz' and the second 'he' referring to someone linked to Wentz/now with Washington, should be tagged as out-group ([OUT]).Thus, the respective entities are tagged correctly based on these plausible associations:- 'He' (first mention) and 'Matt Ryan' are tagged [IN] as they refer to the in-group (Colts).- 'Wentz' and 'He' (second mention) are tagged [OUT] as they refer to the out-group (Washington).	The commenter's criticism and mentioning of specific players indicates that the first "He" is likely an in-group coach or manager who had preferences for certain players. "Matt Ryan" is an in-group quarterback for the Colts, hence tagged as [IN]. "Wentz" is associated with Washington (the out-group) since the comment implies a return, making "Wentz" [OUT]. The second "He" in the third sentence refers to Wentz again, who is implied to have quit, thus making the third "He" also an out-group reference. Therefore, the tagging accurately reflects the distinctions between the in-group and out-group entities being discussed.	1667165279.0	colts	washington	Rs3vsosrs		9.0	0.367140889167786	[5, 5, 5, 2]

The win probability for the in-group (Panthers) is relatively high, indicating they are likely winning, but the comment suggests a bias perceived in the commentators. "the saints" refers to the out-group team (Saints) and should therefore be tagged as [OUT].

Given that the in-group team is the Seahawks, 'Pete' should be tagged as [IN] to denote that he is part of the in-group. Additionally, the use of 'we' in the second sentence typically refers to the team the commenter supports, which is the Seahawks. Therefore, 'we' should also be tagged as [IN]. The low win probability indicates that the Seahawks are likely losing, which aligns with the comment's sentiment around significant changes if certain conditions (reaching the championship round) are not met. Thus, 'Pete' and 'we' are correctly identified as referring to the in-group (Seahawks).	The commenter is discussing the future of Pete Carroll, who is the coach of the Seahawks, the in-group team. Therefore, 'Pete' should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, 'we' refers to the team the commenter supports, implying the Seahawks. Thus, 'we' should also be tagged as [IN]. Since both tagged expressions, 'Pete' and 'we,' refer to the in-group, the tagging is correct.	1636935107.0	seahawks	packers	shrimpynut		1.0	0.0025779008865359776	[5, 5]

They discuss potential hires for their team, indicating dissatisfaction and the need for a rebuild. 'We' and "we'd" refer to the in-group team (Steelers), therefore they should be tagged [IN]. The names of potential hires (Cowher, McVay, and Belichick) are well-known NFL figures but not currently associated with the Steelers or Vikings, so these should be tagged [OTHER] since they refer to other (neutral) entities not relevant to the current game. The phrase 'all the yinzers' is a local term for Pittsburgh fans and is included with 'we'.	The commenter is discussing potential coaches for the Steelers (in-group team). The phrase 'We' in the first sentence refers to the Steelers and should be tagged [IN]. The names 'Cowher', 'McVay', and 'Belichick' are each associated with other teams in the NFL and should therefore be tagged [OTHER]. 'we'd' in the first sentence and 'We' in the second sentence also refer to the Steelers and thus should be tagged [IN]. The other names like 'Hank Williams Jr.' and 'Goebbels' are not related to any NFL team and therefore are not tagged.

['Their']	[(7, 12)]	['[OUT]']	The pronoun "Their" is likely referring to the out-group team since the in-group (Buccaneers) has a very low win probability, indicating they are probably on the defensive at this moment in the game. The commenter is predicting that the opponent team (Rams) is going to run the ball, so "Their" should be tagged as [OUT].	The pronoun "Their" in this context is likely a misspelling of "They're" or "Their," and it refers to the out-group team, which is the Rams, indicating that the Rams are going to run the ball. Fans typically use "their" to refer to the opposing team in a predictive or analytical statement. Therefore, "Their" should be tagged [OUT] as it is predicting an action of the out-group team.	1642979223.0	buccaneers	rams	FUCKYOUINYOURFACE	:bucslogo: 	2.0	0.0598487257957459	[5]

Since the commenter is talking about holding Parsons, it implies that another team (in this case, the 49ers, the out-group) is committing a foul against the in-group player. Therefore, 'parsons' should be tagged with [IN], and '[SENT]' is not needed additionally as the specific entity 'parsons' is mentioned and tagged correctly.	The commenter is raising an issue with "Holding," which is usually a complaint made about a penalty not being called or an unfair situation. Parsons is a player for the Cowboys, which is the in-group team that the commenter supports. Therefore, "parsons" should be tagged as [IN] since the commenter is likely expressing frustration at the treatment of an in-group player.	1642369681.0	cowboys	49ers	TheHossDelgado		1.0	0.422860811564662	[5]

'Trubisky' is the current quarterback, and 'Ben' (referring to Ben Roethlisberger) is the previous quarterback. The commenter is expressing dissatisfaction with Trubisky, saying he needs to go and that he is not a suitable replacement for Ben. Given the extremely low win probability, it makes sense that the commenter is critical of their own team's performance. Therefore, both 'Trubisky' and 'Ben' should be tagged [IN] since they are players of the in-group team, the Steelers. The sentences reflect dissatisfaction with the in-group's players, confirming the assignment of the [IN] tags.	The commenter is discussing Trubisky and Ben, both of whom are associated with the Steelers. 'Trubisky' is being criticized, which fans typically do for their own team's players, implying an expectation of high performance. Therefore, 'Trubisky' should be tagged '[IN]'. Similarly, 'Ben' refers to Ben Roethlisberger, a well-known former player for the Steelers, signifying another in-group reference. Hence, 'Ben' should also be tagged '[IN]'. The sentence "[SENT] He's not [IN]'s replacement, that is clear" further clarifies that the commenter is talking about their own team as they mention "replacement", indicating an internal team issue.	1663901765.0	steelers	browns	Lovelylives		2.0	0.05784565210342396	[5, 3]

In this case, since the in-group team is the Packers, "our" refers to the Packers' deep ball stats. Despite a reasonably high win probability indicating that the Packers are likely doing well overall, the commenter is focusing on a negative aspect of their team's performance this year, namely the deep ball stats. Therefore, "our" should be tagged as [IN], indicating that it refers to the in-group team.	The use of "our" indicates that the commenter is referring to the team they support, which is the Packers in this case. Complaining about their own team's performance is typical fan behavior. Therefore, "our" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Packers.	1667759475.0	packers	lions	Tetsudo11	:AronJone:	1.0	0.6968317627906799	[5]

In the context of an NFL game, it could be regarding a high-profile player acquisition, coach hiring, or other strategic move that is paying off, despite the low win probability indicating that the in-group team (Steelers) is currently losing. The use of phrases like "LETS GO" and "BABY" are indicative of fan enthusiasm and celebration, which aligns more closely with the sentiments of a fan supporting their own team, rather than an opponent team, even if they are not currently winning. Thus, the comment is implicitly about the in-group, expressing a belief that their money and efforts are proving to be worthwhile in the long run.Given that the sentence is referring to an in-group decision or event implicitly, with the enthusiasm directed towards the in-group, it should be tagged with '[IN]' and the entire sentence '[SENT]' is the referring expression.	The exclamation and celebratory tone of the comment suggest that the commenter is excited about some kind of successful investment or financial decision made by the in-group team (Steelers). Fans typically take pride in and celebrate their own team's successful moves, whether it's a significant player signing, a stadium upgrade, or some other form of investment paying off. Since there's no explicit mention of a specific in-group entity but the context clearly implies satisfaction with their own team, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN].	1631469957.0	steelers	bills	siirka	:tomlin1a::tomlin1b:Encroachment	3.0	0.202375829219818	[5]

The in-group here is the Steelers, and since Diontae Johnson is part of the in-group team, it makes sense to tag "diontae" as [IN]. Although the win probability is slightly above 50%, indicating that the Steelers might be performing moderately well overall, the comment is focused on a specific play or player's performance. Therefore, "diontae" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	The commenter likely supports the Steelers, as indicated by the in-group. Diontae Johnson is a player for the Steelers, so the comment is about an in-group player's performance.

In the first sentence, 'Refs' refers to the officiating referees, who are not part of either team playing but rather a neutral party. Therefore, 'Refs' should be tagged as [OTHER]. In the second sentence, 'We' refers to the Commanders as the commenter identifies with their supported team and acknowledges that the team has performed poorly. Thus, 'We' should be tagged as [IN]. Therefore, the target labels and the referring expressions are correctly tagged.	The commenter mentions that the 'Refs have been bad' in the first sentence, and referees are neutral third-party entities in the game and not part of either team. This means that 'Refs' should be tagged with [OTHER] since they are neither the in-group (Commanders) nor the out-group (Washington). The second sentence's 'We' refers to the in-group team, which is the Commanders; fans typically use 'we' to describe their own team's performance.

The pronoun "our" is a strong in-group indicator, commonly used by commenters to refer to their own team. Despite the favorable game state, the commenter acknowledges a potential lapse in their team's performance, which suggests a high level of engagement and accountability towards their supported team. Thus, "our" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers directly to the in-group team, the Chiefs.	The use of the word 'our' is inclusive, suggesting that the commenter is blaming their own team for any damage caused on this drive. Since the in-group team is the Chiefs, it implies that the damage on this drive is considered the Chiefs' fault. Therefore, 'our' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, and the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team.	1641679036.0	chiefs	broncos	uwanmirrondarrah	Patrick Mahomes #2	13.0	0.899691253900528	[5]

Fans in such situations often criticize and show frustration towards their own team's players, hinting at making changes (such as replacing the quarterback). The sentence "Time to off him" suggests getting rid of a player, which is something fans would say about their own team's player when they are unhappy with their performance. "He's not even a good QB" further criticizes that player's skill, which confirms that both "him" and "He" refer to a player from the in-group (the Jets) whom the commenter supports but is disappointed with. Thus, 'him' and 'He' should both be tagged as [IN].	The comment reflects frustration and criticism, likely directed at someone associated with the in-group team. The phrase 'Time to off him' suggests a desire to remove someone from the team, typically something a fan would say about their own team's player and not an opponent's. The second sentence, 'He's not even a good QB lol,' continues this criticism, targeting a quarterback who is underperforming, which aligns with expressions of dissatisfaction with an in-group player. Therefore, both 'him' and 'He' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to a player on the Jets, the in-group team.	1672614942.0	jets	seahawks	scruffy4	:sauce:	2.0	0.06827014684677102	[5, 5]

The phrase 'the offense' is being used to refer to the Packers' own offensive unit. 'He' refers back to Aaron Jones, further indicating the commenter's focus on the player's role within the team. Given the low win probability, it makes sense the commenter is expressing frustration about the team's performance and suggesting ways to improve it. Thus, 'Aaron Jones,' 'the offense,' and 'He' should all be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group team or its player.	The commenter is discussing a player, Aaron Jones, who plays for the Packers, the in-group team. This indicates that the comment is focused on the in-group's players. The complaint about Jones being underutilized is something a fan would say about their own team's player.

The use of "We" indicates the commenter is referring to their own team. Specific players mentioned in the comment (Nelson, Leonard, JT, Buckner, Stewart, Pittman) are all part of the Colts roster, making them in-group references. Therefore, each instance of "We" and the named players refer to the in-group. Despite the low win probability, which suggests the Colts are likely losing, the discussion is about potential trades, a strategic consideration for the future beyond the current game's outcome.  'SENT' tagged with [IN] captures sentences that implicitly refer to the in-group team without specifying names but discussing strategy for the team.Thus, 'We' (5 instances), 'Nelson', 'Leonard', 'JT', 'Buckner', 'Stewart', and 'Pittman' are tagged as [IN] because they all pertain to the in-group, abiding by the logic that the commenter is addressing their own team and players throughout the comment without mentioning the Steelers.	The comment contains several mentions of in-group team players and assets, evidenced by the repeated use of 'we' and 'our'. This indicates that the commenter is talking about their own team, the Colts. Hence, 'We' in each sentence should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group. The names 'Nelson' and 'Leonard' in the second sentence are clearly players on the Colts, so they should be tagged [IN]. In the third sentence, 'JT' is short for Jonathan Taylor, a player for the Colts, so both 'JT' and the prior reference 'we' should be tagged [IN]. Similarly, in the fourth sentence, 'Buckner' and 'Stewart' are also players on the in-group team and thus should be tagged [IN]. Finally, in the fifth sentence, the reference 'we' and the name 'Pittman' (another Colts player) should be tagged [IN] since they refer to the in-group. Overall, all these references point to the team and its players, justifying their tagging as [IN].	1669690549.0	colts	steelers	XC_Stallion92	Fire Ballard	1.0	0.172918289899826	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

'Mike' (Mike Williams) and 'Herbert' (Justin Herbert) are both players for the Chargers. The commenter is expressing enthusiasm and approval for actions made by 'Mike', and also provides a critique of a throw by 'Herbert,' indicating the player's significant impact on the game, whether positive or negative. Thus, 'Mike' in the first and third sentences, and 'Herbert' in the second sentence should be tagged [IN] since they are members of the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The commenter is a supporter of the Chargers and the comment includes compliments and criticisms directed at players from their own team. - In the first sentence, "Mike" is likely referring to Mike Williams, a player for the Chargers. The excited tone ("Ayyyyye") suggests appreciation or recognition, which fans usually express for their in-group players. Therefore, "Mike" should be tagged as [IN]. - In the second sentence, "Herbert" refers to Justin Herbert, the quarterback for the Chargers. Even though the comment criticizes a throw by Herbert, fans often critique their own players more closely, indicating they are talking about someone from the in-group. Thus, "Herbert" should be tagged as [IN]. - In the third sentence, the commendation "Good play Mike" again refers to Mike Williams. Complimenting a good play is typical for fans discussing their own team's players. Hence, "Mike" should again be tagged as [IN].Overall, the commenter is talking about players from the Chargers, their supported team, which is why all relevant mentions are tagged with [IN].	1632086125.0	chargers	cowboys	MattBallzzzy	bolt	1.0	0.371422350406647	[5, 5, 5]

Therefore, 'Averett' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	The comment is complaining about Averett, implying dissatisfaction with his performance. Since the commenter is a Ravens fan, Averett is likely a player from the in-group (Ravens).

Since the in-group is the Packers, the mention of Rodgers directly pertains to them. The win probability for the Packers is relatively low in this instance, which could be why the commenter is dissatisfied or pessimistic about Rodgers' situation. Thus, 'Rodgers' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a key player of the in-group team.	The commenter likely supports the Packers as they are their in-group team. "Rodgers" refers to Aaron Rodgers, who is the quarterback for the Packers. Since the comment is critical and reflects frustration or disappointment, it suggests the commenter is deeply invested in Rodgers' performance, reinforcing that the criticism is aimed at a player from their own supported team. Therefore, "Rodgers" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an entity from the in-group.	1673237184.0	packers	lions	CsHaze91		4.0	0.258521437644959	[5]

Robert Saleh is the head coach of the Jets, making him a member of the in-group in this context. Joe Burrow is the quarterback for the Bengals, hence a member of the out-group. The phrase is hypothetical, suggesting that if the in-group did something questionable or aggressive towards Burrow (out-group), the NFL might retaliate by releasing sensitive information related to Saleh (in-group). This hypothetical situation reflects in-group and out-group dynamics. Thus, 'Saleh' should be tagged [IN] because he is part of the in-group, and 'Burrow' should be tagged [OUT] because he is part of the out-group. This correctly associates the individuals within the in-group and out-group context of the NFL game being discussed.	The comment mentions both 'Saleh' and 'Burrow' in the context of the game. Saleh refers to Robert Saleh, the head coach of the Jets, which is the in-group team. Therefore, 'Saleh' should be tagged [IN]. Burrow refers to Joe Burrow, the quarterback of the Bengals, which is the out-group team. Thus, 'Burrow' should be tagged [OUT]. The NFL is mentioned in the comment, but it's tagged as [SENT] since it doesn't specifically refer to either the in-group or out-group. The sentence as a whole is essentially saying that if the in-group did something to the out-group's player, the NFL would take action, showing implicit in-group and out-group dynamics.	1635707281.0	jets	bengals	CaptainBunderpants	:OtherJoeDWizard: 	11.0	0.283087283372879	[5, 5]

The commenter is talking about a player whose contract status they are uncertain about, but there is no additional context in the comment that ties the player to either the in-group (Titans) or out-group (Jaguars). Given the lack of immediate context linking 'he' to either participating team, 'he' is tagged as referring to an entity from another NFL team. Thus, 'he' should be tagged with [OTHER] since it refers to a player from another team not involved in the current game.	The commenter is discussing a player mentioned using 'he' and speculating about their contract status. Neither the Titans nor the Jaguars are mentioned directly, which indicates the player in question is likely not from either team involved in this game. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged as [OTHER] since it refers to a player from another team in the NFL.	1673144757.0	titans	jaguars	Mythic514	:henryface:	1.0	0.574337244033813	[5]

Tua refers to Tua Tagovailoa, the quarterback for the Dolphins, who the commenter supports, so "Tua" should be tagged [IN]. The term "the Rapist" is a derogatory label used by some NFL fans to refer to Ben Roethlisberger, the quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, who has faced sexual assault allegations in the past. Since Ben Roethlisberger and the Steelers are not the Dolphins' opponents in this game (the Bills are the opponents), "the Rapist" does not refer to the out-group. Therefore, the phrase "the Rapist" is not directly tagged, aligning with the provided target and referring expressions.	'Tua' is the quarterback for the Dolphins, the in-group team the commenter supports. The use of '>' indicates a comparison, implying the commenter values Tua higher, which fans typically do for players from their own team. The term 'the Rapist' is a derogatory reference to another well-known NFL player, but since it's not explicitly a Bills player, it is not tagged with a group label. Therefore, 'Tua' is correctly tagged with '[IN]' since it refers to a member of the in-group, and 'the Rapist' remains untagged as it's not clearly identified as part of the out-group (Bills).	1635700633.0	dolphins	bills	gavi75		7.0	0.13131821155548096	[5]

Since Green Bay refers to the Packers, the in-group team, the lack of faith in the defense fits with the low win probability suggesting that the team is not performing well. Thus, "Green Bay" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group. The rest of the sentence doesn't mention any specific entities, so it doesn't need additional tagging.	The comment criticizes the defense, and since there is no qualifier to suggest it is an out-group or other-group, it is likely targeted at the in-group team. 'Green Bay' refers to the Packers, who are the in-group team the commenter supports, thus it should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, 'Green Bay' should be tagged [IN] as it is the referring expression of the in-group defense being criticized.	1671994742.0	packers	dolphins	Agreeable_Minute_359		7.0	0.234970465302467	[5]

['The Jets']	[(7, 15)]	['[IN]']	The comment mentions "The Jets," which is the in-group team supported by the commenter. The sentiment expressed in this comment is one of frustration or resignation, indicating that the commenter feels their team is unfairly targeted or struggling. Given the context, "The Jets" is clearly referring to the in-group team, which is the Jets, thereby warranting the [IN] tag. Additionally, considering the win probability is relatively low (32.5%), it suggests that the Jets are not performing well, which aligns with the comment's tone of being picked on. Therefore, "The Jets" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, making the tag and referring expressions accurate.	The commenter expresses frustration or disappointment about how the Jets, the in-group team, are targeted negatively. 'The Jets' is tagged [IN] because it refers directly to the in-group team that the commenter supports, indicating that they feel their team is being unfairly treated or singled out.	1665945890.0	jets	packers			1.0	0.32463288307189897	[5]

Hence, the Patriots fans would be unhappy with the game result. 'The crowd' is therefore tagged as [OUT] because it refers to the supporters of the opponent team, and there are no explicit references to the in-group in this comment.	The comment "The crowd is NOT happy lmao" implies that the home team's fans are expressing dissatisfaction. In this context, since the commenter supports the Bengals and the out-group is the Patriots, it's reasonable to infer that the game is likely being played in the Patriots' home stadium. This means that the unhappy crowd is the Patriots' crowd, which should be tagged as [OUT]. Therefore, "The crowd" should be tagged with [OUT], reflecting that they are referring to the opposing team's fans.	1671910274.0	bengals	patriots	thiccbikeboi	 	12.0	0.9852227792143822	[5]

This directly refers to the out-group opponent, the Bills. The commenter does not mention the in-group team, the Lions, but instead focuses on making a statement about the out-group. Given the context, "Bills" clearly refers to the out-group opponent team. Taylor Swift is mentioned to draw a comparison, but she does not belong to either the in-group or the out-group, so "Taylor Swift's personal jet" is not tagged since it doesn't represent any specific team related to the game. Therefore, "Bills" should be tagged [OUT] as it directly refers to the out-group team, while other elements in the sentence don't require tagging. The win probability is relatively low for the in-group, which could imply a lack of focus on their own team and more on the opponent, further justifying the tagging.	The comment directly mentions 'Bills', which refers to the out-group team the commenter is talking about. Since the comment is comparing the 'Bills team plane' to 'Taylor Swift's personal jet', the word 'Bills' is tagged as [OUT]. There are no other entities mentioned in the sentence that would be tagged as in-group or other, making 'Bills' the correct and only referring expression to be tagged.	1669312674.0	lions	bills	Skraxx	CornDoggyLOL	10.0	0.303274512290955	[5]

'they' in the first sentence likely refers to fans of the out-group (Eagles), who are reacting negatively ('salty'). 'our' refers to the subreddit of the in-group (Cowboys), indicating where the commenter belongs. In the second sentence, 'em' refers back to the out-group fans, expressed strongly with 'Fuck em'. Hence, 'they' and 'em' should be tagged [OUT], and 'our' should be tagged [IN].	The first sentence indicates that fans of the out-group team (Eagles) are upset in the subreddit of the in-group team (Cowboys). Thus, 'they' refers to the out-group and should be tagged [OUT], and 'our' refers to the in-group and should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, 'em' is a hostile reference to the out-group, so it should also be tagged [OUT].	1641696514.0	cowboys	eagles	OnTheFenceGuy		4.0	0.9569428116083145	[5, 5, 5]

Considering that fans typically praise players from the team they support, it is reasonable to infer that Billings is a player from the in-group team, the Browns. The high win probability of 78.9% for the in-group further suggests that the team is performing well, and thus, it would be natural for a fan to be praising their own team's players. Therefore, Billings should be tagged [IN], referring to the in-group.	Billings likely refers to Andrew Billings, a defensive tackle for the Cleveland Browns. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Browns (in-group), the phrase is likely directed at praising Billings as part of their own team. Therefore, 'Billings' should be tagged with [IN], marking him as a member of the in-group team.	1634864639.0	browns	broncos	nickyxpants	:joe-cool:	4.0	0.789042115211487	[5]

['bears', 'bucs']	[(63, 68), (107, 111)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]']	The commenter mentions both the Bears and the Bucs, but neither team is the opponent in this game, as the out-group opponent is the Giants. Hence, both 'bears' and 'bucs' should be tagged with [OTHER], since they refer to other teams in the NFL that are not playing in this particular game. The win probability for the Packers is high, indicating they are likely winning the game, but this comment does not directly engage with the current game. Instead, it critiques the quality of previous opponents, which are the Bears and the Bucs. Therefore, the tagged output and referring expressions are correct.	The terms 'bears' and 'bucs' refer to the Chicago Bears and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, respectively. These are teams in the NFL that are not currently involved in the game between the Packers (in-group) and the Giants (out-group). The commenter, a Packers fan, is mentioning these teams to highlight the strength of the schedule or to make a point about the calibre of past opponents. Therefore, 'bears' and 'bucs' are tagged as [OTHER] since they refer to other NFL teams that are neither the commenter-supported Packers nor their current opponent, the Giants.	1665327114.0	packers	giants	Theballharperhit		1.0	0.891588151454926	[5, 5]

Given the high win probability of 96.5%, it suggests that the 49ers are controlling the game, evidenced here by burning the clock, a strategy typically employed by a team that is ahead to ensure victory. Therefore, "Niners" should be tagged with [IN], as it refers to the in-group team.	The term 'Niners' is a common nickname for the San Francisco 49ers, which is identified as the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Niners' should be tagged as [IN] since it explicitly refers to the in-group. The statement suggests a significant control of the game clock, likely a positive remark about the in-group's performance.	1638145358.0	49ers	vikings	Sky_London	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	3.0	0.965291261672974	[5]

[SENT] Good adjustment 	['joe']	[(51, 54)]	['[IN]']	The comment is celebrating a strategic move made during the game, suggesting that the commenter is pleased with in-group team actions or decisions. The first sentence, "Press man on 3rd and 6", speaks generally to a defensive play decision without specifying a team, so it isn't tagged. The second sentence, "Hell yeah joe", expresses excitement and approval directed towards Joe, which is a supportive phrase indicative of in-group reference. Joe is likely a player or coach for the Browns. This excitement likely stems from a successful adjustment mentioned in the third sentence, aligning with the in-group team doing well, as evidenced by the relatively high win probability. Thus, 'joe' is tagged as [IN] in the context of a successful or approved action. The third sentence "Good adjustment" continues to affirm the positive sentiment, but it doesn't directly mention any specific entity, so it isn't tagged.	The comment appears to be praising a player's decision or action in a positive and supportive manner, indicating it is likely about the in-group. The second sentence directly addresses "joe" in an encouraging tone ("Hell yeah"), suggesting that "joe" is a player on the team the commenter supports (the Browns). The third sentence ("Good adjustment") further compliments the decision/action, which, in context, refers back to "joe" and the Browns' performance. Therefore, "joe" should be tagged with [IN], and the rest of the sentences are implicitly about the in-group through their context, requiring no additional explicit tagging.	1664735412.0	browns	falcons	ClevelandOG	:crazy-joe:	8.0	0.646825402975082	[5]

['the refs', 'we']	[(21, 29), (44, 46)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]']	The comment reflects a sentiment of frustration and disappointment. 'the refs' refers to the referees, who are considered neutral and not part of either the in-group or out-group, thus tagged as [OTHER]. The phrase 'we could n't pull it out for you' clearly refers to the in-group (Lions), as the commenter is apologizing for the in-group team not being able to secure a win, reflected in the 0.0% win probability. While the sentiment in the second sentence, 'I wanted it so bad,' is still about the in-group team, it doesn't include explicit references to the team. Therefore, properly tagging 'the refs' as [OTHER] and 'we' as [IN] correctly captures the intended targets in the context of the comment.	The commenter is apologizing and expressing regret over a loss. This indicates that the commenter supports the in-group team, the Lions. The complaint about the referees is a common expression of frustration, and since the refs are a neutral party overseeing the game, they should be tagged as [OTHER]. 'we' refers to the commenter including themselves with the in-group team, the Lions, showing their personal connection and support for that team. So 'we' should be tagged [IN].Therefore, "the refs" should be tagged [OTHER] because they are an impartial entity and not part of either the in-group or out-group, and "we" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group, the Lions.	1673238195.0	lions	packers	rams_man13		8.0	0.0	[5, 5]

Therefore, "Tom" is tagged with [IN]. The phrase "channeled his inner Lamar Jackson" implies that Tom Brady made a play that is characteristic of Lamar Jackson, who is a quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens, another team in the NFL. "Lamar Jackson" should therefore be tagged with [OTHER] since he is not part of the in-group or the out-group. The win probability indicates that the in-group team is doing well, supporting the likelihood that the comment is complimentary towards Tom Brady's performance.	Tom Brady is a player for the Buccaneers, the in-group team, so 'Tom' should be tagged with [IN]. Lamar Jackson is a player for neither the Buccaneers nor the Bills, but he plays for the Ravens, another team in the NFL. Therefore, 'Lamar Jackson' should be tagged with [OTHER].

[SENT] Alright , what 's the over - under on people calling for [IN] to be fired during this game ? 	['Zac']	[(64, 67)]	['[IN]']	The comment is discussing the likelihood of people calling for Zac to be fired. 'Zac' is likely referring to Zac Taylor, who is the head coach of the Bengals. The Bengals are the in-group team the commenter supports. The low win probability of 25.7% indicates that the Bengals are currently losing or not performing well, which might prompt fans to call for the coach's dismissal. Therefore, 'Zac' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the head coach of the in-group team the commenter supports.	The comment references calls for "Zac" to be fired. Zac Taylor is the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals, which is the in-group team supported by the commenter. Fans typically discuss the firing of their own team's coach when they are frustrated with the team's performance. Thus, "Zac" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to someone associated with the in-group team, the Bengals.	1641752639.0	bengals	browns			5.0	0.256752729415894	[5]

The low win probability suggests that the in-group team (Bengals) is currently not favored in the game, so any positive development would be especially notable for them. Since there are no explicit words or phrases identifying a specific team or player, the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group team, hence '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	The commenter expresses excitement about gaining momentum, which implies that they are talking about their supported team, especially since gaining momentum is generally seen as positive. Since the Bengals are the in-group team, the whole sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team. The sentence itself does not contain any explicit mention of any team or player.

The win probability is relatively low, indicating the team might not be performing well, and the commenter is criticizing Trevor Lawrence's performance. Thus 'Trevor' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team.	The commenter is likely referring to Trevor Lawrence, the quarterback for the Jaguars. Since the commenter supports the Jaguars, and Trevor Lawrence is a player on the in-group team, the reference to 'Trevor' should be tagged with [IN]. The comment is criticizing his performance but criticism of specific players is often directed at the in-group since fans hold their own team players to high standards.

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The acronym "LFG" stands for "Let's F***ing Go," which is commonly used by excited fans to cheer for their team. Although there is no explicit mention of the team, the exclamation suggests an implicit reference to the in-group team that the commenter supports, in this case, the Bears. The win probability is relatively low, hinting that any moment of excitement or rallying is significant for the in-group. Consequently, the whole sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as it reflects the commenter's enthusiasm and support for the Bears.	'LFG' is an acronym commonly used in sports contexts meaning 'Let's F***ing Go!' It expresses excitement or enthusiasm, and fans typically use this phrase to cheer for their own team. Given the commenter's support for the Bears (in-group), the excitement is directed at their own team. Even though there is no explicit mention of the Bears, the sentiment indicates support for the in-group team. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to capture the implicit reference to the in-group.	1639363321.0	bears	packers	mesocyclonic4	Deep Dish	1.0	0.32453882694244396	[5]

The win probability is very low, indicating that the in-group team (Commanders) is likely losing. In response to this poor performance, the commenter is mentioning positive performances from other sports teams local to the Washington, D.C. area, such as the Washington Wizards (NBA) and the Washington Capitals (NHL). Despite the different sport, these teams are still considered part of the in-group because they are from the same city/region that the commenter supports. Therefore, 'the wizards' and 'caps' should be tagged [IN] as they are entities associated with the in-group region.	The commenter refers to two other Washington-based sports teams, the Wizards (NBA) and the Capitals (NHL). Fans of the Commanders, a Washington NFL team, are likely to support other local teams. Therefore, 'the wizards' and 'caps' should be tagged with [IN] since they refer to in-group entities as part of the broader Washington sports community.	1635101831.0	commanders	packers	MrsEveryShot	:wizards:	2.0	0.044820416718720946	[5, 5]

The phrase "the line" is also unqualified and is in the context of discussing the team's performance, which implies the defensive line of the in-group team (49ers). The win probability being at 38.3% suggests that the in-group is currently trailing, providing context for the criticism of their defensive performance. Therefore, "the line" and "our secondary" should both be tagged as [IN] because they refer to the in-group team, the 49ers.	The commenter is speaking about performance issues related to their team's defense. The phrase "the line" refers to the defensive line, and "our secondary" refers to the defensive backs. The terms "the line" and "our secondary" are discussed in a manner indicative of the commenter analyzing their own team's weaknesses. Fans typically talk about defensive lines and secondaries of their in-group team in this negative light. So, "the line" and "our secondary" should both be tagged as [IN], which are elements of the in-group team, the 49ers.	1672613615.0	49ers	raiders	Danimaltastic	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	1.0	0.383440369760509	[5, 5]

Teddy Bridgewater is a well-known player for the Broncos, hence 'Teddy Bridgewater' should be tagged as [OUT]. The phrase 'test us downfield' implies that 'us' refers to the team the commenter supports, which is the Eagles, so 'us' should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, 'Gannon' refers to Jonathan Gannon, who is the defensive coordinator for the Eagles, hence 'Gannon' should be tagged as [IN]. 'he' in the phrase 'he can beat the breaks off of mediocre qb play' refers back to Gannon, an Eagles coach, so it should also be tagged as [IN]. The win probability is moderately high for the Eagles, which aligns with the commentary suggesting good performance by their coaching staff (Gannon). Therefore, these tags correctly identify the entities in relation to the in-group and out-group teams.	The comment expresses an opinion about Teddy Bridgewater, a player for the Broncos, and Gannon, a player for the Eagles. In the first sentence, "Teddy Bridgewater" refers to the quarterback for the out-group team (Broncos) and should be tagged as [OUT]. The word "us" refers to the in-group team (Eagles) and therefore should be tagged [IN].In the second sentence, the commenter expresses relief that "Gannon" has performed well, indicating this player is a member of the in-group team (Eagles) and should be tagged [IN]. Similarly, "he" refers back to "Gannon," indicating the same in-group affiliation, and should also be tagged [IN].Thus, "Teddy Bridgewater" is tagged [OUT], "us" tagged [IN], and both "Gannon" and "he" are tagged [IN], aligning with the commenter's team allegiance to the Eagles and their opponent status towards the Broncos.	1636925955.0	eagles	broncos	Forgemasterblaster		2.0	0.6215730607509611	[5, 5, 5, 5]

The commenter appears to be a Titans fan given their concern over the in-group team's performance.   In the first sentence, "defense is playing amazing" and "the offense has really gotta pick it up" are likely remarks about the in-group team (Titans), given that fans are more likely to critically appraise their own team's performance (both good and bad). Therefore, "defense" and "the offense" should be tagged as [IN].- In the second sentence, "Let 's see what the O can muster in the second half" implies a desire to see the in-group team's offense improve, so "the O" should be tagged as [IN].- In the third sentence, "You just hope the Bengals ' O does n't adjust at halftime" refers to the out-group team's offense, and thus "the Bengals ' O" should be tagged as [OUT].- "Houston in Week 18" refers to another team, the Texans, not involved in this specific game, and therefore should be tagged [OTHER].The win probability at 42.2% indicates that it's a close game, contributing to	The commentor is recognizing that it is a good, close game and proceeds to talk about the in-group team's defense and offense. In the first sentence, 'defense' is described positively ('playing amazing'), making it likely that it refers to the in-group, since it's unlikely a fan would describe the opponent's defense in such a positive light. Similarly, 'the offense' also refers to the in-group, expressing the need for improvement ('has really gotta pick it up'), reflecting a common fan sentiment about their own team rather than their opponent. These terms are therefore tagged as [IN].In the second sentence, 'the O' (short for offense) continues the discussion about the in-group team's offense, expressing hopeful anticipation for their performance in the upcoming half. Thus, 'the O' is also tagged as [IN].The third sentence explicitly mentions 'the Bengals ' O', referring clearly to the out-group team, hence it is tagged as [OUT]. This sentence also mentions 'Houston', a different team that performed well in Week 18, providing a point of comparison. Since Houston is neither the in-group nor the out-group team, it is tagged as [OTHER].Overall, properly tagging these entities helps to distinguish the discussion	1642892528.0	titans	bengals	deansredhalo		5.0	0.42231285572052	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

However, the commenter is expressing frustration with the halftime show, which they feel is favoring the opponents (Texans) by talking them up while disparaging their own team (Seahawks). The phrase "our opponents" directly refers to the Texans, who are the out-group in this context, hence it should be tagged [OUT]. The word "us" refers to the commenter's own team, the Seahawks, and is therefore tagged [IN]. So overall, even though the in-group team is doing well and has a high probability of winning, the commenter is upset about the perceived biased commentary during the halftime show.	The commenter is expressing frustration about the halftime show's biased coverage, where 'our opponents' refers to the out-group team and 'us' refers to the in-group team.

Herbert is most likely referring to Justin Herbert, who plays for the Chargers, a team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group in this context. Therefore, "Herbert" should be tagged as [OTHER] since it relates to a player from another team in the NFL that is not involved in this particular game.	The game is between the Lions and Cowboys, so 'Herbert' does not refer to either the in-group or out-group team. Herbert likely refers to Justin Herbert, the quarterback for the Los Angeles Chargers, which is another team in the NFL.

['RODGERS']	[(61, 68)]	['[IN]']	The high level of excitement and cheer in the comment indicates that something very positive has happened for the in-group. '443 !!!!' likely refers to a significant achievement, like Rodgers (a key player for the Packers) breaking a record or making a crucial play. There is no mention of the out-group (Browns), and the usage of 'WOOOOOOOO !!!!' and 'MERRY CHRISTMAS RODGERS !!!' strongly implies celebration directed towards a figure within the in-group, specifically Rodgers. Therefore, 'RODGERS' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a prominent player for the Packers, the team the commenter supports.	The exclamatory and celebratory nature of the comments suggest something positive has happened for the in-group team, the Packers. 'RODGERS' refers to Aaron Rodgers, the quarterback for the Packers, and the context is clearly celebratory towards him, implying he is being congratulated. Thus '[IN]' correctly tags 'RODGERS' since this is complimentary and specific towards a player on the in-group team the commenter supports. The other sentences are expressions of celebration without specific referring expressions.	1640469454.0	packers	browns	justme2176		5.0	0.708885073661804	[5]

[SENT] I see a [OTHER] turn over coming 	['Lions', 'Detroit']	[(7, 12), (64, 71)]	['[OUT]', '[OTHER]']	The comment appears to be made by a Packers fan, in a game against the Lions. The first sentence, "Lions still have fans?", is questioning the fandom of the opposing team, the Lions, and should be tagged as [OUT] since 'Lions' refers to the out-group opponent. The second sentence, "Thats ok.", does not directly refer to any team and should remain untagged. The third sentence, "I see a Detroit turn over coming", initially seems like it's talking about the Lions (since Detroit is the city they are based in), but given the context of a probable turnover and the high win probability for the in-group, it may be expressing some anxiety about the in-group team (Packers) making a mistake. This misreading of intent leads to it being tagged incorrectly here; under an alternative interpretation, "Detroit" refers to the out-group and should be marked [OUT] to match the correct intent inferred about the commenter's thoughts on an opposing team's error.	The commenter's in-group team is the Packers, and the out-group team is the Lions. The first sentence directly mentions "Lions," which refers to the out-group, so it should be tagged as [OUT]. The second sentence, "Thats ok," does not contain an explicit reference to any team, and it is not necessarily linked to either in-group or out-group. The third sentence, however, mentions "Detroit," which is a reference to the city of the out-group team (the Lions). However, in this context, "Detroit" is often colloquially used to refer to the Lions, making it somewhat ambiguous without additional context. Still, given that "Detroit" refers to the same entity (the Lions) in the context of NFL discourse, it should be tagged as [OUT] rather than [OTHER]. Thus, "Lions" and "Detroit" should both be tagged as [OUT].	1641753025.0	packers	lions	Dro0412		8.0	0.809273600578308	[5, 5]

The use of "We" and "we" clearly indicates the in-group team, the 49ers. "LFG" (Let's Fucking Go) is an exclamation of support and excitement, which implies strong enthusiasm for the in-group team, even if not explicitly naming the team. Therefore, "We" and "we" should be tagged with [IN], and "[SENT]" in the second sentence should be tagged as [IN] due to the implicit support for the in-group.	The comment is indicative of a fan's support for their team, boasting about their team's performance in the fourth quarter. The use of the word "we" in "We all know 4th qtr is where we shine" signifies that the commenter is referring to their in-group, the 49ers. The final sentence "LFG" (Let's F***ing Go) is a rallying cry commonly used by fans in support of their team, implying ongoing support and enthusiasm for the in-group. The entire comment positions the 49ers in a positive light, indicating the commenter is talking about their own team.

"Opposing offenses" should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the Lions. The phrase "if we get to third down" implies that the commenter is talking from the perspective of the in-group, hence both instances of "we" should be tagged [IN]. "King" is a player for the Packers, and his name is used in a critical context about his performance, indicating he's part of the in-group. Thus, "King" should also be tagged [IN]. Overall, the comment reflects on the in-group's perceived weaknesses in third down situations, and the tags should denote those references respectively.	'Opposing offenses' refers to the out-group, which is the Lions, since the comment expresses an opposing team's perspective. The 'if we get to third down, we can always rely on' part is a sarcastic comment about an in-group player failing, so 'we' in this context refers to the commenter assuming the perspective of the in-group opponent, which is the Lions, thus both instances of 'we' should be tagged [IN]. 'King' refers to a player on the Packers, the commenter's team, who is being criticized for enabling the opposing team to get first downs.

The use of "WE" indicates that the commenter is talking about their own team in a critical manner, common among fans who are deeply invested in the performance of their team. "WE" is a clear indication that the commenter is referring to the Cowboys as the in-group. Fans often use such language when they discuss strategy and express frustration or confusion over play-calling decisions, even when their team is winning. Thus, 'WE' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The use of 'WE' in this context implies that the commenter is speaking about the team they support — the in-group, which in this case is the Cowboys. Fans typically use 'we' to refer to their own team, expressing frustration or dissatisfaction with the coaching strategy.

This can be inferred since the commenter expresses a desire to see Malik Davis play in a specific position, which is something a fan would say about a player from their own team. Hence, Malik Davis should be tagged as [IN]. In the phrases "I'd honestly love to see him play" and "He was great in preseason," both "him" and "He" clearly refer to Malik Davis, whom we established as a player on the in-group (Cowboys). Therefore, these pronouns should also be tagged as [IN]. Overall, all mentions of Malik Davis and the pronouns referring to him should be tagged [IN] because they indicate a focus on an in-group player.	The commenter is a supporter of the Cowboys and is discussing Malik Davis, who is a player for the Cowboys. Thus, 'Malik Davis' should be tagged [IN] since he is a member of the in-group. When the commenter uses 'him' and 'He', they are referring to Malik Davis, who has already been identified as a member of the in-group. Therefore, 'him' and 'He' should also be tagged with [IN]. The first sentence is about the in-group, implicitly referring to the Cowboys' actions and preferences, so each related noun (Malik Davis, him) is tagged [IN].

Therefore, 'Robby Anderson' should be tagged [IN].	The commenter is asking about Robby Anderson, a player for the Panthers, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Fans typically inquire about the performance or situation of their own players rather than those of the opposing team without additional context.

'D' refers to the defense in this context and is associated with the in-group, so it should be tagged [IN]. The win probability is high (91.8%), suggesting that the in-group Browns are in a position to finish the game strongly, which aligns with the comment aiming to rally the team to finish the game ('Let's finish this!!!'). The second sentence uses 'Let's,' indicating the inclusion of the commenter with the in-group, supporting the team's effort, so the entire sentence is tagged [IN].	The comment is addressing the defense ('D'), urging them to perform better or clinch the win. Using 'Cmon' signifies encouragement typically directed towards the in-group team the commenter supports. 'D' is shorthand for 'defense', which in the context of sports comments, and without explicit qualification, is usually a reference to the in-group. The enthusiasm and rallying call to 'finish this' is also indicative of support for the in-group team, hence the second sentence '[SENT]' tagged as [IN]. 'D' should be tagged with [IN], and the second sentence (expressed as '[SENT]') should be tagged with [IN] since both are implicitly or explicitly referring to the in-group team, the Browns.	1633291868.0	browns	vikings	UnreflectiveEmployee	:browns:	3.0	0.9176649004220963	[5, 5]

Given the win probability is quite high, this indicates the Bills are performing well overall. The use of "uncharacteristic" suggests a rare mistake, and it is common for fans to point out uncharacteristic errors made by their own team's players. Therefore, "bass" refers to an in-group player, and should be tagged with [IN], which is reflected in the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS being correct.	'Bass' refers to Tyler Bass, who is a kicker for the Buffalo Bills. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Bills, any reference to Bass, unless explicitly stated otherwise, would typically be viewed as referring to the in-group team. The criticism or observation ('uncharacteristic') is something fans usually direct towards their own team players. Therefore, 'bass' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	1662685734.0	bills	rams	magnumcush	Takeo Spikes Neck 	3.0	0.804897457361221	[5]

The win probability is at 100.0%, indicating that the Chiefs are certainly winning, which corroborates the praise for a player in such a dominant position. 'BUTKER' is the only explicit word referring to an entity in the comment, and it should be tagged [IN] since Butker is part of the in-group team supported by the commenter. Thus, 'BUTKER' is correctly tagged with [IN].	The commenter is providing a compliment, which is usually directed towards a player on the team they support.

The low win probability (20.0%) indicates that the Ravens are likely performing poorly at this point in the game, and such a comment would be more expected from a fan lamenting their own team's performance rather than the opponent's. Without an explicit mention of the team, the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group team, hence '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]'.	The comment 'Disgraceful performance' lacks any direct reference to a specific player or team, but it is highly likely that the commenter is referring to the in-group team, the Ravens, as fans typically criticize their own team's performance when expressing disappointment in such strong terms. Thus, without an explicit mention of any team or player, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team and should be tagged as [IN], with '[SENT]' being the referring expression.	1632686820.0	ravens	lions	AssertiveDude	 :LLAMA:	1.0	0.199927300214767	[5]

Since the in-group is the Giants, the mention of 'Thibs' refers to an in-group player. The comment describes a physical action happening to Thibodeaux, which is likely happening during the game. Despite the win probability being relatively balanced, the focus is on an in-group player's experience. Hence, 'Thibs' should be tagged [IN]. The rest of the sentence does not explicitly mention any other entities, so there are no more referring expressions to be tagged.	'Thibs' refers to Kayvon Thibodeaux, a player for the New York Giants, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. The comment is about Thibs being held (Bear hugged), which implies frustration or concern for a player from their own team.

The odds referenced in the first sentence are likely the win probabilities, suggesting a battle against the likelihood of winning, which the in-group is facing. The use of "faithful" is a common term used by 49ers fans to refer to themselves. The in-group context is maintained throughout both sentences, thus the entire comment is implicitly about the in-group team. Therefore, the two '[SENT]' tokens should be tagged with '[IN]' since the commenter is consistently referring to the in-group team and rallying support for them implicitly. There are no explicit words referencing the in-group, but the entirety of both sentences is implicitly referring to the in-group, the 49ers.	The enthusiastic and supportive tone of the comment indicates that the commenter is rooting for their in-group team, the 49ers. Phrases like "Let's get this win baby," "let's get hyped," "let's fuck some shit up," and "let's goooooo faithful" suggest a rallying call directed toward the commenter's own team. The use of "faithful" is a well-known reference to the 49ers fanbase, known as the "Niner Faithful." Therefore, both sentences are implicitly referring to the in-group team without explicitly naming them. Thus, both sentences should be tagged as [IN].	1641762758.0	49ers	rams	Asectic08	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	6.0	0.595943093299866	[5, 5]

Since Daniel Jones is a quarterback for the Giants, he is in the out-group, and thus should be tagged [OUT]. The word "us" refers to the commenter's own team, the Packers, so it should be tagged [IN]. The win probability of 64.4% suggests the Packers might be winning, but at the moment, they are struggling against the out-group player's performance. Therefore, "Daniel Jones" should be tagged [OUT] and "us" should be tagged [IN].	"Daniel Jones" is a player for the Giants, the out-group team, so it should be tagged as [OUT].

The mention of 'seattle' is a reference to the Seahawks, as the team is based in Seattle, making 'seattle' also tagged with [IN]. The high win probability suggests that the Seahawks are performing well, aligning with the positive tone of "the beginning of a new dawn" which is being attributed to Pete Carroll and the team. Therefore, both Pete Carroll and seattle should be tagged [IN].	Pete Carroll is the head coach of the Seahawks, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. The reference to 'Pete Carroll' should therefore be tagged as [IN]. The city's name 'seattle' is also a reference to the in-group team, so it should be tagged as [IN] as well.

They consider a call 'generous,' suggesting the call is favorable towards the Jets, creating the sense that they received an advantage. Although the win probability at the time is low, the sentiment reflects on the specific moments or calls rather than the overall game state. Therefore, 'us' should be tagged as [IN] because it represents the in-group team the commenter supports.	The use of 'us' is inclusive language that typically refers to the team the commenter supports, which in this case is the Jets.

The statement is highly critical, calling Canada the "worst OC in the NFL," which suggests frustration with a member of the in-group.

The supporter is expressing a positive opinion about one of their players. Without additional context, 'he' is assumed to refer to a player from the in-group team the commenter supports.

The comment expresses a sentiment about the in-group team getting lucky, thus "We" should be tagged as [IN]. The in-group team is positioned somewhat favorably with a win probability of 59.5%, and the commenter's language implies a positive outcome (getting lucky), which aligns with a relatively high win probability. Therefore, tagging "We" as [IN] correctly reflects the commenter's support for the Raiders and their observation about that team's fortune in the game.	'We' is a pronoun that typically refers to the in-group, as fans commonly use it to represent the team they support. In this context, 'We' refers to the Raiders, the in-group team the commenter supports. The comment suggests that the team the commenter supports got lucky, which indicates that the sentiment is directed at the in-group team.

Given that 'the Steelers' are the out-group and the punter in question is from the out-group team, the reference should be tagged with [OUT]. The win probability for the in-group Browns is relatively high, suggesting they are likely doing well, and the commenter might be commenting on a weaker aspect of the opponent's game. Therefore, 'the Steelers' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team, making the target and referring expressions correct.	The commenter is referring specifically to the Steelers punter and questioning his ability to kick. Since the Steelers are the out-group team in this context, the phrase "the Steelers" should be tagged with [OUT]. Thus, 'the Steelers' is correctly identified as referring to the out-group, and the comment implicitly criticizes the out-group's player's performance, fitting the characterization of an out-group reference.	1635707328.0	browns	steelers	mramsey1992		2.0	0.686495244503021	[5]

Booker and Saquon Glennon are players for the Giants, hence the references to "Booker" and "Saquon Glennon" should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to in-group players. The comment appears to be sarcastically praising the handoffs by Giants' players, which aligns with the lower win probability suggesting that the team is not performing well overall. Therefore, the entities "Booker" and "Saquon Glennon" are correctly tagged as [IN].	The comment mentions Booker and Saquon Glennon, who are players for the Giants, the team the commenter supports (in-group). The criticism or sarcastic praise of 'Glennon's handoffs must be elite' fits within the context of discussing the in-group team and its players. Given this, both 'Booker' and 'Saquon Glennon' should be tagged with [IN], as they refer to the in-group. Thus, the sentence does not refer to the out-group Cowboys or any other team but focuses on the in-group performance. Therefore, 'Booker' and 'Saquon Glennon' correctly tagged with [IN].	1639938671.0	giants	cowboys	HelloItsMeGuyFieri		5.0	0.133173957467079	[5, 5]

The comment expresses a desire to reverse this situation through rituals and such, which implies a strong emotional investment in the in-group team (Jaguars) to turn things around. There is no explicit mention of the Jaguars or any other team in the comment, so the entire sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to reflect this implicit reference to the in-group team the commenter supports.

Given the very high win probability for the in-group team, it's likely that the team is winning comfortably, and the commenter wants them to take more risks. The term 'offense' is mentioned without qualification, indicating it's the in-group team's offense being referred to. Hence, 'offense' should be tagged as [IN]. There are no other explicit references to other entities, so no other tags are necessary.	The comment critiques the offensive strategy of the in-group team. The complaint about conservative play implies familiarity and investment, indicative of a fan of the in-group.

Despite the moderate win probability for the Patriots, the focus is on specific in-group issues. 'this offense' refers to the Patriots' offense, so it should be tagged [IN]. 'Mac' and 'Patricia' are likely referring to Mac Jones (the Patriots' quarterback) and Matt Patricia (a coach for the Patriots), respectively, thus both should also be tagged [IN]. The sentiment of the entire comment is directed towards the in-group, highlighting frustrations with their performance and coaching decisions.	The comment is clearly expressing frustration with the in-group team's performance. The phrase "this offense" is likely referring to the in-group Patriots, given the negative tone. Similarly, the statement "It isn't on Mac" is likely absolving Mac Jones, a player for the Patriots, thus "Mac" should be tagged [IN]. The frustration is then directed towards the play-calling by "Patricia," referring to Matt Patricia, a coach for the Patriots, so "Patricia" should also be tagged as [IN].

In the first sentence, 'We' refers to Raiders fans including the commenter, thus tagged as [IN]. 'Carr' is the Raiders' quarterback, and hence, tagged as [IN] in all instances. 'Herbert' is the quarterback for the Chargers, the opponent team, so he is tagged as [OUT]. In the third sentence, 'Carr' is again tagged as [IN]. In the fourth sentence, 'him' refers to Carr, who is an in-group player, so it is tagged as [IN]. 'the raiders' is explicitly mentioned and tagged as [IN] since it is the in-group team. In the final sentence, 'he' refers back to Carr, tagged as [IN]. The implicit reference to the team using 'us' and 'win one' are also tagged as [IN] as they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter is discussing players and the team they support (Raiders) versus the opposing team (Chargers), and their preferences around key players. 'We' refers to the in-group (Raiders) since it denotes the people within the commenter's supportive community. 'Carr' is the Raiders' quarterback, so any mention of Carr should be tagged with [IN]. 'Herbert' is the quarterback for the Chargers, thus he should be tagged with [OUT]. The phrases 'him' and 'he' refer to 'Carr', who is part of the in-group, thus they should be tagged with [IN]. 'the raiders' is explicitly the commenter's team, making it [IN]. The second sentence does not have explicit references to players or teams, so it remains untagged.

The phrase "this team" refers to the team in question, which is the Giants, as the context suggests dissatisfaction with their current performance. Fans often use "this team" to talk about their own team, especially when expressing negative sentiments. Thus, "this team" is correctly tagged as [IN], referring to the in-group.	The commenter is likely expressing frustration and disbelief about the performance of the in-group team they support, which is the Giants. The phrase 'this team' is used without any qualification, strongly indicating that it refers to the in-group. Fans typically criticize their own team in such a manner.

['Kieft']	[(24, 29)]	['[IN]']	The name 'Kieft' refers to Ko Kieft, a player for the Buccaneers, which is the in-group in this context. The comment, despite its sarcastic tone, is referring to an in-group player's performance on a specific play, thereby warranting the [IN] tag. The overall negative tone of the comment is toward an in-group play that resulted in zero yards, and does not refer to the out-group team. Hence, 'Kieft' should be tagged with [IN] and no references to the out-group or other teams are present.	The commenter expresses enjoyment at seeing the player, Kieft, who is part of the in-group team (Buccaneers), forge ahead power blocking, despite it resulting in a 0 yard run. The use of the possessive tone ("love seeing") implies familiarity and support, indicative of an in-group reference.

test	ruf6qy	hqytt64	t3_ruf6qy	[SENT] That 's fucking grounding 	[OUT] That 's fucking grounding 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	In American football, "grounding" is a penalty called on the offense, specifically the quarterback, for intentionally throwing a pass to avoid a sack without a receiver in the area. Given that the win probability for the in-group (Titans) is relatively high, it's likely the commenter is frustrated with the out-group (Dolphins) quarterback not being penalized for intentional grounding. Since the comment implies frustration directed at the opponent, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]', referring to the out-group team without explicitly mentioning them. Thus, 'That's fucking grounding' is referring to an action by the opponent team and should be tagged accordingly.	The comment 'That's fucking grounding' is likely referring to a penalty call on the out-group team. Commenters often express frustration or anger regarding penalties committed by the opponent. Since there are no specific words tagged in the sentence, and it contains no specific players or team names but criticism towards a play/action, the entire sentence is tagged with [OUT] to indicate the comment is directed towards the out-group.	1641149853.0	titans	dolphins	shlooged-	:SadPepe:	4.0	0.825187861919403	[5]

However, the comment appears to express concern or critique about a specific in-group player, Tre. This commonly happens in sports discussions, where fans focus on individual performances despite the team's overall strong performance. 'Tre' is mentioned without any additional context suggesting he's from the out-group, so he is likely a player from the 49ers. Given the structure of the comment and the common practice of referring to players from the team one supports by first name or nickname, 'Tre' should be tagged as [IN], indicating that Tre is part of the in-group.Therefore, 'Tre' is tagged as [IN], as it refers to an in-group player from the 49ers, properly accounting for the concern or critique expressed towards him within the context of the game.	The comment refers to "Tre," likely shorthand for Trey Lance, who is a player for the 49ers. Since the commenter supports the 49ers, "Tre" should be tagged as [IN]. The comment indicates concern for an in-group player's position, which is consistent with a fan talking about someone from their own team.

However, given the context that fans often respect good plays or sportsmanship from the opposing team in such a close game (as evidenced by the win probability being almost evenly split), it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is showing respect for an action taken by the out-group opponent (Ravens). Thus, the sentence should be tagged [OUT], and since there is no explicit referring expression for the out-group in the comment, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged.	The commenter is giving respect, which usually implies they are acknowledging a good play or sportsmanship by the opposing team, as fans typically show admiration reluctantly for a rival. Given the in-group is the Steelers and the out-group is the Ravens, the comment is likely intended to praise the out-group. Thus the entire sentence should be tagged with [OUT] since there is no explicit word or phrase that refers to the out-group, but the comment is implicitly referring to the respect-worthy action of the opponent.	1641753857.0	steelers	ravens	Renato_Avalos	:sc::c2::c2::sc: Najee Harris	1.0	0.523501574993133	[5]

['fumbly Hasty', 'we']	[(27, 39), (51, 53)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter expresses a preference for "fumbly Hasty" over another player, suggesting both are on the in-group team they support (49ers). "fumbly Hasty" is tagged [IN] since the commenter is comparing him to another in-group player. The "we" refers to the 49ers who signed a player off the street, so it is also tagged [IN]. The win probability is extremely high, indicating that the 49ers are likely winning the game, which supports the context that the comment is focusing on the team's internal comparisons rather than the out-group.	The comment is comparing two players, one of whom is characterized negatively ('fumbly Hasty') but is still preferred over an even less familiar or less trusted option ('a guy we signed off the street this week'). The use of 'we' indicates the in-group, as the commenter refers to actions taken by their own team (the 49ers, in this case). The reference to the player 'Hasty' is also associated with the in-group since the commenter is discussing their own team's players.Thus, 'fumbly Hasty' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a player on the in-group team (49ers). The word 'we' should also be tagged as [IN] since it clearly denotes the in-group team (49ers).

The win probability is very high, indicating the Rams are likely winning or are in a very advantageous position. "got bailed the fuck out" suggests relief and a positive turn of events for the Rams, aligning with the high win probability. Therefore, "We" should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, and there are no other referring expressions needing tags in this sentence.	'We' in the comment typically refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. Since the in-group is identified as the Rams, 'we' should be tagged as [IN] because the commenter is expressing relief for their own team getting bailed out, which indicates a favorably biased sentiment towards the in-group team.

The commenter appears to be expressing excitement or admiration for a play made by this player, despite the low win probability for the Jaguars, indicating they appreciate a good moment even if the overall game is not favorable. The phrase "brought the boom stick" is a positive comment about Robinson's performance, and since 'JRob' is a short form often used affectionately or informally by fans when talking about their team's player, it should be tagged [IN].	The commenter mentioned 'JRob', which is a nickname for James Robinson, a player for the Jacksonville Jaguars, the in-group for this commenter.

Since these critiques are expressed without any qualifications or additional team identifiers, it suggests that the commenter is referring to the in-group team, the Chiefs. This inference is further supported by the low win probability of the Chiefs, which aligns with a negative outlook toward their performance. The second and third sentences explain the narrative of the game, attributing the poor performance to the Chiefs' defensive line and Kelce's fumble. Therefore, the terms "Defensive line," "Kelce," and "D line" should be tagged as [IN] because they refer to the in-group team, the Chiefs, and the comment's tone aligns with typical fan behavior of criticizing their team when underperforming.The "Defensive line" is mentioned without any additional context, implying it is the in-group (Chiefs) that the commenter supports and critiques. Given the negative win probability, it makes sense the commenter is speaking negatively about their own team's performance. The term "Kelce" refers to a well-known player in the Chiefs, further showing that the comment is critiquing the in-group. The phrase "D line" similarly refers back	The comment is discussing the negative performance of the defensive line and a specific fumble by Travis Kelce, which indicates the commenter is likely frustrated with the in-group team. 'Defensive line' and 'D line' refer to the in-group team (Chiefs) as it is talking about their poor performance without any qualifying statement indicating it refers to an opponent's defensive line. Similarly, 'Kelce' is a well-known player for the Chiefs, indicating the fumble being discussed is related to the in-group player. Therefore, 'Defensive line', 'Kelce', and 'D line' are tagged [IN], and sentences without explicit references are not tagged since they discuss topics already contextualized by the other sentences.	1670199134.0	chiefs	bengals	chitphased	Creed Humphrey #52	5.0	0.16941791772842396	[5, 5, 5]

The win probability is relatively low, indicating that the in-group (Raiders) might be struggling at this point in the game, which is why the commenter is urging them to get a first down. The use of 'Raiders' without any qualifiers also strongly suggests it refers to the team the commenter supports. Hence, 'Raiders' is tagged [IN], while the other segments are not tagged as they are general expressions related to the game action rather than specific entities.	The commenter is showing strong support and a sense of urgency for the Raiders to get a first down, which indicates that 'Raiders' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.

The win probability is not very high, implying the in-group team is not performing well overall, but the commenter is expressing specific appreciation for their team's defense despite the current situation. Therefore, "our defense" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Bengals.	The commenter uses the possessive "our" to express affection for "defense," implying a connection to the in-group team. Since the commenter supports the Bengals, "our defense" refers to the Bengals' defense.

"KC" is referring to the in-group team, the Chiefs, thereby warranting the [IN] tag.	'KC' is a common abbreviation for Kansas City, which is the home city of the Chiefs, the in-group team. The commenter is remarking that the Chiefs frequently get officiated by a particular crew, suggesting a negative or familiar sentiment typical of a fan observing patterns about their own team.

The commenter is emphasizing the presence or performance of their supported team. 'MIAMI' refers to the city in which the Dolphins play and 'THE DOLPHINS' directly refers to the team. Since both 'MIAMI' and 'THE DOLPHINS' refer to the in-group team, they should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is likely celebrating or acknowledging their own team, the Dolphins. 'MIAMI' and 'THE DOLPHINS' both refer to the in-group team. As a fan or supporter, they are reinforcing their association and pride in their team with capital letters.

However, the comment "What a play!" expresses excitement and admiration, which is likely directed towards a good play made by the in-group team (the Chargers). Since there is no explicit mention of the in-group, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] to capture the implicit reference to the in-group team.	The comment 'What a play!' is expressing admiration for a great play. Since the commenter supports the Chargers, it is reasonable to infer that this admiration is directed towards the in-group team, especially in the absence of any explicit reference to a specific team or player.

Xavien Howard is a player for the Dolphins, the out-group team, so his name should be tagged [OUT]. DJ and Cam are referred to multiple times, and since the commenter is pointing out mistakes ('Not a good pass by cam,' and 'DJ fucked cam with the route'), it indicates that these players are from the in-group, the Panthers, as fans often criticize their own players more harshly. DJ gets tagged [IN] and Cam also gets tagged [IN] because they are members of the Panthers, the team that the commenter supports. The phrase 'just owned DJ' implies that DJ was outperformed by someone from the opponent team, which aligns with Xavien Howard being from the Dolphins. Hence, the referring expressions 'Xavien Howard,' 'DJ,' and 'cam' (second sentence), 'DJ,' and 'cam' (again) are correctly tagged with [OUT] and [IN] respectively.	'Xavien Howard' refers to a player on the out-group team (Dolphins), so it should be tagged [OUT]. The commenter blames 'DJ' and 'cam', who are players on the in-group team (Panthers), for not performing well, thus they should be tagged with [IN] both times they are mentioned.

Given the very low win probability of 7.3%, the commenter expresses frustration over their team's poor performance by stating that "Madden is the only place I can force the Saints to win." The context implies that the commenter cannot see a victory for the Saints happening in real life, reinforcing that "the Saints" refers to the in-group team. Thus, "the Saints" should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to the team the commenter supports.	The commenter expresses frustration about not being able to make the Saints win in reality, suggesting that they support the Saints and can only ensure their victory in a video game like Madden. Therefore, 'the Saints' should be tagged with [IN] as they are the in-group team the commenter supports.	1668371737.0	saints	steelers	lsmucker		2.0	0.07346762716770205	[5]

['AB']	[(7, 9)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is referring to AB, also known as Antonio Brown, who is a player for the Buccaneers. The win probability for the Buccaneers is relatively low, indicating they might be struggling, which could explain bringing up AB's mental state in a critical context. Since AB is a member of the in-group team, Buccaneers, "AB" should be tagged as [IN]. There are no other explicit references in the sentence, so only "AB" needs to be tagged accordingly.	The comment is specifically about Antonio Brown (abbreviated AB), a player for the Buccaneers, which is the in-group team for the commenter. The reference to 'AB' does not require any qualifying negative sentiment toward the opposition, indicating it is about their own team's player. Therefore, 'AB' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	1641154513.0	buccaneers	jets	SillyRecover		6.0	0.356110215187073	[5]

This broadcast is not specific to either the Cowboys or the Buccaneers, and Peyton Manning is not associated with either team. However, the high win probability suggests that the commenter is feeling positive, potentially making a light-hearted observation about the game. Given the context, the sentence "Peyton stood up for that one on Manningcast lol" does not directly refer to the Cowboys or Buccaneers, but implicitly implies a positive context for the in-group team (Cowboys) because the commenter is likely attributing the reaction to a favorable play by the Cowboys. Hence, it is reasonable to tag the whole sentence as [IN], even though there is no explicit mention, because the context is reflecting a positive moment for the team the commenter supports.	The sentence "Peyton stood up for that one on Manningcast lol" refers to Peyton Manning, who is a former NFL player and currently a sports commentator. Although Peyton Manning is not directly related to the in-group (Cowboys) or out-group (Buccaneers), the phrase "stood up for that one" suggests an action or play significant enough for him to react, implying something positive about the Cowboys. The '[SENT]' being tagged as [IN] indicates that the comment implicitly refers to a positive moment for the in-group team (Cowboys). Therefore, the sentence itself is marked as referring to the in-group even though Peyton Manning is a neutral entity.	1673921333.0	cowboys	buccaneers	SlammingPussy420	Tony Romo	1.0	0.890017164540277	[5]

There is no direct reference to either the in-group or the out-group team.In the second sentence, the commenter expresses frustration about the officiating favoring Dallas. 'Dallas' refers to the Cowboys, which is the out-group team. The commenter is likely a Chiefs fan, as indicated by the in-group tag, and is frustrated that the referees' decisions seem to benefit their opponents. Therefore, 'going' implies favoritism towards Dallas, which is the out-group team.Thus, the entire sentence "Kind of getting sick of all these calls going Dallas way." should be tagged with Dallas under the out-group label. Consequently, the word 'going' is the referring expression that indicates favoritism towards the Cowboys, which are the out-group team.The first sentence does not mention any specific team and is a general observation, hence it doesn't need any tags. The second sentence is about unfavorable referee decisions that favor 'Dallas'. 'Dallas' refers to the Cowboys, the out-group team. Hence, 'going' in 'calls going Dallas way' implies that calls are favoring the out-group team, making it the referring expression tagged with [	In the comment, the second sentence expresses frustration with the calls favoring one team. Given the in-group is the Chiefs and the out-group is the Cowboys, it is logical that the commenter is upset with calls favoring the Cowboys. The phrase "going Dallas way" is directed at the out-group, indicating that the calls are benefiting the Cowboys. Therefore, 'going' in "all these calls going Dallas way" should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to benefiting the out-group team.	1637533871.0	chiefs	cowboys	Repulsive-Photo-798		2.0	0.910130582749844	[5]

Thus, 'Pacheco' should be tagged with [IN]. The phrase 'that guy' is used to reference the person who caused Pacheco to land weirdly, and considering it implies a negative action, it is likely referring to an opposing player, which is the out-group team, the 49ers. Therefore, 'that guy' should be tagged with [OUT]. Despite the high win probability for the Chiefs, the comment focuses on an immediate incident, expressing concern for the in-group player's welfare and denouncing the out-group player's actions.	The commenter mentions "Pacheco," who is a player for the Chiefs, the in-group team, so "Pacheco" should be tagged as [IN]. The phrase "that guy" likely refers to an opposing player from the out-group team, the 49ers, who is responsible for the action leading to Pacheco landing weirdly. The commenter calls for "that guy" to be ejected, indicating it is someone from the out-group disrupting the in-group.

Although the win probability is low, indicating that the team is currently losing or struggling, fans often use rallying cries to motivate or show support for their team despite the current situation. Hence, 'Bolt up' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group, the Chargers.	The phrase "Bolt up" is a well-known rallying cry or slogan associated with Chargers fans, indicating support for their team.

The word "them" in this context is used to refer to the entity responsible for the actions causing the commenter's frustration. Given that the in-group is the Bengals and the out-group is the Steelers, and considering the hostility evident in the sentence, it is reasonable to assume that "them" refers to the out-group (Steelers). The commenter is likely frustrated with repeated instances of rough play by the Steelers, hence why "them" should be tagged [OUT]. The win probability for the in-group is relatively low at 39.2%, indicating that the Bengals are not in a favorable position, which could contribute to the heightened emotion in the comment.Thus, the word "them" should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to the Steelers, the out-group opponent.	The strong emotional response ("I hate them soo much") indicates that the commenter is talking about the out-group, especially with a negative connotation. The lack of specificity in "them" without additional context implies it refers to the out-group directly without needing further clarification. Thus, "them" should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the Steelers, the team the commenter clearly expresses disdain for.	1662919344.0	bengals	steelers	ask0009		12.0	0.391787320375443	[5]

Given that the comment is sarcastic, indicated by the exclamation "Wow" and the phrase "right guys," it suggests frustration or disbelief, possibly implying a poor performance despite the high win probability. Fans often call out their own team's coaching staff sarcastically when criticizing game decisions or performance, thereby associating "Canada" with the in-group. Thus, "Canada" is tagged [IN] as it refers to a staff member of the Steelers, the team the commenter supports.	'Canada' refers to Matt Canada, who is the offensive coordinator for the Steelers. The sarcastic tone ('right guys') implies the commenter is referring to their own team's staff, often in a disparaging way when things are not going well.

['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (18, 24)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]']	The comment "Too true" and "Makes me really pissed" do not explicitly mention the in-group or out-group team. The win probability is balanced, suggesting a close contest in which the commenter is frustrated by the current situation, but without specific entities mentioned, it is difficult to assign these sentences to the in-group or out-group. Therefore, both sentences are tagged as [OTHER] since there is no clear reference to the Commanders (in-group) or Washington (out-group), and it is ambiguous in terms of team allegiance. The referring expressions '[SENT]', '[SENT]' capture this absence of explicit team references, supporting the tagging of both sentences as [OTHER].	The comment contains no explicit references to any specific team or player. Since the targeted game is between the Commanders (in-group) and Washington (out-group), the general expressions 'Too true' and 'Makes me really pissed' cannot be directly associated with either team. Instead, they reflect sentiments that could be related to any game-related incident involving any team, making it reasonable to tag both '[SENT]' tokens as [OTHER]. This categorization acknowledges the lack of direct, identifiable reference to the in-group or out-group in the comment.	1631841805.0	commanders	washington	TheOtterWon		3.0	0.494379460811615	[5, 5]

However, the second sentence, 'They are saying "hope he's ok" and stuff like that' uses 'They' to refer to a group of people making comments or statements. Based on the context, it's reasonable to assume that 'They' refers to the Bills (the out-group), who are making comments about hoping a player is okay. The win probability of 59.3% indicates that the Ravens (in-group) are likely doing well, which might explain why the commenter is focusing on reactions from the opposing team's supporters. Therefore, 'They' should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to people associated with the out-group (Bills).	The comment implies that the information or sentiment being discussed comes from a group other than the one the commenter supports. The phrase "They are saying" suggests that the commenter is observing remarks made by supporters or affiliates of the opposing team. Since the in-group team is the Ravens and the out-group team is the Bills, 'They' should be tagged with [OUT] as it refers to the out-group (Bills) making comments about a player being okay. The first sentence does not explicitly refer to any group, so it isn't tagged. The second sentence is implicitly about the out-group since "They" are expressed without qualification as the out-group making those comments.	1664739882.0	ravens	bills	MrKingC0bra	 :MD:	2.0	0.593248069286346	[5]

Given the low win probability for the in-group Steelers, the commenter is likely trying to rally and motivate their team despite their current disadvantage. This type of exclamation is almost always made in support of the in-group, evidenced here by the lack of explicit qualification and the context of giving encouragement. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN], with '[SENT]' as the referring expression since there are no specific words or phrases referring explicitly to the team but implicitly indicating support for the Steelers.	This phrase "HERE WE GO" is likely an expression of encouragement or excitement usually aimed at rallying or supporting a team. Given that the commenter is a supporter of the Steelers, the phrase is intended to motivate or show excitement for the in-group team, even though no specific words or phrases explicitly mention the Steelers.

[SENT] I was thinking about applying for [IN] 's job . [SENT] I have absolutely no experience so ca n't be any worse . 	['Zac']	[(41, 44)]	['[IN]']	The comment refers to Zac, who is likely Zac Taylor, the head coach of the Bengals, given the context and common knowledge of NFL teams. The commenter is humorously suggesting they could do Zac's job despite having no experience, implicitly criticizing Zac Taylor's performance. The win probability for the Bengals is relatively low, aligning with the critical tone. Since Zac Taylor is associated with the in-group team (Bengals), 'Zac' should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence is a follow-up on the first and does not introduce any new entities to tag, thus no new referring expressions are needed.	The comment expresses a desire to apply for the job of someone named Zac, likely criticizing the current performance. Zac Taylor is the head coach of the Bengals, and critique or satire about needing to apply for his job implies the commenter is a fan of the in-group team being disappointed with their own team's performance. Thus, 'Zac' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team's coach. The rest of the sentences do not explicitly mention any team but continue the critical tone initiated by the reference to Zac, making the tagging consistent.	1663536484.0	bengals	cowboys	porkopolis		1.0	0.43229913711547796	[5]

Given the context, "burrow" is tagged [IN] because it refers to an in-group player, thereby making the target and referring expressions correct.	'Burrow' refers to Joe Burrow, the quarterback for the Bengals. Since the commenter supports the Bengals, any reference to Burrow is referring to an in-group entity.

This type of criticism would most likely come from a supporter discussing their own team, in this case, the 49ers. Hence, 'He' refers to a player on the in-group team. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to an in-group player who made an unsuccessful play.	The comment criticizes a player who failed to make a play ("dove and whiffed"), which is likely directed toward the in-group team, especially since there's no elaboration or distinguishing comment that points to the out-group. Without additional context, it is reasonable to assume criticism directly without qualifiers is aimed at the in-group. Therefore, "He" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player of the 49ers, the in-group team.	1673221611.0	49ers	cardinals	Vectors2_Final	:jerseyaway52: Patrick Willis	1.0	0.999139934428968	[5]

The win probability is high for the Chiefs at 83.1%, indicating they are likely doing well at this point in the game. The third sentence contains a question about a play involving a lateral pass to "kelce." Kelce refers to Travis Kelce, a well-known tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, making "kelce" an in-group reference. The pronoun "he" in the same sentence most likely refers to another player from the Chiefs who attempted the lateral pass, fitting within the in-group context because a fan is reflecting on a play that their team executed. Therefore, both "he" and "kelce" should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to players on the commenter's supported team, the Chiefs. The first two sentences don't have explicit references to the in-group, out-group, or other teams, and are more about the commenter's reaction, thus they remain untagged.	The comment is referring to a play involving an attempt to lateral the ball to Kelce. Since the commenter supports the Chiefs, and Kelce is a well-known player for the Chiefs, Kelce should be tagged [IN]. Additionally, 'he' refers to the player attempting the lateral, which, given the context, is presumed to be a Chiefs player since the commenter is discussing this attempt within the context of the team they support. Thus, 'he' should also be tagged [IN].	1636946801.0	chiefs	raiders	Phoenician_Douche		1.0	0.831440433859825	[5, 5]

The win probability for the in-group (Seahawks) is low, indicating they are likely struggling in the game. Phrases in such a critical context typically refer to the in-group because fans are more likely to criticize their own team's performance. The term "Defense" is unqualified, suggesting the commenter is talking about their own team's defense. Therefore, "Defense" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter is likely referring to the in-group team, the Seahawks, as they are expressing frustration about the inability to stop various plays ('run' and 'screen') and criticizing 'Defense'. This critique is usually aimed at the in-group team the commenter supports since fans typically express such strong negative sentiments about their own team's performance.

The use of an insult ('retard') and expletives ('fucking flex') indicate frustration or criticism of Feliciano, which is something fans typically express towards their own team's players rather than opponents, especially when their team is in a winning position (60.9% win probability). Therefore, 'feliciano' should be tagged as [IN] because he is a member of the in-group team, and 'his' should also be tagged as [IN] since it refers back to Feliciano.	The comment expresses frustration or disappointment, likely directed toward someone on the in-group team, which is the Giants in this case. Feliciano is a player for the Giants, hence he should be tagged as [IN]. Additionally, 'his' refers to Feliciano, an in-group player. Therefore, both 'feliciano' and 'his' should be tagged with [IN]. The negative tone suggests the commenter is displeased with a particular action by Feliciano, reinforcing the reference to the in-group team.	1670186654.0	giants	washington	Boredealis99		5.0	0.609285751341618	[5, 5]

The first two sentences provide statistics about the Eagles' rushing yards, including and excluding the quarterback Hurts, an Eagles player, so 'The Eagles' and both instances of 'Hurts' should be tagged as referring to [OUT]. The third sentence provides a statistic about the Falcons' (in-group) rushing yards, so 'We' should be tagged as referring to [IN]. The fourth sentence continues to discuss the current state of the Falcons, including their point deficit and strategy considerations, so both instances of 'We' and 'we' in it should be tagged as [IN]. The final sentence reassures that the run game is not non-existent, which is a continuation of discussing the in-group's situation, but without any explicit entity, so it remains untagged. The win probability being low aligns with the mention of the team being down 16 points. Thus, the tags correctly capture who is being referred to in each sentence.	The references to 'the Eagles' and 'Hurts' clearly denote the out-group team (Eagles), thus they are tagged [OUT]. 'We' in sentences 3, 4 (twice), and 5 refers to the in-group team (Falcons) because the commenter is discussing the performance of their own team (100 rushing yards, down 16 points, and the strategy of running the ball). This use of 'we' and 'our' is typical for fans discussing their in-group team. Therefore, 'We', 'We', and 'we' are correctly tagged as [IN]. The sentence describing the Eagles' performance is implicitly referring to the out-group, and the sentence discussing rushing yards is implicitly referring to the in-group without explicitly mentioning either team. This explains why these sentences are tagged based on context.	1631475744.0	falcons	eagles	OhItsKillua		1.0	0.032678846269846	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

['the Pats D']	[(11, 21)]	['[IN]']	The phrase "the Pats D" refers to the Patriots' defense, indicating that the commenter is referring to the in-group, which is the Patriots. This is consistent with the context that fans often discuss their own team's players or units in a fantasy football context, underscoring their support. Hence, "the Pats D" should be tagged with [IN] because it explicitly denotes the in-group.	The commenter is discussing their fantasy football team and mentions 'the Pats D', which refers to the defense of the Patriots. Since the Patriots are the in-group team that the commenter supports, 'the Pats D' should be tagged with [IN]. The sentence '[SENT] Has [IN] on fantasy .' reflects this tagging accurately.	1668972794.0	patriots	jets	Danwarr	War Daddy Deluxe	1.0	0.521560430526733	[5]

The comment is critical of the defense not stepping up, which a fan would direct towards their own team. Therefore, 'They' in these sentences should be tagged [IN]. The third and fourth sentences provide general suggestions for the team to generate pressure and adjust their playing strategy, which are implicitly directed towards the in-group team's defense, so the [SENT] tags should be marked as [IN] here as well.In the fifth sentence, 'The offense' explicitly refers to a part of the in-group team, and thus it should be tagged [IN]. The second instance of 'they' in this sentence also refers back to 'The offense' and should be tagged [IN]. Overall, the entire comment is a critique of the in-group team (49ers) and providing suggestions for improvement, despite the relatively high win probability.	The comment is expressing frustration with a team's performance and coaching, which suggests the commenter is critical of their own team, the 49ers, rather than the opponent, the Seahawks. Here's why:1. The first two sentences mention "They", which is ambiguous on its own but clearly critiquing a group for underperforming and needing to step up. Given the overall context of complaint and the absence of any clear shift to discussing an opponent, it's reasonable to infer "They" refers to the in-group, the 49ers. 2. The third and fourth sentences provide specific instructions (e.g., "Generate some pressure", "Stop playing 5-6 yards off"), suggesting tactical advice to the team the commenter supports, which is common among fans discussing their own team's shortcomings.3. The final sentence criticizes "The offense" for not closing out drives better, referring again to the in-group's (49ers') offensive unit based on the context of complaint without any explicit mention of the Seahawks. 4. The word "they" in the final sentence continues the trend of the previous sentences, keeping the subject focused on the team the commenter supports, attributing the performance issues to the 49ers. Thus, it is	1673735892.0	49ers	seahawks	Nachtvogle		1.0	0.744921445846558	[5, 5, 5, 5]

The use of 'We' without any qualifying information generally indicates in-group, given it reflects a commonly used pronoun by fans to refer to their own team. This is supported by the context of the comment, which discusses a play involving the in-group's ability to catch the ball, and given the low win probability, it suggests the team is struggling, adding to the likelihood that the commenter's focus is on the in-group. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged [IN].	The use of "We" indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, which in this case is the Jets. Fans typically use "we" to refer to their team. The statement suggests disappointment in their own team's inability to catch a throw. Thus, "We" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1662917772.0	jets	ravens	USAJourneyman		4.0	0.168618977069855	[5]

Given that the Ravens have a low win probability of 16.9%, it indicates they are not performing well, and the commenter's frustration with a key individual (presumably someone making important decisions or plays) is evident. This sort of complaint is typical of fans commenting on their own team's performance, making "he" a reference to the in-group. Thus, 'he' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an individual on the in-group team, the Ravens.	The comment is addressing someone who is observed to ignore something visibly clear, often indicative of frustration or criticism. Such frustration or criticism without additional context implies it is directed towards the in-group, especially given no clarification that the subject belongs to the out-group. In this context, 'he' likely refers to a coach, player, or official of the in-group team (Ravens). Therefore, 'he' should be tagged with [IN], as it implicitly refers to someone aligned with the in-group.	1636690026.0	ravens	dolphins	Draconic_Rising	 :SHLD:	1.0	0.16865640878677401	[5]

NFL referees officiate the games but are not tied to any specific team, and thus they fall under the 'OTHER' category. Consequently, 'These refs' and 'you' should be tagged as [OTHER] because they refer to the referees, which are neither the Giants nor the Lions. The in-group win probability is relatively low at 41.0%, indicating the Giants might be struggling, which might have led to frustrations directed towards the officiating, but the target of the comment remains the referees, not the actual teams playing.	The comment expresses frustration towards the referees, who are external to the game between the Giants and the Lions. 'These refs' and 'you' refer to the referees, which are not part of either the in-group or out-group teams but are part of the game enforcement, hence they should be tagged with [OTHER]. The negative sentiment suggests the referees' actions are perceived as unfair, but this perception is not indicative of bias towards or against the in-group or out-group teams.	1668971057.0	giants	lions	coffeeblack85		6.0	0.409891486167908	[5, 4]

The in-group team here is the Bills. The high win probability for the Bills suggests they are in a strong position, but the commenter is still critical of Dorsey's decision-making. Fans often comment on their own team's choices, especially when they question strategy or play-calling. Thus, "Dorsey" is referring to the in-group team, the Bills, making it appropriate to tag "Dorsey" with [IN]. The rest of the sentence does not contain any specific references to individual entities but is implicitly about the in-group's decision-making, reflecting the sentiment of a fan analyzing their own team's actions. Therefore, "Dorsey" should be tagged as [IN] in the context of this comment.	Ken Dorsey is the offensive coordinator for the Bills. When the commenter expresses frustration with what "Dorsey was thinking", it implies criticism directed towards an in-group member (Bills). Thus, 'Dorsey' should be tagged [IN] since he is part of the in-group.	1664127206.0	bills	dolphins	taco_weeb	:block-B::block-I::block-L::block-L::block-S:	5.0	0.727021545171738	[5]

'Rams fans' and 'the Rams' refer to the in-group team in multiple contexts (fandom presence and misconceptions about the fanbase), thus these phrases should be tagged [IN]. The phrase 'the team' in the first sentence, given the context of 'Rams fans' showing up more than 'the team', also refers to the Rams, hence it should be tagged [IN].The commenter references the 'Cowboys' and '49ers' multiple times, but they are not participating in the current game; instead, they are mentioned for comparison purposes about fan dominance in Los Angeles (where the Rams are based). Hence, 'the Cowboys' and '49ers' should be tagged [OTHER] throughout the comment, as they refer to other teams in the NFL that are not the opponents in this specific game (Cardinals).Thus, the correct target tags for 'Rams fans', 'the team', and 'Rams' are [IN], and the references to 'the Cowboys' and '49ers' are [OTHER] throughout the comment.	The comment is primarily discussing the in-group team and their fans. 1. "Rams fans" in the first sentence refers to the fans of the in-group team, so it is tagged [IN]. 2. "the team" in the first sentence refers to the Rams as well, which is the in-group team, so it is also tagged [IN].3. In the second sentence, "Rams" refers to the in-group team, so it is tagged [IN]. 4. "the Cowboys" and "49ers" in the second sentence refer to other teams in the NFL that are not the in-group or out-group, hence they are tagged [OTHER].5. "The Rams" in the third sentence again refers to the in-group team, so it is tagged [IN].6. "49ers" and "Cowboys" in the fourth sentence are referring to other teams, so they are tagged [OTHER].7. "the Rams" again in the fourth sentence refers to the in-group team, so it is tagged [IN].8.

Given that the commenter is an Eagles fan, the term "this shitty defense" is likely referring to the Eagles' defense. Despite the Eagles' low win probability, the mention is clearly focused on the in-group (Eagles) defense and its poor performance, leading to the expletive reaction. Thus, "this shitty defense" is tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Eagles.	The phrase "this shitty defense" implies a sense of ownership or direct criticism from the commenter, suggesting that it refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports, which in this case is the Eagles. Fans typically take ownership when criticizing their own team's performance. Therefore, "this shitty defense" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	1676256012.0	eagles	chiefs	Genjoi		2.0	0.220422208309174	[5]

"Purdy" is Brock Purdy, a quarterback for the 49ers, thus tagged as [IN].2. "he" in "he's feeling the pressure" also refers to Brock Purdy, thus tagged as [IN].3. "the D." in "isn't trusting the D." refers to the defense of the 49ers and is tagged as [IN].4. "My man BCB" is a nickname for Brock Purdy, thus tagged as [IN].5. "He's" in "He's got this" continues to refer to Brock Purdy, thus tagged as [IN].The win probability being high at 76.9% suggests the in-group team is likely to win, which aligns with a supportive comment encouraging a player from the in-group (Purdy) to stay calm and trust his defense. Thus, each reference to Purdy and the defense pertains to the in-group. Therefore, TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS are correctly identified.	The commenter is discussing the performance of Purdy, a player for the 49ers, who is the in-group team. The use of "Purdy" identifies the player, and "he" in the same sentence refers to him, hence both should be tagged [IN]. The phrase "isn't trusting the D." refers to the defense of the 49ers, thus "the D." is also tagged [IN]. The subsequent sentences continue to talk about "My man BCB" and "He," both referring to the same player, Purdy, further indicating that "My man BCB" and "He" should be tagged [IN]. The supportive tone ("He's got this") suggests that all mentions are regarding the in-group team, making it consistent in tagging all relevant expressions as [IN].	1672616898.0	49ers	raiders	Tsukune_Surprise	:jerseyaway16: Joe Montana	5.0	0.768608272075653	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

The phrase "This line" refers to a part of the team (most likely the offensive line) that the commenter feels is performing poorly. Since there's no qualification or additional context in the phrase, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is talking about the in-group team (Titans) because fans are generally concerned with the performance of their own team. Therefore, "This line" is tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team.	The comment uses the term 'This line' to describe the offensive or defensive line's poor performance, without explicitly mentioning which team it is referring to. However, fans typically criticize their own team more harshly, especially in negative contexts. Therefore, 'This line' is likely referring to the in-group team that the commenter supports. Hence, 'This line' should be tagged with [IN] since it implicitly refers to the Titans' line.	1663637072.0	titans	bills	Danny23a		1.0	0.013100326061249001	[5]

The term "Players" is used without specifying a team, which typically suggests the commenter is referring to their own team's players. Additionally, the comment speaks generally to the performance and issues encountered during the game, without mentioning the opponent. Therefore, "Players" is tagged as [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group team's players who the commenter supports.	The commenter states that "Players are playing well," which is generally a positive assessment that a fan would make about the in-group team they support. The negative aspect mentioned, "turnovers have covered up the issues today," still ties into an overall commentary about the in-group's performance. Therefore, 'Players' should be tagged with [IN] as it implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Browns.

The usage of "ua" appears to be a typographical error for "us," implying "us" is the in-group. Given the low win probability of 9.8%, it suggests that the commenter is pessimistic about the Seahawks' chances of winning. Therefore, "ua" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the Seahawks, the in-group team supported by the commenter.	The commenter is likely predicting that the out-group (Panthers) will defeat the in-group (Seahawks). The use of 'ua' is a typo for 'us', which the commenter uses to refer to the in-group team they support. Thus, 'ua' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group. 'They' implicitly refers to the out-group, but since it is not explicitly tagged, only 'ua' requires tagging.	1670803225.0	seahawks	panthers	CUL8R_05		1.0	0.0982122136583636	[5]

['the WR group']	[(56, 68)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is lamenting their pre-season belief that the wide receiver group would be a strength. Since this is something a fan would complain about within the context of their own team, it is reasonable to infer that 'the WR group' refers to the in-group team (Jaguars). The win probability is low, suggesting the team is not performing well, adding context to the frustration expressed by the commenter. Therefore, 'the WR group' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an aspect of the in-group team.	The commenter is expressing disappointment about the perceived strength of a particular position group (the WR group) on their team, which suggests they are criticizing the in-group team they support (Jaguars). Fans typically discuss specific position groups like wide receivers within the context of their own team unless specified otherwise. Therefore, 'the WR group' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, and it is the reason for 'thinking [IN] would be a strength'. Hence, the tagging and the target are correct.	1633887181.0	jaguars	titans	FearlessPickle	King Dedede :KingDedede:	6.0	0.297409355640411	[5]

Since there is no explicit mention of the Dolphins or Bears in the comment, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] to reflect that the critique is implicitly directed at the in-group team, the Dolphins.	The commenter describes someone or something as "Actual trash," which is usually a strong criticism. Given that fans typically criticize their own team more harshly than their opponents, especially in a moment of frustration, it is more likely that the commenter is referring to their in-group team, the Dolphins.

The term 'Vikings' explicitly refers to the in-group team, so it should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, 'Boyd' is most likely a player on the Vikings that the commenter is expressing affection for, so it should also be tagged as [IN]. Despite the high win probability, the commenter acknowledges a strength of the out-group (DL players) but still frames it in the context of in-group dominance. Therefore, the tagged output and referring expressions are correct.	The first sentence criticizes the out-group (the Bears), identified as "CHI", while lamenting the in-group's (the Vikings) performance. "CHI" clearly refers to the out-group, thus should be tagged '[OUT].' "Vikings" directly refers to the in-group, so it should be tagged '[IN].'In the second sentence, the commenter expresses affection for a player, Boyd. Boyd is associated with the in-group (the Vikings), indicated by the context where the commenter prefaces the declaration with "PS."

Since the commenter empathizes with Vrabel, it aligns with them being a Titans supporter. Therefore, 'Vrabel' should be tagged [IN].	Mike Vrabel is the head coach of the Tennessee Titans, the in-group team that the commenter supports. Therefore, the reference to Vrabel should be tagged as [IN]. The comment expresses empathy towards Vrabel's frustration, which aligns with a fan's perspective towards their own team's coaching staff. Thus, 'Vrabel' is tagged with [IN] as it clearly refers to a key member of the in-group team.	1638124663.0	titans	patriots	baitXtheXnoose	:Neely:	3.0	0.19047990441322304	[5]

The commenter is likely praising a player from their in-group team since 'FIELDS' refers to Justin Fields, a quarterback for the Bears. Using 'GOAT' (Greatest Of All Time) is indicative of strong approval or support.

Additionally, "the Steelers" should be tagged as [OUT] because it refers to the opponent team in this particular game. The phrase "if we can get a stop" implicitly refers to the Bears' defensive ability, reinforcing the fact that the commenter supports the Bears, even though "we" is not tagged due to the explicit team names already being tagged. The win probability is low for the Bears, indicating that they are likely in a losing position, which matches the context of the comment discussing a possible victory margin. Therefore, the tagged output and the listed referring expressions are reasonable and correctly denote the in-group and out-group references.	The commenter directly refers to 'the Bears', which is the in-group team, indicating their support. The phrase 'if we can get a stop' implies that the commenter is rooting for the Bears to maintain their current lead. On the other hand, 'the Steelers' refers to the out-group team that they are playing against. Hence, 'the Bears' should be tagged [IN] and 'the Steelers' should be tagged [OUT]. The comment attributes a potential victory to the in-group, Bears, and mentions the opponent, Steelers, indicating their respective roles in this scenario.	1636423284.0	bears	steelers			8.0	0.074670970439911	[5, 5]

Furthermore, the pronoun 'He' is used without any qualification, making it probable that it refers to a well-known figure within the in-group team in such a context. Given that the in-group is the Raiders, 'He' should be tagged as [IN] to denote it refers to an in-group player. Additionally, the win probability is low, indicating the team might be underperforming, providing further context for the need to defend their own players.	The commenter is providing a justification or excuse, which fans typically do for their own team's players rather than for the opposing team's players. Since the comment is about the in-group (Raiders) and the pronoun 'He' refers to a player that the commenter is defending, 'He' should be tagged as referring to the in-group. Therefore, 'He' is tagged with [IN] as it clearly refers to a Raiders player.	1670190990.0	raiders	chargers	AFXTIWN		2.0	0.329620063304901	[5]

The high win probability indicates that the Packers are likely doing well in the game. The comment expresses frustration towards Stokes' decision-making, implying in-group frustration rather than criticism of the out-group. Hence, 'STOKES' is tagged as [IN] to denote that he is part of the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The commenter mentions "STOKES," a player for the Packers, the in-group team. The exclamation appears to be directed towards the actions of this player, possibly during a play. As "STOKES" is the only directly mentioned entity and is a member of the in-group, it should be tagged with [IN]. Therefore, the target and the referring expression accurately reflect that this comment is about an in-group player.	1640476017.0	packers	browns	priestkalim	:87:	5.0	0.912396319210529	[5]

Given the in-group is the Cowboys, the sentence implies their defensive struggles if all receiving options for the out-group (Eagles) are open, leading to no pressure on their own quarterback. Thus, "the QB" should be tagged [IN], referring to the Cowboys' quarterback, as the comment implicitly centers around the in-group's detrimental circumstances on defense. The low win probability further indicates the in-group, Cowboys, are probably struggling, justifying the focus on their quarterback's precarious situation.	The comment is likely talking about the in-group's quarterback, implying frustration with the lack of defensive pressure. The phrase 'the QB' should be tagged as [IN] because the commenter is frustrated that the opposing team's defense cannot reach their quarterback, thereby implicitly criticizing their own team's defense and showing concern for their own quarterback.	1671925944.0	cowboys	eagles	Wilcrest		1.0	0.223204523324966	[5]

[IN] What are your expectations for a 4th round rookie playing one of the hardest positions in football ? 	['[SENT]']	[(16, 22)]	['[IN]']	In this comment, the first sentence questions whether a player is a bust. The second sentence seems defensive, explaining that the player's performance should be considered in the context of being a 4th round rookie playing a difficult position. This type of defensive comment is typically something a fan would say about a player from the team they support (in-group). As there is no explicit reference to the in-group team (Seahawks) or any specific player, the entire second sentence implicitly refers to the in-group, defending one of their players. Given the win probability is relatively high, the commenter likely still believes in their team and its players, which supports the in-group context. Therefore, '[SENT]' for the second sentence is tagged with '[IN]' since the comment indirectly refers to an in-group player and is defending them.	The second sentence seems to be a defense or justification for a player who is likely from the in-group. This is because the commenter appears to be addressing criticism by highlighting the difficulty of the rookie's position and his draft status, which is something a fan would typically do for their own team. There is no explicit reference to the in-group rookie, but the context suggests that the commenter is speaking about their in-group team's player. Therefore, the sentence itself is tagged as referring to the in-group ([IN]) even though there is no explicit in-group reference in the text.	1670188730.0	seahawks	rams	Its_0ver		1.0	0.6359965801239009	[5]

[SENT] The people who put that infrastructure together also hired the " who " that no longer are employed there that drafted [IN] . [SENT] Try again . 	['Fields']	[(125, 131)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is discussing actions taken within the past personnel decisions of the Bears, as indicated by the reference to drafting Fields, who is a player on the Bears (the in-group). The win probability is low, suggesting frustration or reflection on past management decisions regarding their team. The commenter might be frustrated with the former staff who brought in Fields but who are now not employed by the in-group team. 'Fields' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group, the Bears. The second sentence does not explicitly refer to any team but conveys an ongoing criticism implied to be directed at the in-group's previous decisions.	The comment mentions 'that drafted Fields,' which refers to Justin Fields, a quarterback for the Bears. This indicates the commenter is talking about someone or something related to the Bears, hence 'Fields' should be tagged [IN]. The rest of the comment is vague and does not directly refer to any entities that need tagging, hence the tag for 'Try again' does not change the overall target annotation. Therefore, 'Fields' is the correct tagged referring expression because he is a player for the in-group team.	1671392970.0	bears	eagles	Matzah_Rella		1.0	0.0723082572221756	[5]

The comment mentions "mahomes," who is a prominent player for the Chiefs, signaling that the comment is about in-group performance and hopes. Despite the low win probability (22.4%), the commenter is expressing hope that Mahomes will play well. The phrase "good start" suggests that the commenter is framing the situation positively regarding their team and anticipates a strong performance from Mahomes, which further supports the in-group reference. Therefore, "mahomes" should be tagged with [IN] since he refers to an in-group player. The rest of the comment is contextually about the in-group, reflecting their situation and hopes for improvement. Thus, 'mahomes' is tagged correctly as [IN].	The commenter supports the Chiefs and is expressing a hope for Mahomes, a key player for the Chiefs, to perform well. This reflects their support and concern for the in-group team's performance. Therefore, 'mahomes' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	1633922397.0	chiefs	bills	keeton4	Pat "Kermit" Mahomes	3.0	0.223799049854279	[5]

The win probability for the in-group Packers is very low at 12.5%, suggesting they are likely losing or experiencing a negative in-game event. Given the context, this exclamation is implicitly directed towards the in-group team (Packers) because fans are more likely to express such frustration when their own team is not performing well. Thus, the sentence should be tagged [IN], and since there is no explicit word or phrase mentioning the team, the entire sentence itself should be tagged.	The comment expresses frustration, which is usually aligned with a fan's emotional response towards their own team's poor performance or situation. Since there's no explicit reference to specific players or teams, the entire comment implicitly refers to the in-group, which in this case is the Packers. The expression of frustration ('Fffuuuucccckkkk') suggests the commenter is reacting to something unfavorable happening to their team. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged as '[IN]' to capture the implicit reference to the in-group team.	1636323219.0	packers	chiefs	Th3Kais3r		1.0	0.12544792890548695	[5]

[IN] What the fuck do you have to lose 	['we', '[SENT]']	[(15, 17), (37, 43)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The pronoun 'we' typically indicates the in-group, suggesting that the commenter is a Ravens fan expressing frustration about a decision made by their team, so it should be tagged [IN]. Although the win probability is almost evenly split, the frustration is directed towards the in-group's decision-making. The second sentence appears to continue this frustration but does not have an explicit reference to an entity; however, given the context, it's clear that the commenter is still addressing the Ravens' actions. Therefore, the entire second sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN] as it implicitly refers to the in-group team's situation.	The commenter uses "we," which indicates they are referring to the in-group team, the Ravens, as fans typically use "we" to refer to the team they support. The second sentence carries the sentiment of questioning the decision-making of the team the commenter supports without explicitly mentioning the team, implying frustration directed at the Ravens. Thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' for the second sentence since it refers to the in-group team implicitly.Therefore, the tagging of 'we' with [IN] and the entire second sentence with [IN] is appropriate.	1641753654.0	ravens	steelers			7.0	0.489916741847992	[5, 5]

['[SENT]', 'them']	[(0, 6), (84, 88)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	The commenter is giving strategic advice likely aimed at their own team, the Bills, which is suggested by the first sentence's lack of specific targeting language. Hence, the first segment implicitly refers to the in-group and should be tagged with '[IN]'. In the second sentence, "them" clearly refers to the Chiefs, the opponents, indicating that the commenter wants their team to execute a strategy that forces the opponents to use up time. Thus, "them" should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group.The win probability is 100.0%, meaning the in-group is almost certain to win, allowing the commenter to focus on very specific strategic details for the current situation, often not spelled out explicitly but contextually understood.	The commenter is giving strategic advice presumably intended for their own team. The first sentence is critique or advice without an explicit reference to any team, but it is most likely directed at the in-group team, which is the Bills, suggesting how they should handle kickoffs. Therefore, the first sentence should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, "them" refers to the opposing team wasting time on a return, indicating the strategic action's target, which is the out-group team (Chiefs). So, "them" should be tagged as [OUT].	1642993314.0	bills	chiefs	krazylegs36		4.0	1.0	[5, 5]

['[SENT]']	[(26, 32)]	['[IN]']	The first sentence "Done for the day" does not clearly refer to any specific entity and can be a general statement, so it remains untagged. The second sentence, "Absolutely fucking unacceptable," is an expression of frustration or dissatisfaction, which is likely directed towards the in-group team (Patriots) because fans typically express such sentiments about their own team's performance. Despite a relatively high win probability, the commenter is still criticizing their team, potentially focusing on a bad play or series of plays. Since there is no explicit mention of the Patriots in the second sentence but the sentiment is directed towards them, the entire sentence is tagged implicitly as referring to the in-group. Hence, the second [SENT] is tagged with [IN] as the criticism is directed towards the in-group team, fitting within the context that fans usually direct their dissatisfaction towards their own team.	The second sentence expresses strong disappointment, likely directed toward the in-group team, especially since there's a lack of other context. Fans typically express such frustration about their own team when things are going badly. The first sentence doesn't have enough context to determine the sentiment, so it remains untagged. Thus, '[SENT]' for the second sentence should be tagged as [IN] since it reflects the commenter's frustration with the in-group team.	1633888284.0	patriots	texans	Rhythmimic		1.0	0.5862903892993929	[5]

[SENT] did n't even glance over from my meal 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The comment appears to be sarcastic about a kick, suggesting that the outcome was very predictable in a negative sense, and the commenter didn't even bother to look away from their meal. Given the win probability is at 40%, the Buccaneers are currently trailing, which suggests frustration from the fan. The lack of an explicit mention of any team or player in the first sentence implies it's a general comment about the in-group's performance. The fact that the commenter didn't even glance over from their meal underscores their disappointment with the in-group team, the Buccaneers. Hence, the entirety of the first sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group's performance.Thus, the first sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged as '[IN]', reflecting the fan's implicit reference to their own team's struggles. There is no explicit word/phrase in this sentence referring to the in-group, so '[SENT]' serves as the referring expression.

Since 'the Colts' is the opponent team and the ones committing the infractions, it should be tagged as [OUT]. The win probability is still relatively low, so the Titans are likely behind, making penalties against the Colts significant for the fan. Thus, 'the Colts' correctly gets tagged with [OUT]. The rest of the sentence does not contain specific references to other entities.	The commenter mentions "the Colts holding calls," referring to perceived penalties against the Colts that the officials are finally noticing. The commenter supports the Titans and is criticizing the Colts, thus the expression "the Colts" refers to the out-group. Therefore, "the Colts" should be tagged [OUT], as it is the target of the comment's criticism against the Titans' opponent. The '[SENT]' token itself is not directly tagged since there is an explicit reference to the out-group in the comment.	1635704312.0	titans	colts	cawkblocker		6.0	0.443975746631622	[5]

The phrase "this organization" is a general critique commonly directed toward in-group teams rather than the opponent, as the commenter would feel responsible or invested enough to demand changes within their supported team. Thus, "this organization" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Bears.	The commenter is calling for people to be fired within their own team's organization, which indicates frustration with the in-group team. 'this organization' refers to the team the commenter supports, the Bears, and thus should be tagged with [IN].	1662922661.0	bears	49ers	Jerome3412		1.0	0.0976954773068428	[5]

Given the high win probability for the in-group, it is likely that the comment is focusing on an individual play rather than the overall game performance. 'Allen' therefore refers to a player on the in-group and should be tagged with [IN]. This aligns with fans frequently directing criticism or praise towards their own players, especially in moments of specific plays, even if the team is generally performing well.	Allen, in this context, is referring to Josh Allen, who is a notable player for the Bills. Since the commenter is criticizing his blocking, it indicates a focus on the in-group team, which the commenter supports.

The low win probability indicates that the in-group team is likely struggling, so comments are more likely focused on their players' actions. Since 'Charles' is a player on the in-group team, the tag should be [IN], and the comment is implicitly about the in-group. Therefore, 'Charles' should be tagged as [IN].	Charles is likely a player on the in-group team, the Texans. The use of "Lol" suggests a light-hearted or familiar tone, which is more typical when referring to one's own team or players rather than the opposing team.

Given the win probability is high at 75.6%, it is reasonable to assume that the in-group team is doing well and the commenter is supportive of their performance. Thus, '#28', 'he', and 'he' refer to a 49ers player and should be tagged as [IN].	The comment is praising the performance of a player designated with the number "#28," noting that he "runs hard as shit every single time he touches the ball." Such positive comments are typically directed toward players of the team the commenter supports (the in-group). Therefore, '#28' and the pronouns 'he' should be tagged with [IN] since they refer to the in-group player.	1632077267.0	49ers	eagles			4.0	0.755982041358948	[3, 3, 3]

Given that Taylor Heinicke is a quarterback for the Commanders, it indicates "taylor" refers to the in-group team. Despite the low win probability suggesting the game isn't going well for the Commanders, the criticism is directed towards the in-group's decision-making. Therefore, "taylor" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team.	The comment is complaining about a coaching decision to bench a player named Taylor. Since the decision is labeled as "stupid," it indicates dissatisfaction, which fans typically express about their own team's decisions. Taylor must be a player on the in-group (Commanders) team that the commenter supports.

In the second sentence, 'We' is a pronoun that fans often use to refer to their own team, indicating in-group support, so it is tagged [IN]. 'Zach' refers to Zach Wilson, who is a player for the New York Jets, which makes this a reference to an in-group player, thus tagged [IN]. Lastly, 'he' is a pronoun referring back to Zach Wilson, hence it is also tagged [IN]. The win probability being nearly 50% indicates a close game, thus the commenter appears to be discussing their strategy for their team hoping for better performance from their in-group player, Zach Wilson.	The commenter is expressing frustration or resignation, which fans typically do about their own team. 'We' is a collective pronoun often used by fans to refer to their own team. 'Zach' likely refers to Zach Wilson, a quarterback for the Jets, thus tagging him as [IN] since he is a member of the in-group. 'he' refers back to 'Zach', which again points to an in-group player.

The win probability is quite low, indicating the in-group is likely losing, thereby warranting such negative comments. 'This team' refers to the in-group team (Vikings), 'the head coach' refers to the head coach of the in-group team, and 'Zimmer' is the name of the head coach, so all these references should be tagged with [IN].	The commenter appears to be criticizing their own team, the Vikings, for their weakness and attributing it to the head coach, Zimmer. This indicates that the dissatisfaction is directed at the in-group team and its leadership. 'This team' is a general expression of disappointment, implying the in-group, and 'the head coach' and 'Zimmer' are specific references to the Vikings' coach. - 'This team' should be tagged [IN] because the commenter is likely disappointed with the performance of their supported team, the Vikings.- 'the head coach' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the head coach of the in-group team, responsible for their perceived weakness.- 'Zimmer' should be tagged [IN] because he is the head coach of the in-group team, the Vikings.Thus, the critique is directed at the in-group (the Vikings), making these references appropriate to tag as in-group.	1636317982.0	vikings	ravens			14.0	0.095546776449425	[5, 5, 5]

['McVay', 'his QB']	[(41, 46), (72, 78)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter mentions McVay and his QB, which are both specific people within the Rams organization. Given that the in-group is the Rams, the comment's main focus is on criticizing the decision-making and performance related to their team. Despite the high win probability, fans can still express dissatisfaction with particular aspects of their team's performance. Therefore, 'McVay' (the Rams coach) and 'his QB' (the Rams' quarterback) should be tagged with [IN] since they are both connected to the in-group team, the Rams.	The comment discusses a situation negatively affecting the in-group team, the Rams. 'McVay' refers to Sean McVay, the head coach of the Rams, thus it should be tagged [IN] as he is associated with the in-group. The phrase 'his QB' refers to the quarterback for McVay's team, which is also the in-group Rams. Therefore, both 'McVay' and 'his QB' should be tagged with [IN], as they are entities within the in-group team.	1640548463.0	rams	vikings	bwc_28	Blue & Yellow #62	1.0	0.714668892873974	[5, 5]

Given that the win probability for the in-group (Seahawks) is quite high at 81.1%, it is unlikely the commenter is complaining about their own team in this context. Rather, they might be expressing frustration about an unrelated event or a different game, potentially involving another team not connected to this matchup. Hence, '[SENT]' should be tagged [OTHER], indicating that the frustration being expressed is not linked to either the in-group or out-group in this specific game.	The sentence "Such bull shit" could be expressing frustration or disappointment about an event in the game. However, since there is no specific entity mentioned that ties directly to either the in-group (Seahawks) or the out-group (Titans), and without additional context, it cannot be definitively categorized as referencing the in-group or out-group. Therefore, the most reasonable categorization is [OTHER], indicating that the comment is a general expression of frustration not specifically tied to either team.	1632092827.0	seahawks	titans	afrobass	:sea1:​	2.0	0.811014741659164	[5]

['the refs', '[SENT]']	[(36, 44), (47, 53)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]']	The commenter is expressing frustration towards the referees, which are neutral parties and not affiliated with any team, thus tagged as [OTHER]. The sentiment of the comment indicates dissatisfaction with unfavorable calls made by the referees that negatively affect the in-group (Commanders). The in-group's win probability is relatively low, reflecting the impact of these calls. Each phrase mentioning 'the refs' or the related actions of the refs impacts the game but does not directly refer to either the in-group or the out-group. Consequently, phrases referring to referees are tagged as [OTHER]. The first two sentences explicitly mention 'the refs' and the impact of their decisions, thus these references to the refs are tagged as [OTHER]. The latter parts of the comment do not have clear referential expressions but relate to larger frustrations with referees' calls.Thus, 'the refs' should be tagged with [OTHER], and the second sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged [OTHER] owing to no direct team reference in those frustrations about calls. The rest of the comment does not have explicit references that need additional tagging.	The commenter is expressing frustration with the referees for what they perceive as unfair calls. The frustration is directed toward the refereeing, which isn't associated specifically with either the in-group or the out-group team. Therefore, 'the refs' in the first sentence and the reference to the call in the second sentence should be tagged as [OTHER]. The other sentences talk about the situation without explicitly referring to the in-group or out-group, and are left untagged except for indicating where a sentence pertains to [OTHER] where appropriate, ensuring the accurate tagging of implicit references. Thus, the first two sentences are tagged correctly as `[OTHER]`, while the rest of the comment detailing the sequence of events and expressing frustration remains without additional entity tags.	1670183656.0	commanders	giants	FloatAround		7.0	0.268035769462585	[5, 5]

[SENT] [IN] looks downright awful 	['Elum', 'him', 'He']	[(51, 55), (91, 94), (106, 108)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The win probability is relatively high for the in-group (Raiders), indicating they are probably doing well overall. However, the commenter is focusing on an individual player's poor performance. The name "Elum" and pronouns "him" and "He" are directly referring to the player's performance. Because fans typically discuss individual performances of their own team's players with such familiarity, it is reasonable to assume that "Elum" is a player for the in-group. Therefore, "Elum," "him," and "He" should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to a player from the Raiders. The second and third sentences are complaints about Elum's performance, which fits with fans' tendency to focus on specific players even during an overall positive game. Consequently, the sentences implicitly reference the in-group.	The commenter is expressing disappointment about a player's performance, likely a player from the in-group (Raiders), as fans tend to scrutinize and express frustration about their own team members' performances. The use of "SOME hope for Elum" suggests they expected better things from the player, indicating he is part of the team the commenter supports. The subsequent negative evaluations ("rough series for him," "looks downright awful") further indicate that "Elum," "him," and "He" are being scrutinized as part of the in-group.Thus, "Elum," "him," and "He" should be tagged with [IN] since they refer to an in-group player whose performance is being critically assessed. The lack of mention of any specific out-group opponent player reinforces that the focus is on an in-group player's poor performance. Therefore, the tagged output and referring expressions correctly identify entities as in-group references.	1663533291.0	raiders	cardinals	jake2hut		1.0	0.707570970058441	[5, 5, 5]

The win probability for the in-group team, the Ravens, is relatively high, indicating that they are doing well in the game. Given this context and the common tendency of fans to closely monitor their own players' conditions, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is concerned about an in-group player's well-being. There is no other explicit reference to either team or specific players, but "his" is tagged as [IN] because it implicitly refers to an in-group player from the Ravens that the commenter cares about. Hence, "his" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group Ravens' player.	The commenter is likely reassuring other fans that one of their own players is alright after a minor incident. The phrase "just grass kicked up in his face" implies that a specific player is being referred to, and since the commenter supports the Ravens, "his" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	1635096389.0	ravens	bengals	DenebSwift		2.0	0.664709120988846	[5]

The comment appreciates a throw made to him, indicating it is a positive comment about a successful in-group play. Given the context, 'ty Hilton' is tagged [IN] because he is a member of the in-group team. The win probability being 100.0% further suggests that the Colts are performing exceptionally well, which aligns with the positive tone of the comment. Therefore, 'ty Hilton' is the correct referring expression and should be tagged with [IN].	Ty Hilton is a well-known player for the Colts, the in-group team that the commenter supports.

'KC' and 'we' both refer to the in-group team, the Chiefs, and should be tagged [IN]. Meanwhile, 'the Bills' refers to another team in the NFL that is not the current opponent (Titans), so it should be tagged [OTHER]. The win probability being slightly above 50% indicates a close match, reinforcing the fan's concern about overall respect rather than immediate performance. Thus, 'KC' and 'we' should be tagged with [IN], and 'the Bills' should be tagged [OTHER].	The commenter is talking about their frustrations with the Kansas City Chiefs (KC) being underestimated, which suggests the commenter supports the Chiefs. 'KC' and 'we' refer to the in-group team, the Chiefs, and should be tagged with [IN]. The 'Bills' are being mentioned as a different opponent not involved in the current game, so 'the Bills' should be tagged with [OTHER] since they are neither the in-group nor out-group.	1667788172.0	chiefs	titans	tehbishop	Priest Holmes	0.0	0.55721777677536	[5, 5, 5]

Given that 'Waller' is a member of the in-group team (Raiders), the word 'Waller' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player. Additionally, considering the context, the first sentence is likely about the in-group team's performance, as fans typically discuss their own team's successful plays with pride or criticism of specific moments. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN] since it implicitly refers to a play made by the in-group team.	The comment is implicitly supportive of the pass, which suggests the pass was made by the in-group team, the Raiders. Hence, the first sentence should be tagged as [IN]. 'Waller' refers to Darren Waller, a player for the Raiders, and critique of his effort indicates the commenter is talking about his own in-group team.

Boyle is a player for the Ravens (the in-group), so his name should be tagged with [IN]. Additionally, "He" in the second sentence refers back to Boyle, so it should also be tagged with [IN]. The win probability being relatively low suggests that the in-group team is struggling, which aligns with the negative sentiment expressed in the comment. Therefore, the referring expressions 'Boyle' and 'He' are correctly tagged as [IN] due to their direct reference to the in-group player and the context of the comment.	The comment indicates a specific emotional reaction to an event related to Boyle, who is a player for the Ravens, the in-group team with respect to the commenter. Therefore, 'Boyle' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group entity. The pronoun 'He' in the next sentence refers back to Boyle, and should also be tagged with [IN] for the same reason. The comment implicitly shows concern for the performance or well-being of a player from the in-group.	1666917564.0	ravens	buccaneers	TrainingMarsupial521	:ED: Ed Reed	4.0	0.281045079231262	[5, 5]

['he', 'he']	[(88, 90), (100, 102)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment seems to be discussing a significant injury to a player, and given the context, it's likely that the commenter is talking about a player from the in-group team, the Browns. The win probability is slightly in favor of the Browns, suggesting that the game could still be competitive, which implies that the commenter might be concerned about the impact of this injury on the team's performance moving forward.In the second sentence, the use of 'he' twice is pivotal. Given that the commenter supports the Browns, it's reasonable to infer that they are referring to a key Browns player who is injured. Injuries like the one described (requiring surgery and ending the season) typically garner strong emotional responses from fans discussing their own team. Additionally, without context indicating otherwise, the default assumption in a conversation by a fan is typically referring to their own team's players.Therefore, 'he' and 'he' should be tagged with [IN] since they refer to an in-group player, conforming to the overall context of concern about the player's availability and impact on the team's chances. The first sentence is a general statement about the nature of the injury and does not require specific tagging.The comment is about a player who suffered a severe injury requiring surgery, and	The commenter is discussing an injury and its repercussions for a player's season, likely referring to a key player on their own team whose absence would be significant. As such, it is reasonable that the commenter is speaking about a player from the in-group team, the Browns, because they are expressing concern over the player's ability to return. So, 'he' in both instances should be tagged [IN] as they are referring to the in-group player.	1635704929.0	browns	steelers	HangryPete	:rally-opposum:	0.0	0.565474361181259	[5, 5]

['He', 'he', 'Higgins']	[(7, 9), (26, 28), (78, 85)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter seems to be giving a detailed assessment of a wide receiver (WR1), mentioning his positive qualities like blocking well and drawing double teams but acknowledging that these actions do not equate to the impact expected from a top-tier WR. Given the in-group is the Browns and the out-group is the Chargers, and considering that the performance of a specific player (likely from the in-group due to the lack of any negative sentiment directly related to the opponent) is being critiqued, it makes sense that the entities described should be tagged as in-group. 'He' and 'he' both refer to the same in-group player being discussed. Additionally, 'Higgins' is likely to be a Browns player under discussion, and by mentioning his touchdown (td), the commenter is implicitly referring to the in-group. Thus, all instances - 'He', 'he', and 'Higgins' (and the sentence's relevant parts) - should be tagged with [IN], matching the in-group context of the comment.	The phrase "blocks well and he draws double teams to open up others" shows a positive assessment of the player, which suggests the commenter is referring to an in-group player. Therefore, 'He' and 'he' should be tagged [IN], as they are referring to this player. Additionally, 'Higgins' is a player for the in-group team, the Browns. Therefore, 'Higgins' should be tagged [IN] as well. The overall tone suggests the critique is meant for a player that the commenter supports, indicating an in-group reference.	1633899750.0	browns	chargers	meyer_33_09	:browns:	1.0	0.463081270456314	[5, 5, 5]

This indicates frustration toward an in-group player for a mistake. The win probability being low further supports this as the team might not be performing well, leading to pointed comments towards their own team. Therefore, "Walker" is tagged [IN]. The second sentence, lacking specific names but following the topic of taunting during a live play (a criticism), implies a continuation of discussing the in-group team's error. As such, '[SENT]' is tagged [IN], signifying the entire sentence pertains to the in-group contextually.	The comment criticizes 'Walker' for taunting while the play was still live. Given that 'Walker' is criticized without needing qualification, it suggests this player is familiar to the commenter and likely part of the in-group team (Lions).

'They' in this context is positioned as the ones responsible for creating a disadvantage, hinting that 'killing the whole quarter' is detrimental to the in-group's strategy or momentum. Hence, 'They' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the opposing team.	The commenter is expressing frustration about the entire quarter being consumed, which is a likely criticism directed at the out-group. 'They' refers to the Titans, the out-group team, as it is natural for a supporter to be displeased with the opposing team's control of the clock. Therefore, 'They' should be tagged as [OUT].	1668737202.0	packers	titans	flatbushz7		8.0	0.416414856910706	[2]

[IN] Not perfect but improved for sure 	['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (60, 66)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment is reviewing the performance of the team that the commenter supports. Given the high win probability of 92%, the commenter is likely referring to the in-group team's performance being "pretty well" overall and "improved for sure" despite not being perfect. There are no explicit mentions of the team, so the sentences themselves are tagged with [IN], indicating that the general evaluation is directed towards the in-group team, the Eagles. Thus, '[SENT]' for both sentences are tagged [IN] to show the implicit reference to the Eagles' performance.	The comment appears to be evaluating the performance of a team, without any explicit negatives or sarcastic remarks that would indicate criticism from a rival. Given the balanced and somewhat positive nature of the remarks ("Mixed play but overall but I would say pretty well" and "Not perfect but improved for sure"), it's reasonable to infer that the commenter is talking about the in-group team, as fans are more likely to provide objective or slightly favorable insights about their own team. Thus, even though there are no explicit mentions of the team, the entire comment contextually refers to the in-group, leading to both sentences being tagged with [IN].	1662922016.0	eagles	lions	illscientist7	Reed Blankenship Truther	1.0	0.919815219938755	[5, 5]

The use of "our" typically signifies the team the commenter supports, thus referring to the in-group. Despite the high win probability in favor of the Colts, the commenter is focusing on a negative aspect of their own team. Therefore, "our dogshit pass D" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, the Colts. The truncated phrase "Gotta love [IN]" captures the implication of the complaint that is directed towards the in-group team.	The comment uses the term "our," which usually indicates the commenter is referring to their own team, the in-group. The phrase "dogshit pass D" is also disparaging the pass defense, which a fan would typically only do when criticizing their own team. Therefore, "our dogshit pass D" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1636073159.0	colts	jets	YupThatsHim		4.0	0.880033619701862	[5]

['our fucking defense', '[SENT]']	[(18, 37), (48, 54)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is expressing frustration towards the in-group team, specifically their defense, by using terms like "our" and "fucking defense," which strongly indicate a direct relationship with the in-group, the Browns. Although the win probability is quite high, this immediate negative reaction suggests dissatisfaction with a particular aspect of the game's performance. Therefore, "our fucking defense" should be tagged as [IN] as it refers to the in-group team. The second sentence continues this complaint without an explicit mention, so the entire sentence should be tagged [IN] as it carries over the sentiment from the first sentence.	The comment is expressing extreme frustration with the team's performance, specifically the defense, which indicates the commenter is deeply upset about their own team's performance. The phrase "our fucking defense" clearly indicates that the commenter is talking about the in-group team they support. The second sentence, "This is utterly pathetic," continues the criticism without explicitly mentioning who 'this' refers to. Given the context and the emotional continuity from the first sentence, 'This' is implicitly criticizing the in-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN] since the whole comment expresses dissatisfaction with the in-group team, the Browns.	1632079545.0	browns	texans	boomerbrowns	:browns:	10.0	0.896975887729558	[5, 5]

Ben Johnson is likely a key player for the in-group team (Lions). The win probability is not very high, which means the in-group is not performing well, and the loss of a key player could be critical. Thus, 'Ben Johnson' should be tagged [IN] as he is a member of the in-group team. Despite the sentence not mentioning the injury's impact on the game explicitly, the context can be inferred to refer to the player's importance to the team.	Ben Johnson is a player on the in-group team, the Lions. The comment is updating on his status, noting that he is out for the game due to a brain injury. 'Ben Johnson' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a player from the in-group team.	1668367753.0	lions	bears	AttorneyAtLion	I wanna die	3.0	0.415926873683929	[5]

['They', 'us']	[(130, 134), (140, 142)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	The game is between the Vikings (in-group) and the Cardinals (out-group), and the win probability for the Vikings is 100%, indicating they are about to win or have already secured the win. In the first sentence, there are no specific mentions of either the in-group or out-group team, but it discusses the potential negative outcome of a throw, which could be a general statement. While it does have a broader focus, it does not identify any particular team directly. In the second sentence, the word 'They' should be tagged as [OUT] since it is referring to the out-group (Cardinals), who gave the Vikings (in-group) a chance, potentially through a turnover or a mistake. The word 'us' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the commenter's team, the Vikings, benefitting from the opportunity given by the Cardinals.Therefore, the correct tagging captures the implicit references to the teams involved, with 'They' referring to the out-group (Cardinals) and 'us' referring to the in-group (Vikings).	The first sentence expresses concern about the possibility of the opposing team making a mistake and the game being decided as a result. Given this context, "They" in the second sentence likely refers to the out-group team, which is the Cardinals, as they are the ones providing the in-group team (the Vikings) a chance. "us" in the same sentence refers to the in-group team (Vikings) since the commenter is a supporter of the Vikings and is acknowledging the opportunity given to their team. Therefore, "They" should be tagged as [OUT] and "us" should be tagged as [IN].	1632094239.0	vikings	cardinals	DingyPorpoise		2.0	1.0	[5, 5]

['Eagles', 'Hurts', '[SENT]']	[(22, 28), (58, 63), (159, 165)]	['[OUT]', '[OUT]', '[OUT]']	The comment is clearly about the Eagles fans and their actions towards Hurts jerseys. Given the in-group is the Cowboys and the out-group is the Eagles, both 'Eagles' and 'Hurts' should be tagged as [OUT] since they refer to the opponent team. The second and third sentences continue discussing the activities of Eagles fans metaphorically. Therefore, '[SENT]' in the third sentence should also be tagged as referring to the [OUT], as the entire commentary implicitly targets the out-group fans burning jerseys and warming cheesesteaks, maintaining the focus on the out-group without directly mentioning them again. This is consistent with the high win probability for the Cowboys, suggesting a sense of superiority or mocking tone towards the Eagles by the commenter.	The commenter is a supporter of the Cowboys, and the comment is disparaging towards the Eagles and their fans. In the first sentence, 'Eagles' refers to the out-group team and should be tagged [OUT]. 'Hurts' refers to Jalen Hurts, a player for the Eagles, so it should also be tagged [OUT]. The second sentence is a continuation of the previous sentence's thought, which refers implicitly to Eagles fans burning jerseys, so it does not have an explicit referring expression but is about the out-group. The third sentence makes a snide remark about Eagles fans warming a cheesesteak over a burning jersey, which is again implicitly about the out-group. Therefore, '[SENT]' in the second sentence and '[SENT]' in the third sentence should both be tagged [OUT].	1632794670.0	cowboys	eagles	the-pessimist		10.0	0.964071378111839	[5, 5, 5]

'We' is tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team. 'Our offense' also should be tagged [IN] because it pertains to the in-group's offensive unit. 'Jimmy' refers to Jimmy Garoppolo, the in-group's quarterback, and is thus tagged [IN].In the second sentence, 'Refball' (a colloquial term referring to bad or biased refereeing) is used without specifying a team, but since the sentiment is negative (implying bias), it's tagged [OTHER] because it doesn't directly refer to the in-group or out-group but the officiating. The final sentence, which talks broadly about the situation of missing starters on defense, indirectly refers to the in-group's challenges without naming specific entities, so '[SENT]' is tagged [IN] due to the in-group context. The win probability is extremely low, indicating a likely loss situation, which aligns with the context of the commentator discussing the challenges faced rather than the opposing team.	The comment clearly demonstrates a fan perspective, indicated by the use of "we" when referring to their team, which is the in-group (49ers). 'We' is tagged [IN] as it refers to the commenter and fellow supporters. 'Our offense' and 'Jimmy' both refer to elements of the in-group team, thus should also be tagged [IN]. 'Refball' is a term referring to refereeing, which is independent of the specific teams playing and could imply a bias unrelated to either team, hence it is tagged [OTHER]. The final sentence implicitly references the in-group by discussing the issue of missing starters, relevant to the 49ers' context, so the [SENT] token is tagged [IN] to denote this in-group reference without an explicit noun phrase.	1665949598.0	49ers	falcons	CodyNorthrup	:shanahan: Kyle Shanahan	3.0	0.0006963014602660023	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

The absence of explicit mentions of players or teams suggests it is an implicit critique of the in-group's performance. Therefore, the sentence refers to the in-group (Saints) despite no specific entity being named, resulting in '[SENT]' being tagged with '[IN]'.	The comment is expressing a critical view on a performance, likely referring to the in-group team, as fans typically critique their own team when they perform poorly. Since there is no explicit reference to a team or player, the sentence itself is tagged as referring implicitly to the in-group. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' indicating the critique is aimed at the in-group team, the Saints.	1632081466.0	saints	panthers	Mahrez14		0.0	0.0006360411643979713	[5]

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OTHER]']	In this comment, there is no explicit mention of either the in-group or the out-group teams (Eagles or Giants). The high win probability suggests the Eagles are almost certainly going to win, leading to a possible relaxed state of commentary that discusses general observations rather than specific in-group or out-group performance. However, the phrase is still related to something happening in the game, but without more context provided, it appears to refer to something neutral or ambiguous. Therefore, it gets tagged as [OTHER]. The sentence itself ("Glad I'm not the only one seeing it.") does not directly reference any specific entity, resulting in the entire sentence being tagged as [OTHER].	The sentence lacks explicit references to either the in-group or out-group. Since it is a general statement that could apply to any team or situation, it falls into the category of 'other.' Thus, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with [OTHER] as there are no specific words/phrases denoting in-group or out-group entities.	1673223329.0	eagles	giants	DoitfortheHoff		1.0	0.996566141489893	[5]

The exclamation is a clear indication of the commenter's support for their team's quarterback, especially given that 'Herbo' is a popular nickname for Justin Herbert among Chargers fans. Therefore, the tagged word 'HERBOOOOO' should be labeled as [IN], denoting the in-group.	The word 'HERBOOOOO' is likely a cheer or enthusiastic exclamation for a player named Herbert, who is part of the in-group team, the Chargers. Since the commenter is showing support and excitement, it is logical that 'HERBOOOOO' refers to an in-group player. Thus, the tag for 'HERBOOOOO' should be [IN].	1664142789.0	chargers	jaguars	GamingMedicalGuy	Chargers	2.0	0.460992455482483	[5]

The term "refs" is not specific to either team playing in this game (Bengals vs. 49ers) and refers to officials who are part of the broader NFL organization, thereby warranting the [OTHER] tag. Additionally, considering the low win probability for the in-group, the commenter might be frustrated and blaming the referees for the team's poor performance. Hence, "Bengals" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group, and "refs" should be tagged [OTHER] since it refers to a neutral entity involved in the game but not specific to either the in-group or out-group.	The commenter is likely referring to a perceived bias or unfairness by the referees ('refs'), which often comes up in frustration when the in-group team, in this case, the Bengals, is playing. The word 'Bengals' directly refers to the in-group team and should be tagged [IN]. 'refs' is a general term that applies to officials in the NFL and does not specifically refer to the out-group team (49ers) but rather to an entity that is disrupting the game in the commenter's view. Therefore, 'refs' should be tagged [OTHER]. The phrase 'the nfl' remains untagged as it is a neutral entity providing context.	1639349493.0	bengals	49ers	owencantdance		5.0	0.144632935523987	[5, 5]

['we', 'This one']	[(12, 14), (59, 67)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter appears to be a frustrated fan of the Broncos, given the low win probability and negative sentiment in the comment. The pronoun 'we' is typically used by fans to refer to their own team, which means it should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, 'This one' refers back to 'an entirely new coaching staff' mentioned in the first sentence. Since 'we' directly refers to the in-group team, 'This one' also refers to part of the in-group (coaching staff) and should be tagged [IN] as well.	The commenter is clearly frustrated with the current coaching staff of their own team. The word 'we' in the first sentence directly refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, the Broncos, indicating the commenter wants their team to get new coaches. In the second sentence, 'This one' refers to the current coaching staff, which the commenter describes as "steaming garbage." This, plus the context, implies that 'This one' also refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. Thus, both 'we' and 'This one' should be tagged as [IN].	1634507667.0	broncos	raiders	TapDelicious8508		1.0	0.28527644276619	[5, 5]

'Mooney' refers to a player who has been a significant upgrade to the 49ers roster, thus tagging 'Mooney' as [IN] makes sense.2. 'the roster' refers to the in-group team's roster, so it should be labeled [IN].3. 'CMC' (Christian McCaffrey) is an impactful player for the 49ers, making 'CMC' [IN].4. '…he' refers to 'CMC', already identified as [IN].5. 'our offense' refers to the in-group's offensive squad, so 'our offense' is tagged [IN].6. 'our D' refers to the in-group's defense, hence 'our D' is tagged [IN].7. 'Moody' is again a reference related to the 49ers' physique or strategy, thus 'Moody' is [IN].8. 'we' is used to denote the in-group team, tagging 'we' as [IN] correctly.9. Another instance of 'we' should similarly be tagged [IN].	The comment expresses opinions about players and performance related to the in-group team, the 49ers. The commenter is discussing the impact of various players like "Mooney" and "CMC" on the team's roster and overall performance, indicating that these players are part of the in-group team:1. **Sentence 1**: s  - "Mooney" is identified as the upgrade to "the roster" this season. Since the discussion is about upgrades to the 49ers (the in-group), "Mooney" and "the roster" are tagged with [IN]. 2. **Sentence 2**: s  - The commenter argues about "CMC" being a more impactful player overall. Since "CMC" is being praised and discussed for turning the team's offense around, it indicates support for "CMC" as part of the in-group team. Consequently, "CMC" and "…he" referring to "CMC" are tagged with [IN]. s  - "our offense" is discussed as improving under "CMC's" influence, which implies the team's offense; thus, it is also tagged with [IN].3. **Sentence 3**: s  - The commenter mentions "our D" (defense) and "Moody	1671161765.0	49ers	seahawks	an_albino_rhino	:helmet2: 49ers	2.0	0.970275990664959	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

'he' in this context is likely referring to a member of the in-group team (a player, coach, etc.), making a strategic move. 'his defense' implicitly refers to the in-group's defense because the commenter is focused on their own team's tactical maneuvering. Given the high win probability of 73.3%, the Bears are performing well, which aligns with the tone of making a strategic call that led to a long timeout. Therefore, 'he' and 'his defense' should be tagged [IN].The second sentence talks about the timeout being beneficial, which could apply to a strategic rest period for the Bears' defense. Since there is no explicit new subject introduced, the second sentence logically continues referring to the same context established in the first sentence—the tactical decisions of the Bears.Therefore, 'he' and 'his defense' are referring to the in-group and deserve to be tagged [IN] accordingly.	The phrase 'he challenged' indicates a player or coach challenged something, likely on the in-group (Bears) side since the comment appears to be discussing an in-group action. The phrase 'his defense' is specifying the defensive unit related to this player or coach, further suggesting an in-group reference. The purpose of this challenge is stated as giving 'his defense' a break, reinforcing the idea that the commenter is referring to the Bears' defense. Therefore, 'he' and 'his defense' should be tagged [IN], aligning with the in-group. The second sentence provides additional context but does not include any specific entity references that would change this interpretation.	1633905865.0	bears	raiders	DeadBear911		1.0	0.7327286005020139	[5, 5]

This indicates the comment is about an in-group player. The directive for "Pat" to get rid of the ball is a critique commonly made by fans towards their own team's quarterback during moments of high pressure or poor performance. Given that the win probability is low, the commenter is likely expressing frustration with their team's performance. Therefore, "Pat" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter mentions "Pat," which refers to Patrick Mahomes, the quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Chiefs (in-group) and is giving advice or criticism specifically to a player on that team, "Pat" should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, the target tagging of "Pat" as [IN] is appropriate as it refers to an in-group entity.	1669001595.0	chiefs	chargers	Aggressive_Copy_9466		2.0	0.376690208911896	[5]

"We" is a common pronoun used by fans to refer to their own supported team, indicating affiliation with the in-group. Additionally, "O-line" (offensive line) is mentioned without any qualifying adjectives, which implies familiarity and a sense of ownership, characteristics of referring to the in-group team. Therefore, both "We" and "O-line" should be tagged as [IN], aligning with the in-group team the commenter supports. The rest of the comment does not contain any explicit entity references and is tagged as-is.	The commenter expresses disappointment with the performance of their team, indicated by the phrase "We ain't winning shit." The use of "We" suggests the commenter is a supporter of the in-group team, the Bills. Additionally, the criticism of the "O-line" (offensive line) is directed towards the in-group team's performance. Thus, "We" and "O-line" are tagged as [IN] since they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports, the Bills. The second sentence "Goodnight" is a separate farewell and does not refer to any specific entity.	1637894700.0	bills	saints	BillBearBaggins	22	2.0	0.9301872551441193	[5, 5]

['Diontae', 'Dudes']	[(13, 20), (30, 35)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is talking about Diontae Johnson, a player for the Steelers, which is their in-group team. The directive to "Bench Diontae" and the derogatory comment "Dudes ass" are criticisms directed towards Diontae Johnson. Since Diontae is a member of the in-group, 'Diontae' and 'Dudes' should be tagged as [IN]. Despite the relatively high win probability for the in-group, the commenter is focusing on a specific aspect or player that they are currently dissatisfied with. This demonstrates how individual performance critiques can occur irrespective of the overall game status.	The comment is addressing someone by name, which is likely a player the commenter feels they have more familiarity with, suggesting in-group. 'Diontae' is Diontae Johnson from the Steelers. The term 'Dudes' in the second sentence is referring back to 'Diontae' and continues the critique, implying familiarity and frustration typical of in-group negative comments. So both 'Diontae' and 'Dudes' should be tagged as [IN], reflecting the commenter's in-group team, the Steelers.	1669693545.0	steelers	colts	Rdp616		1.0	0.639960765838623	[5, 5]

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The high win probability suggests that the in-group team, the Eagles, is performing very well. The comment talks about the game sounding more like a home game, which typically means that the crowd is heavily in favor of the in-group team and creating a supportive atmosphere, thereby boosting their performance. Since this positive observation is made from the perspective of an Eagles' fan, and there are no explicit references to any team, the sentence can be implicitly tagged as referring to the in-group. Hence, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]', indicating the overall focus on the in-group team, the Eagles.	The comment is implicitly celebrating the atmosphere of a "home game," which suggests that the crowd noise or support is heavily in favor of the Eagles, the in-group team. Since there is no explicit mention of either the in-group or out-group, the entire sentence is referencing the in-group's positive reception. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged '[IN]' since the overall context and sentiment imply it is referring to the in-group, the Eagles.	1665350401.0	eagles	cardinals	Kuma_SSBM		2.0	0.9573881886899471	[5]

['we']	[(95, 97)]	['[IN]']	The phrase 'we' typically refers to the in-group, indicating the commenter is speaking about the team they support. Given the low win probability, the commenter is likely discussing a critical decision point for their team (the Eagles) and the potential negative outcome of not converting on fourth down. Thus, 'we' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the Eagles, the in-group team the commenter supports.

This phrase is commonly used by fans to express disappointment or frustration with their own team's performance. Given the low win probability, it implies that the Bears are performing poorly at the time of the comment. 1. "The Bears" refers to the in-group team and should be tagged [IN].2. "the fucking Bears" further emphasizes the same team and should also be tagged [IN].The second sentence, "What a shitshow," is a general expression of dismay directed at the situation, most likely implying the overall performance of the in-group team. However, as there is no explicit reference, it doesn't get a specific tag.Thus, 'The Bears' and 'the fucking Bears' are correctly tagged as [IN], and the comment correctly reflects the frustration of a Bears fan.	The commenter is clearly discussing the Bears, the in-group team they support. Both references to "The Bears" and "the fucking Bears" are criticism directly aimed at their own team. Fans often talk this way about their in-group team when they are disappointed or upset with their performance. Therefore, both instances of "The Bears" should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence "What a shitshow." does not explicitly mention a team but given the frustrated tone, it's implied that the commenter is still talking about the in-group, supporting the relationship between the sentences.	1634495669.0	bears	packers	sedatemenow	GSH	2.0	0.268745362758636	[5, 5]

Butker is the kicker for the Chiefs, and the commenter's concern about him being hurt implies that 'Butker' should be tagged as [IN]. The use of "we" in the context of game strategy ("maybe we just run out the time here"), also indicates the commenter's perspective as part of the in-group, thus "we" should be tagged as [IN]. Despite the high win probability, the commenter is discussing strategy due to the injury of an important player, which is typical for a fan of the in-group team.	The commenter is likely a Chiefs supporter, as indicated by their concern over Butker, a player for the Chiefs, being hurt. 'Butker' is a specific reference to the in-group's player and should be tagged with [IN]. The use of 'we' suggests a collective identification with the Chiefs, and thus 'we' should also be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1662932839.0	chiefs	cardinals	uwanmirrondarrah	Patrick Mahomes #2	1.0	0.9660195112228394	[5, 5]

The comment is discussing game strategy and decisions, typical of a fan scrutinizing their own team's performance. Furthermore, in the context of a tight game (with a win probability of 38.9% indicating they are trailing but still in it), it makes sense to be talking about critical game decisions by their team. Consequently, the pronoun 'He' in the second sentence likely refers to someone like the Ravens' coach or quarterback making the calls, thus also referring to the in-group. Since there's no explicit mention of the team in the last sentence but it's a continuation of the same thought process, it implies that the pass concepts relate to the in-group as well. This results in tagging the pronoun 'He' and the general 'pass concepts' in the third sentence as [IN]. Therefore, 'we', 'we' and 'He' should be tagged [IN], and the last sentence, which implicitly refers to the in-group's strategy, should also be implicitly tagged [IN] altogether.

The use of "we" in the first sentence indicates a reference to the in-group, as fans typically use "we" to mean their own team. Similarly, "we" in the second sentence again refers to the in-group team, the Ravens. "He" in the third sentence is likely referring to the Ravens' coach or quarterback who is responsible for the decision to call three passes, reinforcing it is directed at the in-group. In the final sentence, the commentary is about the decisions made by the in-group team, so the full sentence is tagged as [IN] even though there is no explicit mention of the team or a player.	1673836501.0	ravens	bengals	Von_Huge1103	 :OLD3: 	3.0	0.38935607671737704	[5, 5, 5, 5]

['THE JETE']	[(12, 20)]	['[OUT]']	The commenter is a supporter of the Bills, as indicated by the in-group. The phrase "BEAT THE JETE" expresses a desire for the Bills to defeat the Jets in this game. Given the context, "THE JETE" is a derogatory way of referring to the Jets, making it clear this is directed at the out-group opponent. There is no other explicit reference to either team in the second sentence, "P. S. FTP," which can be a general statement that isn't referring to any specific team in this context. The win probability of 93.6% indicates that the Bills are likely winning, supporting the confident and somewhat taunting nature of the comment.Thus, 'THE JETE' should be tagged [OUT], and there should be no in-group, out-group, or other tags in the second sentence. This explains why the target output correctly tags the phrases and sentences as indicated.	The comment is expressing a desire to see the Jets defeated. 'JETE' is likely a playful misspelling or a mocking shorthand for the 'Jets', which the commenter wants to see beaten. Since the Jets are the out-group opponent team in this context, 'THE JETE' should be tagged as [OUT]. The second sentence 'P. S. FTP.' does not have any specific entity that directly relates to this in-group/out-group context, hence it remains untagged.	1641763420.0	bills	jets	Leucas_Poopus		4.0	0.936112582683563	[5]

['BG', 'they']	[(100, 102), (133, 137)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment exhibits frustration likely from an Eagles fan as inferred from the low win probability of 2.3%, indicating that the team is almost certain to lose the game. This fan uses 'you' and 'you blow it' attributing blame to the in-group team. The expression 'BG' likely refers to an in-group player or entity (possibly Brandon Graham, an Eagles player), and thus is tagged [IN]. Given the context of 'Fuck BG', it reflects disappointment or anger towards that player or entity, reinforcing the assumption of an in-group reference under distress. Additionally, 'they' refers to the in-group team (Eagles) when stating 'It's not the reason they lost,' signifying blame directed towards the team, aligning with the frustrated tone commonly seen among fans of the losing team. Thus, 'BG' and 'they' correctly denote in-group entities.	The sentence "You have a chance to win a game and you blow it" suggests frustration over the in-group team (Eagles) failing to capitalize on a winning opportunity. "Fuck BG" refers to BG, a player likely on the in-group team, expressing frustration towards him. The phrase "It's not the reason they lost but it's one of them" is discussing the in-group team as a whole, suggested by the context of the previous sentences. Therefore, 'BG' and 'they' are correctly tagged with [IN].	1668485275.0	eagles	washington	JD021993	Go Iggles.	-1.0	0.0233372449874878	[5, 5]

'WE' is written in all caps, emphasizing the commenter and possibly other fans' recognition of a particular issue or strategy that the team should adopt. 'Andy' refers to Andy Dalton, who is a quarterback for the Saints, and 'the coaches' refers to the coaching staff of the Saints. The comment is about getting the in-group team's player and coaching staff to align with the fans' perspective. Therefore, 'Andy and the coaches' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to entities associated with the in-group team the commenter supports (Saints).	The phrase "Andy and the coaches" likely refers to Andy Dalton, who is a quarterback for the New Orleans Saints, and the Saints coaching staff. Since the in-group team the commenter supports is the Saints, referencing an in-group player and its coaching staff fits the context of trying to get their own team better. Thus, "Andy and the coaches" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1670297288.0	saints	buccaneers	warmachine2412	Fuck the Falcons	1.0	0.922637403011322	[5]

Understanding and correctly tagging references to the teams and players is crucial for determining which group the commenter is talking about.  In the first sentence, "Steelers" refers to the out-group team and should be tagged [OUT]. "Kenny" refers to the Steelers' quarterback Kenny Pickett, making it also out-group ([OUT]). The reference to "rare stop on 3rd down" indicates this stop was notable, possibly made by the Colts, so "Kenny stop on 3rd down" implies the in-group defense stopped him.- In the second sentence, "Ryan" refers to Matt Ryan, the Colts' quarterback, making it an in-group reference ([IN]). "Wentz-esq" refers to Carson Wentz, a former player for the in-group team and draws a comparison from an in-group situation, but here it is used to describe a pick that mirrors Wentz's style, potentially making it referential to the out-group performance ([OUT]). However, since both Wentz and Ryan are associated with the Colts, it could be argued that it remains [IN] due to context.- In the third sentence, "Y	The comment consists of multiple sentences describing different events in the game. 1. The first sentence mentions "Steelers moved easily down the field," which means the Steelers, the opponent team, are being described as having a good drive, thus "Steelers" should be tagged [OUT]. The mention of "Kenny" (referring to Kenny Pickett, a Steelers player) stopping the drive on 3rd down should also be tagged [OUT], while the rare stop refers to the in-group (Colts) defense, so "stop" should be implicitly [IN].2. The second sentence states that "Ryan promptly threw a Wentz-esq pick." "Ryan" here refers to Matt Ryan, the quarterback of the Colts, thus it should be tagged [IN]. "Wentz-esq" refers to Carson Wentz, a former NFL quarterback often criticized for interceptions; he does not belong to either group for this game, but the pick itself is detrimental to the in-group (Colts), so Wentz should be tagged [OUT].3.

The context of the comment suggests a collective sentiment that the commenter shares with other fans of the in-group team. Given the high win probability of 83.2% for the Packers, the commenter's use of "We" implies a discussion rooted in the experiences or perceptions of the Packers fanbase. Therefore, "We" should be tagged with [IN], and since there are no other specific entities mentioned that need tagging, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team.	The word "We" typically refers to the in-group, particularly when used among fans talking about their own team. It indicates that the commenter is identifying with the Packers, the team they support.

It is common for fans to praise their in-group team when it is performing well. There is no explicit mention of a player or team in the comment, but given the context and win probability, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is talking about the in-group team. Thus, the entire sentence is tagged with [IN].	The lack of any explicit qualification or negative connotation suggests the commenter is complimenting a player for a good performance, likely from the in-group they support. Fans generally make positive comments about their own team, so the comment implicitly refers to the in-group, which in this case is the Packers. Therefore, the sentence should be tagged [IN] as referring to the in-group implicitly, even though no specific word or phrase directly references the team.	1641176855.0	packers	vikings	zinski1990KB1		1.0	0.930174052715302	[5]

The usage of "we" is a common in-group reference, indicating the commenter sees themselves as part of the Vikings group. The context implies the commenter's focus on the in-group's performance and potential, regardless of a relatively balanced win probability. Therefore, both instances of "we" are tagged with [IN], since they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The use of "we" in the sentence indicates the commenter is referring to their own team, the in-group. Fans typically use "we" to talk about their own team. The statement suggests the team needs to improve and has the potential to perform well, indicating a critique and expectation that is usually directed towards the team they support.

The win probability is relatively high, indicating the team is currently doing well, but the tone suggests frustration over a common pattern where they fall behind and then have to recover. The sentence does not explicitly mention the in-group team, but the context suggests that the commenter is referring to the Ravens, thus the whole sentence should be tagged with [IN], represented by the '[SENT]' tag.	The comment seems to express a sentiment of expectation and irony about a recurring event, likely from the perspective of a Ravens fan. The term "weekly comeback" indicates a pattern that the commenter is familiar with, which suggests they are likely referring to their own team's habit of staging comebacks. Since there's no explicit phrase naming the in-group team, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged as referring to the in-group [IN], based on the context and the likely disappointment or sarcasm about their own team's performance.	1670791179.0	ravens	steelers	caldawggy13		3.0	0.746807120461657	[5]

Since it does not specify which team's defense is being referred to and the commenter is a supporter of the Giants, it is reasonable to infer that 'This defense' refers to the Giants' defense. The win probability being low suggests that the Giants might not be performing well at this moment, which aligns with the complaint about bad defense. Thus, 'This defense' should be tagged [IN], indicating it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The phrase "this defense" is likely referring to the defense of the in-group team (Giants) since the comment is critical of the defense without specifying it as belonging to the out-group (Washington). Fans typically refer to their own team's performance when expressing frustration or disappointment in an unspecified manner. Therefore, "this defense" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group. The '[SENT]' token is tagged [IN] since this sentence, although not explicitly mentioning the in-group, is implicitly referring to the in-group's performance.	1631848603.0	giants	washington	dbr255		2.0	0.436246693134308	[5]

Despite the high win probability, the commenter is expressing frustration about the team's inability to finish games properly. This type of critical comment is commonly directed toward in-group teams by their supporters, evidenced here by the mention of 'chargers'. Therefore, 'chargers' should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to the in-group team.	The comment is expressing frustration with the Chargers' inability to finish games, indicating that it is from the perspective of a Chargers fan. Since the Chargers are the in-group team the commenter supports, the term "chargers" should be tagged with [IN]. Thus, 'chargers' is correctly identified as referring to the in-group.	1664738883.0	chargers	texans	boltup1987	bolt	1.0	0.872247159404425	[5]

The mention of his name here suggests a comparison to his renowned skills without it applying to the current in-group or out-group players. Therefore, 'Devin Hester' is correctly tagged as [OTHER] since he belongs to neither the in-group nor the out-group.	Devin Hester is a known player associated with the Chicago Bears, a team that is neither the in-group (Packers) nor the out-group (Vikings).

The win probability is very high for the in-group, suggesting they are in a favorable position, which might explain a casual or dismissive comment about their own player. Since Butker is part of the in-group team the commenter supports, 'Butker' should be tagged as [IN].	'Butker' refers to Harrison Butker, a player for the Chiefs, which is the in-group team. The commenter seems to be either questioning or belittling the player's performance, something they might do more critically since it's their own team's player. Therefore, 'Butker' should be tagged with [IN].	1662929434.0	chiefs	cardinals	BebbleCast	#5	2.0	0.9299934133887291	[5]

This situation implies dissatisfaction with the in-group team, given it triggered such a reaction, even though the win probability is reasonably favorable. This comment does not contain explicit mentions of the in-group but clearly identifies the Browns, the opponent team, leading to tagging 'the Browns' as [OUT]. The emotional context and causal relationship indicated by 'when the Browns scored' help in determining the team referenced. 'the Browns' should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the out-group opposing team.	The phrase 'the Browns' explicitly refers to the out-group team (Browns), and it is tagged as [OUT]. The commenter expresses disgust when the out-group scored, which they wouldn't typically do if it were the in-group. Therefore, 'the Browns' should be tagged as [OUT], and the rest of the sentence implicitly refers to the out-group's actions and the commenter's reaction, making the specific tagging listed appropriate.	1663531752.0	jets	browns	FinntheHue	:PlayerQuinnenSmile: Bless Ya, Thank Ya	6.0	0.591695874929428	[5]

The commenter expresses happiness for AJ Green, indicating a positive sentiment towards an in-group player in a moment that is important (as reflected in the high win probability hinting at a favorable game state). Therefore, 'AJ Green' should be tagged as [IN] because he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports. The second sentence lacks explicit reference to an individual or team but implicitly refers back to the in-group in the context of needing a positive outcome, hence '[SENT]' is tagged [IN].	AJ Green is a player for the in-group team, the Cardinals. Since the commenter is happy for AJ Green, it implies that AJ Green has done something good or important for the in-group team that the commenter supports. Therefore, 'AJ Green' should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, 'Needed that badly' implies a positive event related to the in-group team, but since there are no explicit entities being referred to, it doesn't need additional tags, plus 'that' refers to AJ Green's action in the prior sentence.	1632089247.0	cardinals	vikings	notouchmypeterson	:hop: Hail Mary	10.0	0.609668642282486	[5]

Given the high win probability, it is in line with a fan's perspective trying to push their team to secure the win. 'Mason' refers to Mason Crosby, a Packers player, and 'blockers' refers to the offensive line players of the Packers who are responsible for blocking. Therefore, both 'Mason' and 'blockers' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group team.	The commenter is urging both Mason and the blockers to improve their performance. Since Mason Crosby is the kicker for the Packers, the comment is directed at the in-group's player and their blockers.

The term "us" refers to the in-group, the Bills, as fans often use "us" or "we" to refer to the team they support. Therefore, "us" should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter refers to 'the chiefs', which are neither the Bills (in-group) nor the Bears (out-group), so 'the chiefs' should be tagged as [OTHER].

The use of "our" clearly signals that the commenter is referring to the Packers, the team they support. Therefore, "our Defense" should be tagged with [IN] because it explicitly refers to the in-group team's defense, suggesting that they might be performing well in the game.	The commenter uses the possessive "our Defense," which indicates a reference to the in-group team they support, in this case, the Packers.

Despite the relatively high win probability, the commenter is focused on a bad moment or performance from their team. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Buccaneers.	The comment is complaining about a team's poor performance, which is something a supporter is more likely to do about their own team rather than the opponent. Given that the commenter supports the Buccaneers, it is reasonable to infer that 'they' refers to the in-group team.

This pronoun usage indicates that the commenter is referring to the Falcons since "we" signifies a collective reference including themselves with the Falcons. The comment is likely trying to downplay a potentially negative outcome (having to punt), which is a typical response fans give when attempting to maintain or encourage a calmer, more rational perspective among other supporters of their team. The win probability being relatively close to 50% supports the idea that the game is still competitive, hence the calming remarks. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] as it directly refers to the in-group team, the Falcons.	The phrase 'we' usually refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, in this case, the Falcons. The commenter is trying to calm the supporters, indicating they are part of the same group, which is the Falcons.

The comment mentions "many people on this sub" which implies that the commenter is speaking within a community of like-minded people, commonly fans of the same team, hence the in-group. Although the comment doesn't explicitly mention the Patriots, it is reasonable to infer that "people on this sub" are Patriots fans. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN] since the subforum presumably refers to the Patriots community.	The term 'this sub' refers to a subreddit or online discussion forum for fans, and is implicitly related to the community of the in-group team the commenter supports, in this case, the Patriots. The use of 'many people on this sub' indicates a shared sentiment among fellow fans. Therefore, although there is no explicit word or phrase referring directly to the in-group, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group community and '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	1673204479.0	patriots	bills	crazyfoxxy		2.0	0.13952404260635398	[5]

[SENT] I 'd rather have the ball at 1:50 and two timeout than 2:10 and 1 timeout . 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The comment discusses a strategic decision involving the use of a timeout, which is most likely a critique of the in-group team's coaching decisions, given the common emotional investment fans have in their team's play-calling and time management. The commenter does not explicitly mention the Vikings or Cardinals, but given the context, it's reasonable to assume that they are questioning the choices made by their own team's coaching staff, especially when the win probability is relatively low, indicating a tense or losing situation. The comment is implicitly about the in-group, thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since there is no explicit word/phrase that refers to the in-group, but the comment is referring to the in-group implicitly.	The comment is expressing frustration with a strategic decision, likely made by the in-group team. The lack of critique or any reference directed towards the out-group suggests the commenter's displeasure is with their own team's use of timeouts. Fans typically complain about coaching or player decisions when referring to their own team rather than the opponent, given the personal investment in their team's performance. Therefore, since there is no explicit mention of a team or player in the second sentence, it is implicitly referring to the in-group team. '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to acknowledge the implicit reference to the in-group team, indicating the commenter's dissatisfaction with their in-group team's decision-making.	1632092932.0	vikings	cardinals	twinsguy1		2.0	0.39563715457916304	[5]

Given that the in-group team is the Steelers, Sutton is likely a player for the in-group team. The high win probability of 75.7% further suggests that the team is doing well, and thus the praise would be directed at an in-group player. Therefore, 'sutton' is tagged as [IN] because he is a player for the team the commenter supports.	Sutton is a player for the Steelers, the in-group team. The phrase "heck of a play" is usually praise directed towards a player the commenter supports, implying that Sutton is being recognized for a good action on the field.

[IN] If you do n't have the leg to make 54 yards , you 're not an NFL kicker . 	['[SENT]']	[(15, 21)]	['[IN]']	The exclamation "Yikes." in the first sentence is a reaction commonly used in response to something negative or surprising happening in the game, which suggests that something unfavorable occurred. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the subject of this sentence directly, so '[SENT]' remains untagged. The second sentence implies criticism of a kicker who failed to make a 54-yard field goal. Given the low win probability of 13.8%, it is likely the commenter is criticizing a player on the in-group team, the Jaguars, for missing the kick. Hence, the criticism about not having the leg to make a 54-yard field goal would be targeted at an in-group player, implicating '[SENT]' to be tagged with [IN] for implicitly referring to the Jaguars in the context of this underperformance.	The comment "Yikes. If you don't have the leg to make 54 yards, you're not an NFL kicker." expresses disappointment or concern, likely directed at the in-group team, the Jaguars. The use of "you" and "you're" is a general statement but is likely directed at the in-group kicker who missed the kick, given that fans typically direct their frustrations or criticisms toward their own team's performance. Therefore, the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group. So, the first sentence doesn't explicitly refer to any team, but the second sentence implicitly refers to the in-group due to the criticism regarding a failed field goal attempt. Thus, tagging the second sentence as [IN] is appropriate.Elapsed:	1633889353.0	jaguars	titans	Rickety-Cricket	:slash1::slash2:	22.0	0.137992918491364	[5]

['McKinnon']	[(65, 73)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is suggesting an alternative offensive strategy, specifically mentioning the screen game with a player named McKinnon. Jerrick McKinnon is a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, who are the in-group team the commenter supports. Despite the win probability being relatively high, the commenter is focused on improving their team's performance. There is no mention of the out-group (Bengals) in the comment. Therefore, McKinnon should be tagged [IN], indicating that he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter is suggesting a strategy adjustment for the in-group team, the Chiefs. McKinnon is a player on the Chiefs, meaning they are advocating for the use of a player from their own team. Thus, 'McKinnon' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group entity, and the rest of the sentence remains neutral without any bias towards the opposing team.	1675046429.0	chiefs	bengals	h2ohydration		1.0	0.639229714870453	[5]

Joe Burrow is a key player for the Bengals, which is the out-group team in this context since the commenter supports the Ravens. The phrase 'That for sure would have been called on Burrow' implies a sense of unfairness or favoritism towards the out-group, which fans often feel when a call benefits an opposing star player. Despite the relatively low win probability for the Ravens, the comment is directly mentioning Burrow from the Bengals. Hence, 'Burrow' should be tagged with [OUT] because it refers to the out-group.	The comment mentions "Burrow," who is the quarterback for the Bengals, the out-group opponent team. Since the commenter is a Ravens supporter, they would refer to an opponent player, such as Burrow, in a situation that implies a missed call. This indicates that the comment is about the out-group. Therefore, "Burrow" is tagged with [OUT].	1673834427.0	ravens	bengals	Gumboy52	80	13.0	0.18021957576274905	[5]

The commenter is likely frustrated with Goff's performance, specifically mentioning his tendency to make short, safe passes (check-downs). This context, paired with the mention of returning to a certain pattern of play, indicates that the commenter is criticizing a player from their own team, the Lions. Thus, "Goof" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	The commenter is likely referring to Jared Goff, a quarterback for the Lions, derogatorily calling him "Goof". Since Jared Goff is a member of the Lions, the tagged [IN] is appropriate. The word "Goof" is the expression directly referencing the in-group player and should be tagged with [IN]. Therefore, the comment implicitly criticizing Goff's play is about the in-group team, and "Goof" should be tagged as referring to the in-group entity.	1662917315.0	lions	eagles	CallMeKeegs		-4.0	0.436793386936188	[5]

Here's why the specific tags are correct:1. The first sentence is neutral and doesn't mention any team or player specifically, so no tags are needed.2. 'He' in the second sentence implicitly refers to a player on the Commanders because the commenter, being a Commanders supporter, would likely be discussing one of their players, especially given the win probability of 9.2% which implies a disappointing performance and frustration with their own team.3. 'them' refers to the Commanders' coaching staff or media who were hyping up the player during the off-season, thus tagged as in-group.4. 'him' again refers to the same Commanders' player being discussed, thus marked as in-group.Therefore, the tags indicate that the commenter is disappointed with an in-group player based on the context and low win probability, which aligns the tags with how fans discuss their own team's shortcomings.	The comment expresses a disappointment about a player's performance, juxtaposed with pre-season hype. Fans typically discuss their own team's players with such detail, especially when expectations are not met. The absence of an explicit team reference in the first sentence and the subsequent discussion about the runner suggests an in-group focus. - '[SENT]' in the first sentence is not explicitly connected to a team, so it is left unchanged.- 'He' in the second sentence likely refers to a player from the commenter's team (Commanders), thus tagged [IN].- 'them' refers to the same team's coaching staff or fans who were hyping the player, thus also tagged [IN].- 'him' refers back to 'He', the same in-group player who was hyped, and thus tagged [IN]. The commenter is referring to a player from their own team, discussing how he's not lived up to the pre-season hype. Therefore, 'He' is tagged [IN], 'them' refers to the in-group (Commanders' staff or fans), thus tagged [IN], and 'him' refers back to the same in-group player, tagged [IN].	1668478183.0	commanders	eagles	notorious_hdc	imitated Frerotte headbutt as a child	1.0	0.09222000837326005	[5, 5, 5]

'DK' refers to DK Metcalf, a player for the Seahawks, thus should be tagged [IN]. The in-group team is evidently assigned credit (or blame) for Ramsey's performance, with distinctions made for individual player performances, reinforcing these labels for the mentioned players.	The commenter is discussing the performance of several players with respect to the Seahawks (in-group) and the Rams (out-group). 'RW' refers to Russell Wilson, a player on the Seahawks, thus it should be tagged '[IN]'. 'Ramsey' refers to Jalen Ramsey, a player on the Rams, thus it should be tagged '[OUT]'. The pronoun 'he' in this context is referring back to 'Ramsey', so it should also be tagged '[OUT]'. 'DK' refers to DK Metcalf, a player on the Seahawks, hence this should be tagged '[IN]'.

Since the Commanders have a low win probability, they are likely struggling. The use of 'garbage' suggests the commenter is criticizing a player from their own team, which is common when fans are frustrated in such situations. Therefore, 'Jackson' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to a member of the in-group team (Commanders).	The commenter is likely referring to an in-group player using a critical tone. "Jackson" is identified as a member of the Commanders (in-group) since fans typically direct strong, unfiltered criticism towards their own team or players. Thus, "Jackson" should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to the in-group.	1634491928.0	commanders	washington	Snakeyes805		3.0	0.120837688446045	[4]

The phrase 'holding it down' suggests a positive performance, aligning with the very high win probability of 100% for the in-group, indicating the Ravens are performing well. Therefore, 'AA' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Ravens.	'AA' is likely an abbreviation or nickname for a player on the in-group team, the Ravens. The phrase "holding it down" implies that the player is performing well, which fans typically highlight when discussing their own team's players. Therefore, 'AA' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	1634499355.0	ravens	chargers	Hyuga10		3.0	0.999983326459187	[5]

[SENT] [IN] 's way more decisive than [IN] 	['He', 'Winston']	[(20, 22), (49, 56)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment refers to a comparison between two players, where 'He' is considered to be more decisive than 'Winston'. Given the context that the in-group is the Saints, and knowing that Jameis Winston is a player for the Saints, it is logical to assume that 'He' also refers to another player within the Saints. This kind of comparison is typical in discussions regarding in-group team performance and player evaluations. Since both entities being compared are from the in-group team that the commenter supports, 'He' and 'Winston' should be tagged with [IN]. Thus, the comment reflects a critique or evaluation within the in-group, focusing on the players of the Saints.	The comment is comparing two players, and since there's no reference to the out-group (Vikings), it's reasonable to assume both players mentioned are from the in-group (Saints). The statement evaluates the decisiveness of 'He' in comparison to 'Winston', and critique or praise of players typically falls under discussions about the in-group. Therefore, both 'He' and 'Winston' should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1664718901.0	saints	vikings	Mc_4321		2.0	0.180066868662834	[5, 5]

'brooks' refers to Jordyn Brooks, a linebacker in the Seahawks, who just got 'trucked,' meaning he was overpowered in a play. This kind of detailed commentary is typical of a fan discussing their own team. Additionally, the commenter expresses a desire for 'kj' to be back, referring to K.J. Wright, another player for the Seahawks. This longing for K.J. Wright to return implies a strong in-group connection. Hence, 'brooks' and 'kj' should be tagged [IN], as they are both referring to players on the in-group team, the Seahawks.	The commenter is talking about Brooks, a player from the in-group Seahawks, getting trucked, meaning he got knocked down forcefully. This is a critique of an in-group player's performance. The commenter then expresses a desire to have KJ back, likely referring to KJ Wright, a former Seahawks player. Given this context, 'brooks' and 'kj' are both players associated with the in-group Seahawks, so they should be tagged [IN], as the comment is solely focused on entities related to the Seahawks.	1637537566.0	seahawks	cardinals	yeahthatsumsitup		2.0	0.222266435623169	[5, 5]

The Packers are the in-group team, and since the comment expresses concern over Adams being hurt, it is clearly referring to an in-group player in a sympathetic manner. Therefore, 'Adams' should be tagged [IN].	The commenter expresses concern using 'Oh no', which implies a connection or sympathy often associated with the in-group team.

This type of sentiment is typical of fans discussing their own team's players, particularly in the context of disappointment and frustration. Despite the 100% win probability indicating a sure win for the 49ers, fans often focus on specific player developments and long-term team progress, not just individual game outcomes. Therefore, "him" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a player within the in-group, the 49ers.	The comment reflects the disappointment of the commenter regarding a player's development. The phrase 'I was so excited for him to develop this year' suggests the commenter had high expectations for an in-group player. The complaint about it being 'just another waiting game' further suggests this disappointment is related to a player whose development is personally significant to the commenter, which would be an in-group player. Therefore, 'him' should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to a player from the in-group team.	1664163699.0	49ers	broncos	J_Arab	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	6.0	1.0	[5]

The exclamation 'FUCK YEAH !!!!' is a celebratory expression, which fans usually shout when their team is doing well. Since there is no explicit mention of the in-group, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] to capture the implicit reference to the in-group team.	The comment 'FUCK YEAH !!!!' is an expression of strong positive emotion, typically indicating that something good happened for the team the commenter supports. Since the in-group is the Bills, the excitement is very likely due to a positive event involving the Bills. The '[SENT]' token is tagged with '[IN]' as there are no explicit words/phrases referring to the in-group, but the sentiment is directed towards the in-group team the commenter is a fan of.	1665963029.0	bills	chiefs	Whyisthereasnake	:hamlin:	2.0	0.991523027420044	[5]

The win probability is low, indicating the Commanders are likely losing, and this comment is criticizing a specific player on their team. Often, fans will critique specific players within in-group team comments, and here, 'Bostic' is being criticized for his routine errors. Thus 'Bostic' should be tagged [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team.	Bostic is mentioned in a critical context and since there is no indication he is from the out-group, it is reasonable to infer he is a player from the in-group (Commanders). The negative commentary about his performance suggests the commenter is focusing criticism on their own team, which is a common behavior for fans discussing in-group players. Thus, 'Bostic' should be tagged as [IN].	1632677401.0	commanders	bills	Untuchablelemur	:R1:	2.0	0.11179119348526001	[5]

This celebratory tone is appropriate given the relatively high win probability for the Chargers at the time of the comment. As both players mentioned are part of the in-group team, "Herbert Sherbet" and "Mike Will" should be tagged as [IN]. This demonstrates the positive way fans often refer to their own team's players, especially when they are doing well.	The comment utilizes playful language to celebrate players from the in-group team, the Chargers. 'Herbert Sherbet' is a humorous reference to Justin Herbert, the Chargers' quarterback, and 'Mike Will' refers to Mike Williams, a Chargers wide receiver. Given this context, 'Herbert Sherbet' and 'Mike Will' should both be tagged with [IN], as they refer to well-known in-group players. The commenter, being a Chargers supporter, is expressing enjoyment related to these players.	1633899062.0	chargers	browns	AngelicRock		3.0	0.625327516346014	[5, 5]

[SENT] How tf does that work ????? 	['san fran']	[(11, 19)]	['[OUT]']	The commenter is expressing frustration about a situation that benefits the out-group team, the 49ers. The first sentence mentions "san fran," which is a colloquial term for San Francisco, the city represented by the 49ers. This indicates that the commenter is referring to the out-group when they mention "san fran." The other sentences in the comment do not explicitly mention any team or player but continue the discussion about a turn of events that likely negatively impacts the in-group (Eagles), given the very low win probability of 1.8% for the in-group. This frustration and focus on a positive outcome for the opponent confirm that "san fran" should be tagged [OUT], with the other sentences implicitly discussing the scenario involving the out-group. Thus "san fran" should be tagged [OUT].	'san fran' refers to the San Francisco 49ers, which is the out-group team in this context. The comment expresses frustration and disbelief that the opposing team, 'san fran', has regained possession, a situation an in-group supporter would likely be displeased about. Therefore, 'san fran' should be tagged as [OUT], reflecting its reference to the out-group team. There are no other explicit referring expressions in the other sentences, which are general expressions of disbelief and confusion about the situation.	1632080417.0	eagles	49ers			4.0	0.0184789299964905	[5]

['Trent Irwin', 'Dude']	[(7, 18), (62, 66)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is clearly excited about Trent Irwin, indicating he is a player on the in-group team, the Bengals. The enthusiasm suggested by "Hell yea" further implies a positive sentiment towards Irwin. Additionally, the statement "Dude can catch" is praising his abilities, which aligns with the commenter supporting him as an in-group player. Therefore, "Trent Irwin" should be tagged [IN] since he's a part of the in-group team, and "Dude" should also be tagged [IN] as it refers to the same player. Given the 100% win probability, it implies that the in-group team is certain to win, which provides context for the positive tone of the comment. Thus, both "Trent Irwin" and "Dude" being tagged as [IN] is consistent with the context and sentiments of the commentary.	The comment expresses excitement and approval about Trent Irwin being on the field and his ability to catch, which indicates a positive sentiment towards him. Since the in-group team is the Bengals, it is reasonable to assume that Trent Irwin is a player for the Bengals. The enthusiasm and positive assessment ("Hell yea," "Dude can catch") are indicative of a fan's support for their own team's player. Consequently, 'Trent Irwin' and 'Dude' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to a member of the in-group team.	1667262235.0	bengals	browns	FTSBengals		3.0	1.0	[5, 5]

The commenter is reflecting on a high level of optimism generated by a past performance ('after that game'), a sentiment typically held about the team one supports. The win probability is relatively high, indicating that the in-group is performing well at the moment. So, 'we' should be tagged as [IN] since it is referring to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The use of "we" indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, which in this case is the Ravens. Fans typically use "we" to refer to their team when expressing hopes, disappointments, or reactions to a game. This statement reflects the commenter's belief that the Ravens were performing at a level high enough to win the Super Bowl after a particular game, implying pride and optimism in their in-group team.

Considering that fans are more likely to criticize their own players, especially when the team is not performing well (as indicated by the low win probability of 25.0%), it's reasonable to conclude that Bradbury is a player for the in-group team, the Vikings. Therefore, 'Bradbury' should be tagged with [IN].	Garrett Bradbury is a player for the Minnesota Vikings. Since the commenter is disparaging Bradbury and the in-group team is the Vikings, it makes sense for a Vikings fan to criticize one of their own players.

The commenter suggests letting Thibodeaux play quarterback for the rest of the game, indicating frustration or admiration for his performance. Given the context, "Thibs" and "he" should be tagged as [IN] because they refer to an in-group player. Despite the win probability being quite balanced, the comment does not mention any players from the out-group team, Washington. Thus, both "Thibs" and "he" are correctly tagged as [IN], referring to a Giants player the commenter is referring to positively.	The commenter is suggesting that "Thibs" (Thibodeaux), a Giants player, should play quarterback for the rest of the game, which indicates a familiarity and support for the player, implying he is part of the in-group. Thus, "Thibs" should be tagged with [IN]. In the second sentence, the phrase "he" also refers to the same player, Thibodeaux, and should be tagged with [IN] as well. This fits the context of a fan talking positively about an in-group player.	1671415449.0	giants	washington	LFCReds8		4.0	0.49310085535649995	[5, 5]

The commenter is defending Darius Leonard and highlighting the few defenders who are making significant plays, indicating they are praising their in-group team. The win probability of 96.4% means the team is likely doing very well, aligning with the positive sentiment towards these players. As such, 'Darius,' 'Buckner,' and 'Kenny Moore' should be tagged as [IN] since they all refer to members of the in-group team. Each phrase refers back to the context of the in-group (Colts), which is why they are correctly tagged as [IN]. 'Who talks shit on Darius' is implicitly supportive, further reinforcing that Darius belongs to the in-group.	The commenter appears to be defending players from their own team, indicating a critique or discussion about their defensive players. Given this context, 'Darius', 'Buckner', and 'Kenny Moore' are all players from the Colts (the in-group). Fans typically discuss their own team's players in this manner, especially when defending them or highlighting their performance.

The comment discusses a specific play that went wrong, which is typically analyzed critically by fans. 'he' in this context is likely referring to the in-group quarterback who overthrew a pass, and 'a guy' refers to an in-group receiver who was open in the flat. Fans often critique their own team's plays when they go wrong, aligning 'he' and 'a guy' with the in-group team, the Packers. Thus, 'he' and 'a guy' should be tagged with [IN], as they refer to the in-group team.	The commenter is likely discussing the performance of the in-group (Packers) since they are analyzing a specific play in detail, which is more typical of a fan discussing their own team. 'he' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group's quarterback who made the overthrow. 'a guy' should also be tagged [IN] since it refers to another player from the in-group who was open in the flat.

The term 'These refs' therefore refers to a neutral party, tagged as [OTHER], as the refs are not directly affiliated with any team. This neutral criticism is independent of the win probability, which is almost 50/50, indicating a close game. Despite this, the referees are always considered a separate entity and should be tagged as such.	'Refs' or 'referees' usually function as neutral arbiters in a game. They aren't associated with either the in-group or the out-group. In the context of the comment, the blame on referees often signifies frustration with perceived poor decision-making that affects the game without being directly tied to any team. Hence, 'These refs' should be tagged as [OTHER] since it is neither referring to the Steelers (in-group) nor the Raiders (out-group).	1632073626.0	steelers	raiders	JaysonLloyd	:sc::c3::c9::sc: Minkah Fitzpatrick	5.0	0.466029763221741	[5]

The second sentence, "Bend and then break them with Vita Vea," uses "them" to refer to the opponent team, aiming to describe a strategy to break down the out-group team (Packers). "Vita Vea" is a player for the Buccaneers, making this a reference to an in-group player. While "Bend and then break" does not explicitly identify the opponent team, the phrase "break them" makes it clear that it's referring to the out-group team, properly tagged [OUT]. Given the implicit references and context, the first phrase is tagged with [IN] for in-group defense, "them" is tagged with [OUT] for the Packers, and "Vita Vea" is tagged with [IN] to denote the Buccaneers' player.	The comment appears to be discussing the strategy of the in-group team (Buccaneers) and how they approach their defense ('The classic defense'). The first sentence should be tagged with [IN] since it talks about the team's classic defensive strategy implicitly, hence no explicit referring expression is needed. In the second sentence, 'them' likely refers to the out-group team (Packers), so it should be tagged with [OUT]. Vita Vea is a well-known player for the Buccaneers, so his name should be tagged with [IN].	1664141236.0	buccaneers	packers	ImDeputyDurland	:RedJersey13: Mike Evans	6.0	0.200688555836678	[5, 5, 5]

['Rodgers']	[(66, 73)]	['[OUT]']	The win probability for the in-group Packers is extremely low, indicating they are likely losing the game. Aaron Rodgers is a quarterback for the Packers, but given the context, "dropping Rodgers" could imply the commenter is reflecting on their fantasy football decision rather than the game itself. Since the target phrase "dropping Rodgers" suggests Rodgers is not performing well, and the comment appears to be referencing a decision in a fantasy context where he might be seen as an out-group entity affecting the commenter negatively, "Rodgers" is tagged as [OUT] instead of [IN]. It's a rare instance where the context of a different competition (fantasy football) slightly alters the tagging of the entity.	The comment mentions "dropping Rodgers," which implies that the commenter is talking about the out-group player Aaron Rodgers, since Rodgers plays for the Packers and the commenter supports the Chiefs. The use of "I should have consulted with Dr. Joe Rogan" is an indirect reference to something about Rodgers and doesn't change his team affiliation. Therefore, "Rodgers" should be tagged [OUT].	1636326375.0	packers	chiefs	Hunterrose242	:GB:	2.0	0.03086014837026596	[5]

In this case, "Parker" is in reference to DeVante Parker, a wide receiver for the Dolphins. The win probability is relatively high at 63.6%, suggesting that the Dolphins are performing well at the time of the comment. The commenter appears to be celebrating or acknowledging Parker's exemplary performance. Therefore, "Parker" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	The comment is expressing praise for 'Parker', who is a player for the Dolphins. Since the Dolphins are the in-group team that the commenter supports, 'Parker' should be tagged as [IN]. The absence of any other entities in the comment means that only 'Parker' is tagged and the rest of the phrase provides context to the praise. Therefore, 'Parker' is the correct referring expression to tag as [IN].	1631488304.0	dolphins	patriots	axelfreed		8.0	0.635801434516907	[5]

Therefore, "We" is tagged as [IN], reflecting the in-group team, the Bengals.	'We' in this context refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.

The comment expresses surprise at Tucker missing a kick, which is in favor of the Patriots. Given the extremely low win probability for the Patriots, any mistake by the out-group is noteworthy to the commenter. Therefore, 'TUCKER' should be tagged as [OUT] since he is a player for the opposing team.	The comment is expressing surprise that Tucker has missed a kick.

[SENT] Just stfu 	['Kirk']	[(7, 11)]	['[IN]']	The comment mentions "Kirk," who is almost certainly Kirk Cousins, the quarterback for the Vikings. The commenter is likely a Vikings fan given the in-group team is the Vikings, evidenced by the win probability being almost even, reflecting a closely contested game. The phrase "gets crushed all the time making throws" suggests a tone of frustration or defensiveness about how often Kirk Cousins is under pressure. Fans often defend their players when they believe they are being unfairly criticized or put in difficult situations. Therefore, "Kirk" should be tagged [IN] since he refers to the in-group team, the Vikings. The second sentence "Just stfu" expresses frustration but doesn't introduce a new referent, and thus does not contain a specific in-group, out-group, or other reference.	The commenter refers to 'Kirk', which is short for Kirk Cousins, the quarterback for the Vikings. Since the commenter is a Vikings supporter, it is logical to tag 'Kirk' as [IN] because the phrase indicates concern for the in-group player getting crushed. The second sentence, "Just stfu," does not explicitly reference any specific entity and can be interpreted as a general expression of frustration, not necessarily tied to a specific entity, hence it remains untagged.	1632090539.0	vikings	cardinals	openlyincognito	beast hunter	1.0	0.49357160925865196	[5]

The win probability for the Lions is relatively low, suggesting that the Lions are not performing well, which further implies that impressive plays are more likely to be made by the out-group (Eagles) in this context. 'he' most likely refers to a player from the out-group who made the surprising catch. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged [OUT].	The comment expresses surprise or admiration for a catch made by "he." Given that the commenter supports the Lions (the in-group) and is facing the Eagles (the out-group), the comment is likely referring to a notable play made by an opposing player.

They are criticizing his performance but also making excuses for him, implying they are supporters of the team. The name 'Dalton' should be tagged as [IN] because he is a player for the Saints. The phrase 'a saint' refers to Dalton's team affiliation, so it should also be tagged [IN]. Finally, 'he' in the second part of the sentence refers back to Dalton, who is an in-group player, so it should be tagged as [IN] as well. The low win probability (4.0%) indicates that the team is not performing well overall, which aligns with the critical tone of the comment.	The commenter is discussing Andy Dalton, who is a member of the Saints, the in-group team. Since the comment is directed towards a specific player's performance and their experience in a game context, all referring expressions are related to Dalton and his association with the Saints.

The phrase "gg boys" is a common way of ending the game with a sense of sportsmanship, often acknowledging that the game is effectively over in favor of the opponent. Since the commenter is likely addressing their own team's players (the "boys"), this implies a reference to the in-group. Consequently, the whole sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as it implicitly refers to the Dolphins.	The comment "gg boys" generally indicates that the commenter is expressing sportsmanship or concluding remarks about the game.

The sentence does not contain explicit identifiers referring to the in-group, out-group, or other teams, so the entire sentence should be tagged as implicitly referring to the in-group.

The first sentence ('Being competitive would be nice') is implicitly referring to the in-group, as the commenter is likely lamenting their own team's lack of competitiveness. This indicates that the sentiment is about the in-group's performance without explicitly mentioning them, and thus the sentence should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence explicitly refers to the out-group team, the Lions, who are dominating.

There is no direct naming of either the in-group or the out-group team, but context and phrasing provide clues for tagging.In the first sentence, "Didn't like the look they had for whatever Play they had called so they kicked the FG", the term "they" is used twice. The commenter does not specify which team "they" refers to, but considering the win probability is relatively high for the Patriots (in-group), it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is talking about a decision made by the Patriots. Fans discussing their own team's tactics, especially in terms of approval or disapproval ("didn't like the look"), often refers to their own team as "they" when not explicitly naming them. Therefore, both instances of "they" should be tagged [IN] (referring to the Patriots).In the second sentence, "I actually don't mind it in this game where winner will probably have 9 points", there is no explicit team mentioned. The phrase here is clearly a continuation from the first sentence where the commenter had already been focusing on in-group decisions.

Since there are no explicit mentions of either team and the commenter does not appear to be criticizing the decision harshly, they are likely talking about the in-group team, the Patriots. Fans often discuss strategic decisions and their feelings about them when referring to their own team. The words 'they' in the sentences likely refer to the Patriots, as the overall tone and context indicate a critical but understanding view, more common when a fan evaluates their own team. Since the comment does not contain any explicit words or phrases that refer to the opponent team or another team, the only entities mentioned implicitly are part of the in-group team.The commenter is likely referring to the in-group team, the Patriots, discussing a strategic decision (kicking a field goal). The words 'they' are tagged as [IN], as the tone suggests a fan's perspective evaluating their own team's decision-making. Fans typically discuss such tactical choices and their acceptance of the strategy more when referring to their own team.

Jake Elliot is a placekicker for the Philadelphia Eagles, the in-group team. The commenter is likely praising an in-group player for their performance.

The phrase "We suck again!" indicates frustration and disappointment from the commenter towards their own team. "We" is commonly used by commenters to refer to their own team, indicating a sense of affiliation and support. Given this context, it is reasonable to tag "We" as [IN] because it directly refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. The phrase "Oh no!" does not directly refer to any team but sets up the emotional context for the subsequent sentence. Hence, the sentence "[SENT] Oh no !" is left untagged, and the following sentence "[SENT] [IN] suck again !" has "We" tagged as [IN].	The phrase "Oh no!" expresses a negative reaction to something that is likely going wrong for the team the commenter supports. The expression "We suck again!" indicates dissatisfaction with a recurring poor performance, where 'we' strongly suggests the commenter is talking about their own team. Fans typically use 'we' to refer to their in-group team, implying a personal connection and loyalty.Thus, 'We' in the second sentence should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group, the Eagles, disrupting the reference tag.

Oweh is a player for the Ravens, the in-group team, thus 'Oweh' should be tagged [IN]. Judon is a former Ravens player who now plays for the New England Patriots, which makes 'Judon' an entity that is neither part of the in-group nor out-group. Hence, 'Judon' should be tagged [OTHER]. The win probability for the Ravens is high, indicating they are probably doing well, which might be why the commenter is making a comparison between a current and former player with respect to a good performance. Therefore, the correct tagged output is '[IN] did his best [OTHER] impression there' with the referring expressions 'Oweh' and 'Judon'.	Oweh is a player for the Ravens, the in-group team, and is thus tagged as [IN]. Judon, although formerly a player for the Ravens, currently plays for the Patriots, which is another team in the NFL and not the opponent Bengals. Therefore, Judon is tagged as [OTHER]. The sentence structure and critique imply familiarity and evaluation of a past player's style against a current in-group player, reinforcing these tag assignments.	1635095226.0	ravens	bengals	cshark2222	Ravens	4.0	0.746303379535675	[5, 5]

The high win probability indicates that the Browns are likely doing well in the game, which corroborates the celebratory nature of the comment. Using "CHIEF" here does not refer to the Chiefs team but rather is part of an exuberant exclamation related to the in-group team's success. Therefore, "CHIEF" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group.	The comment uses the word 'CHIEF' in an exclamatory manner, which can be interpreted as a cheer or expression of excitement. Given that the commenter supports the Browns, it indicates a positive reaction towards their own team rather than the opponent.

Enagbare is a player for the Packers, making him part of the in-group. The high win probability suggests that the Packers are performing well, which could be why the commenter is focusing on a specific player's near-successful play. 'enagbare' should be tagged [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team. Therefore, "Dang enagbare almost had a pick6" implies admiration for the in-group player's efforts, aligning with the in-group support context.	The word "enagbare" refers to Kingsley Enagbare, a player for the Packers. Since the commenter supports the Packers, any reference to Enagbare should be tagged as [IN] because he is a member of the in-group team. Therefore, 'enagbare' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group, making the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS correctly tagged.	1671500429.0	packers	rams	scalarray	:GB:	9.0	0.854689970612526	[5]

['they', 'Clowney', 'their guys']	[(17, 21), (60, 67), (100, 110)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]', '[OUT]']	The commenter refers to 'they' in the context of booing, which is indicative of the out-group fans booing an action by the in-group player Clowney. Clowney, mentioned by name, is a well-known Browns player, which is why he is tagged [IN]. 'Their guys' implies players from the out-group team that Clowney was interacting with aggressively, hence this phrase should be tagged [OUT]. The win probability is somewhat balanced, which suggests that both teams have been competitive, making it reasonable for fans to react strongly to individual plays. Therefore, 'they' and 'their guys' should be tagged [OUT], and 'Clowney' should be tagged [IN].	The comment mentions a negative reaction ('booing') from the crowd, which is likely from the out-group fans. The noun phrase 'their guys' implies players from the out-group team (Vikings). Clowney, a player from the in-group (Browns), is being described as becoming 'aggro,' indicative of his aggressive actions disrupting the out-group. Thus, 'they' should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to the out-group crowd, 'Clowney' should be tagged as [IN] as he is a player for the Browns, and 'their guys' should be tagged as [OUT] as it refers to the players from the opponent team, the Vikings.	1633282609.0	browns	vikings	PPQue6	:rally-opposum:	2.0	0.449499249458313	[5, 5, 5]

The low win probability indicates the Bills are struggling, adding to the frustration expressed. "Mahomes" is specifically tagged as [OUT] because he is a player for the opponent team. The phrase "they can't ever grab" implicitly refers to the in-group's defense, which aligns with the frustration being directed at their inability to tackle the out-group's player. Thus, "Mahomes" should be tagged [OUT].	The commenter is frustrated that their team's defense cannot successfully tackle Mahomes. Since Mahomes is the quarterback for the out-group team, the Chiefs, 'Mahomes' should be tagged as [OUT]. The use of 'they' refers to the in-group Bills' defense, which is implied but not explicitly stated in the comment. Therefore, 'Mahomes' is the only explicit referring expression needing to be tagged with [OUT].	1642988958.0	bills	chiefs	sigil016		0.0	0.28390324115753196	[5]

The use of '49ers' without additional qualifications in a casual and somewhat frustrated context commonly indicates the in-group, especially considering the win probability is relatively neutral, implying the game is still competitive, and fans might be anxious about moments that could affect the outcome. Despite the relatively neutral win probability, the commenter is expressing a concern about a specific situation for their team, which fans typically do about their team rather than an opponent or another team. Therefore, '49ers' should be tagged [IN] since it directly references the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter expresses frustration or disappointment about a scenario where the 49ers, the team they support, fail to score. This kind of comment typically arises from an in-group perspective because the commenter is emotionally invested in the performance of their team. The phrase "sooooooooooooo 49ers" implies a certain expected behavior or pattern associated with the 49ers, which fans of the in-group would commonly use to vent their frustration. Therefore, '49ers' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1666561292.0	49ers	chiefs	gbassman5	:jerseyaway20: Garrison Hearst	7.0	0.55001175403595	[5]

['Seattle', 'we', 'we']	[(26, 33), (77, 79), (108, 110)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment refers to both the out-group and the in-group teams, despite the high win probability for the in-group.   The phrase "Seattle had one good drive" clearly refers to the Seahawks, which is the opponent team (out-group), so it should be tagged as [OUT].- The phrase "we aren't going to win unless we score a Ty in every drive" expresses concern about the in-group's performance, despite the high win probability. Commenters often use "we" to refer to the team they support, which in this case is the 49ers (in-group). Thus, "we" in both instances should be tagged as [IN].This explanation justifies why the terms should be tagged appropriately:  "Seattle" as [OUT]- "we" (in both instances) as [IN]	The commenter mentions "Seattle," which is the name of the out-group team, the Seahawks, and should be tagged [OUT]. The use of "we" in this context refers to the in-group, the 49Ers, expressing the commenter's concern about their performance. Therefore, "we" should be tagged with [IN] in both instances. The phrases "Seriously" and "aren't going to win unless we score a Ty in every drive" implicitly critique the in-group's performance, aligning with a fan's perspective on their own team.	1673735447.0	49ers	seahawks	ninjay209		1.0	0.876309886574745	[5, 5, 5]

[SENT] [IN] should try it for the first 3 quarters too next game ! 😋 	['We']	[(26, 28)]	['[IN]']	The use of 'We' typically denotes the in-group, suggesting that the commenter is a supporter of the team and is making a suggestion about the strategy their team should employ in future games. This aligns with the context of the Panthers (in-group) having a low win probability at the time of the comment, which indicates they might have been struggling. The suggestion to change the strategy implicitly refers to the in-group team, trying to improve their performance in future games. Therefore, '[SENT]' in the second sentence should be tagged [IN], and 'We' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	The comment is indicative of a suggestion or strategy for improvement, which is typically directed towards the team the commenter supports. The word 'We' refers to the in-group team, the Panthers. Fans often use 'we' to refer to their own team when discussing what 'we should do' next, showing a sense of inclusiveness and vested interest. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group.

The commenter expresses a desire to bring back Bruce Arians, who was previously a coach in the Buccaneers organization. Despite the high win probability, the comment indicates some dissatisfaction with the current state of the team, which is a sentiment directed at their own team. Hence, "We" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group.	The word "We" typically refers to the in-group, particularly when lamenting a situation or making a suggestion for improvement, which indicates the commenter's support for the Buccaneers. Therefore, "We" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. The sentence as a whole is implicitly about the Buccaneers as well, hence the tag [IN] covering the entire sentence.	1672021780.0	buccaneers	cardinals	Ok-War1755		2.0	0.81918728351593	[5]

The win probability is very high, indicating that the in-group is performing well overall, which might justify the somewhat playful tone of the comment. Thus, 'Devin' and 'White' should be tagged with [IN], since they refer to a player from the team that the commenter supports. The first sentence does not have a specific entity reference, so it isn't tagged separately. The comment reflects a lighthearted remark on an action performed by an in-group player, hence the correct tagging of those references.	The commenter seems to be a supporter of the Buccaneers, as indicated by the in-group. Devin White is a well-known player for the Buccaneers. When the commenter mentions 'Devin' and 'White,' they are referring to an in-group player. The phrase 'Lol' is a casual acknowledgment of an amusing moment, and '[IN]' correctly tags the sentence as it relates implicitly to the in-group player's actions. Thus, 'Devin' and 'White' should both be tagged as [IN], and both sentences should also be tagged [IN] due to their focus on an in-group player's actions.	1639348009.0	buccaneers	bills	Piano_Fingerbanger	:buccobruceorange: 	12.0	0.908888086676598	[5, 5]

The absence of other qualifying nouns to specify an out-group player leads to the conclusion that 'he' refers to a player from the in-group team. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to an in-group wide receiver not performing up to the commenter's expectations.	The commenter is discussing an issue with dropped passes, which is likely directed at the in-group team since it's a common criticism. The phrase "he's not your prototypical wr" indicates a specific wide receiver they are disappointed with, which again points to their own team's player. Since the comment is directed at a specific player's performance and the in-group team is the 49ers, "he" should be tagged with [IN], indicating that they are talking about a player on the 49ers' team.	1642376547.0	49ers	cowboys	LHRXPONCHITO69	:jimmyg: Jimmy Garoppolo	2.0	0.9049882714882405	[5]

[SENT] [IN] still plays with the ball , and the punt gets blocked 	['Bailey']	[(91, 97)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is likely describing a play where the Patriots (in-group) had their punt blocked. Bailey is a known player for the Patriots, so mentioning "Bailey" implicitly refers to the in-group team. The win probability is relatively low, indicating the Patriots are probably losing, which might explain the critical tone in the comment. 'Bailey' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group. The rest of the sentences describe the play without direct reference to specific teams, so no other explicit tags are needed.	The commenter is frustrated with a specific play, particularly criticizing Bailey's action which leads to a blocked punt. Bailey is a player for the Patriots, the in-group team. Therefore, 'Bailey' should be tagged with [IN] since this refers to a member of the commenter's supported team. The other sentences do not refer explicitly to any specific team or player and thus are not tagged.	1639878511.0	patriots	colts	Barakat_Firdos		1.0	0.22068814353995803	[5]

The use of "Lol wow" followed by a name typically indicates a sarcastic or exasperated tone, which fans often use when discussing their own team's players who are underperforming. "Another shit throw" and "gets his receiver killed" further emphasize criticism directed towards the in-group player's performance. Therefore, "Ben" and "he" should be tagged [IN] since they refer to the in-group player, and "his receiver" should also be tagged [IN] as it refers to a Steelers receiver. The win probability is low, fitting the context of frustration with the in-group's performance.	The comment is criticizing Ben Roethlisberger, a player for the Steelers, indicating it is from the perspective of a fan who is unhappy with their own team's performance. 'Ben' should be tagged [IN] as he is a player for the Steelers, and 'he' in the second sentence refers to Ben Roethlisberger and should also be tagged with [IN].

Given that the in-group team is the Titans, it is reasonable to assume that the commenter is highlighting a player from the in-group, expressing strong support or admiration. This is further supported by the relatively low win probability, a time when fans may emphasize the positive aspects of individual players from their team. Thus, 'LANDRY' in all of its mentions should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter is expressing their admiration for a particular player, repeating his name 'LANDRY' multiple times in their top five ranking. In the context of the comment, the repeated emphasis on this player implies strong support. Given that the in-group team is the Titans, Jarvis Landry must be a player for the Titans.

Therefore, 'Albert Wilson' is tagged as [IN] because he is a player on the Dolphins, the team the commenter supports.	The commenter is expressing their dissatisfaction with Albert Wilson, a player for the Dolphins, which is the in-group team. By mentioning 'Cut Albert Wilson', they are talking about a player they support but are unhappy with, indicating their connection to the in-group.

The in-group team is the Patriots, evidenced here by the mention of Mac Jones, a player on the Patriots. The phrase 'that Bucs D' refers to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' defense, which is not the opponent team (the Saints) nor the in-group team, thus it should be tagged [OTHER]. The pronoun 'he', in this context, refers back to 'Mac Jones', so it should also be tagged [IN]. While the Saints are the out-group team, the comment is focused on an upcoming matchup against the Buccaneers, hence the Bucs D (defense) is tagged as other since they are some other team in the NFL. So the tags correctly identify 'Mac Jones' and 'he' as [IN] (since they refer to an in-group player) and 'that Bucs D' as [OTHER].	Mac Jones is the quarterback for the New England Patriots, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Mac Jones' should be tagged as [IN]. 'that Bucs D' refers to the defense of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which is another team in the NFL but not the opponent in this case. Hence, 'that Bucs D' should be tagged as [OTHER]. Lastly, 'he' refers back to Mac Jones, so it should also be tagged as [IN].	1632681686.0	patriots	saints	ltsDat1Guy		4.0	0.238945364952087	[5, 5, 5]

Given the high win probability of 81.1% for the in-group (Bills), it implies that the Jaguars are losing significantly or are in a difficult spot in the game. The phrase "wish the game could just end right now" suggests that the Jaguars are having a tough time and would prefer the game to end to avoid further suffering. This sentiment aligns with how fans might perceive the losing team in unfavorable conditions. Therefore, "the Jags" should be tagged as [OUT] because it explicitly refers to the opposing team, the Jaguars. The rest of the sentence expresses this difficult situation without requiring additional tags.	The comment is about the Jaguars (referred to as 'the Jags') wishing the game could end, implying they are in a losing or difficult position. This indicates criticism or commentary from the perspective of an opposing fan. Since the Bills are the in-group and the Jaguars are the out-group, 'the Jags' should be tagged [OUT].

In the first sentence, the comment is praising the impact of a competent and mature coach on their team. Since the comment is positive and in the context of a victory or significant lead, the competent and mature coach is likely referring to someone on the in-group (Jaguars) team. Hence, 'a competent , mature coach' should be tagged as [IN]. 'This team' also refers to the Jaguars, so it should be tagged as [IN].In the second sentence, 'Trevor' and 'Kirk' are references to Jaguars' players Trevor Lawrence (quarterback) and Christian Kirk (wide receiver).

Therefore, "Trevor" and "Kirk" should also be tagged as [IN], as they refer to in-group players.	1663530146.0	jaguars	colts	celestial-oceanic	:CJ1::CJ2::CJ3:	1.0	0.999980807304382	[5, 5, 5, 5]

"refs" are a neutral party who officiate the game, and the term "the cowboys" refers to the Dallas Cowboys, a team that is not participating in the current game. Given that the win probability for the Chargers is extremely high (99.9%), the commenter might be reflecting on past games, particularly one involving the Cowboys. Therefore, "refs" should be tagged as [OTHER] because they are not directly associated with either the in-group or out-group, and "the cowboys" should also be tagged as [OTHER] because they refer to a different team in the NFL.	The game is between the Chargers and Giants, making any reference to the "cowboys game" about another contest that does not involve the in-group or out-group teams. The term "refs" and "the cowboys" thus refer to entities that are part of some other game involving other teams, and should be tagged [OTHER].	1639351266.0	chargers	giants	Med609	AIR BEAR ⚡️	2.0	0.999121921602637	[5, 5]

[SENT] Fuck this conservative play calling when [IN] have a chance to go for the win 	['Shanahan', 'you']	[(27, 35), (98, 101)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is frustrated with the performance of their own team, the 49ers, as indicated by the sentence, "Shanahan needs to go." Shanahan is the head coach of the 49ers, and criticizing the coach is something a fan would typically do for their own team. Therefore, "Shanahan" should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "when you have a chance to go for the win" implies the commenter is upset with the 49ers not taking aggressive chances when they have the opportunity. The word "you" in this context is a conversational way of addressing the team or its management, signifying frustration from a fan's perspective. Thus, "you" should be tagged [IN] as well. The sentences without explicit reference names but implying the in-group (49ers) should also be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is frustrated and discussing what needs to change if 'they' lose. 'Shanahan' refers to the head coach of the 49ers, thus tagging 'Shanahan' as [IN] is appropriate since he is part of the in-group team. The second sentence continues to express frustration with the in-group's play-calling, indicated by 'you' which refers to the in-group (the 49ers) in a direct address. Therefore, 'you' should be tagged with [IN]. The commenter would not be this invested in criticizing the out-group, thus both references are correctly tagged as [IN].	1643595730.0	49ers	rams	RefreshReset74		-4.0	0.412883877754211	[5, 5]

The win probability for the in-group team (Colts) is relatively high, indicating that they are doing well, so it is unlikely the commenter is criticizing their own team's kicker in this context. Rather, they are skeptical about the performance of the opponent's kicker, which aligns with fans often focusing on key moments or players from the opposing team when the game is near its end or a critical play. Therefore, 'this kicker' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to an opponent team's player.	The comment likely refers to the out-group since it expresses doubt about the kicker's ability to succeed ('no way this kicker hits it'). Given that the out-group is the Chiefs, 'this kicker' should be tagged [OUT], as the commenter is doubting the performance of the out-group's kicker.	1664136187.0	colts	chiefs	ignatiusjreillyreak		1.0	0.865594103932381	[5]

Crosby is a player for the Green Bay Packers, which is a different team within the NFL but not the opponent of the Cardinals in this game. Hence, Crosby should be tagged as [OTHER]. The win probability is relatively high for the in-group, indicating the Cardinals are likely doing well, but the specific mention of "Crosby" making a field goal has no direct connection to the current teams playing. Therefore, "Crosby" should be tagged as [OTHER].	The game is between the Cardinals and the 49ers. Mason Crosby is a kicker for the Green Bay Packers, which is a team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group in this context. Therefore, 'Crosby' should be tagged as [OTHER] since he refers to a member of an NFL team that is not involved in the game being discussed.	1633897610.0	cardinals	49ers	nyyth242	:cardinals: Cardinals	1.0	0.732450425624847	[5]

[SENT] Idc 	['Boyer', 'This defense']	[(30, 35), (45, 57)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The win probability for the Dolphins is 0.0%, indicating a clear and decisive loss or impending loss, which can lead to emotional and critical comments from fans. The comment suggests firing a personnel member named Boyer. Since Boyer is mentioned without further identification, it is reasonable to infer that Boyer is a known member affiliated with the in-group team (Dolphins). Fans usually discuss firing or praising team personnel that belong to the team they support, not the opponent, when making such suggestions. Thus, 'Boyer' should be tagged [IN].The second sentence expresses frustration with the defense by saying 'This defense is dogshit.' The use of "This defense" without a qualifier typically refers to the in-group's defense, particularly in the context of a disappointed comment following a poor performance (as indicated by the win probability). Therefore, 'This defense' should also be tagged [IN].  'SENT' tokens without further entity references, like 'Idc,' are tagged appropriately as they provide sentiment but not specific entity references. Thus, the tagged output and referring expressions are correct based on the context and typical fan behavior in such situations.	The commenter is frustrated and calls for the firing of Boyer, indicating a level of investment and familiarity that a fan typically has with their in-group team. Thus, 'Boyer' should be tagged as [IN] since he is likely a member of the coaching staff for the Dolphins. 'This defense' is referred to negatively, which aligns with a fan criticizing their own team, so it should also be tagged as [IN]. Therefore, both referring expressions align with the in-group team (Dolphins) that the commenter supports.	1665345568.0	dolphins	jets	paradigm_x2		4.0	0.0002770368591880068	[5, 5]

The comment places blame on 'The offense' and 'McDaniels'. Since the in-group team is the Raiders, it is natural for the commenter to be referring to their own team's performance and personnel. 'The offense' refers to the Raiders' offensive unit, and 'McDaniels' is likely referencing Josh McDaniels, the head coach of the Raiders. Fans typically critique their own team and coaching staff in such scenarios, hence both 'The offense' and 'McDaniels' should be tagged [IN] as they are entities associated with the in-group team.	The commenter is a supporter of the Raiders and is lamenting that their own team's offense and coach McDaniels are responsible for throwing the game. 'The offense' and 'McDaniels' are terms that directly refer to the in-group entities within the context of the comment. Therefore, both 'The offense' and 'McDaniels' should be tagged as [IN].	1663545554.0	raiders	cardinals	mondeezy_95	:Logo_95-Present:	2.0	0.0	[5, 5]

['him', 'Sweat']	[(27, 30), (47, 52)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The low win probability suggests that the in-group (Eagles) is losing, which could explain why the commenter is expressing negative opinions. The phrase "I 'll still hate on him" is most likely directed at a player from the in-group, as fans often criticize their own team's players when they are performing poorly. Similarly, "It was Sweat that caused it" implies a specific player from the Eagles (Josh Sweat) caused a particular event that the commenter believes was negative. Therefore, both 'him' and 'Sweat' should be tagged [IN], as they are referring to players of the in-group team.	The first sentence indicates the commenter's negative feelings towards a specific player. Since no specific player from the out-group is directly mentioned and it's more likely that a fan expresses this kind of sentiment about their own team's player, 'him' should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, 'Sweat' refers to Josh Sweat, a player for the Philadelphia Eagles, who, in this context, is the in-group. Therefore, 'Sweat' should be tagged as [IN], as should the word 'him' which refers to Sweat in the previous sentence.	1633287106.0	eagles	chiefs	South-Hippo-7062		1.0	0.0790739059448242	[5, 5]

['the oline', 'We']	[(23, 32), (82, 84)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is expressing frustration over a loss, evidenced by the extremely low win probability of 0.1%, which indicates that the in-group team (Saints) is almost certainly losing. In the first sentence, 'the oline' refers to the offensive line, which is being blamed for poor play. Given the context, it's reasonable to assume that the commenter is talking about the in-group's offensive line since fans usually critique their own team's performance directly. Hence, 'the oline' is tagged with [IN].In the second sentence, 'We' clearly refers to the in-group team, as fans usually use 'we' to refer to the team they support. The sentence continues to criticize the team's conservative play, reinforcing that it is directed towards the in-group (Saints). Therefore, 'We' is also tagged with [IN]. Thus, the correct tagged comment indicates that both references are to the in-group team, the Saints, aligning with the frustrated tone of a likely Saints fan.	The commenter is placing the blame for the loss on elements of their own team, specifically the offensive line's poor play and the conservative playcalling. Fans typically criticize their own team's performance, and the use of "we" indicates they are referring to their own team. Therefore, 'the oline' should be tagged [IN], as it refers to the in-group team's offensive line, and 'We' should also be tagged [IN], as it refers to the in-group team in general.	1632081628.0	saints	panthers	ReineLeNoire		14.0	0.0006981335463930316	[5, 5]

The win probability is low, suggesting	The commenter is talking positively about 'they', implying that this refers to an in-group unit. The units of a team's play (such as defensive lines, offensive lines, etc.) are usually praised and criticized within the context of the in-group team. Since this is complimentary, 'they' should be tagged with [IN]. The 'Texans' game refers to a game against a team that is neither the Jets nor the Saints, thus 'Texans' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The repetition of 'they' in the second and third sentences continues to refer to the same in-group unit, thus they should also be tagged with [IN]. Therefore each instance of 'They' and 'they' is tagged with [IN] since the commenter is referring to an in-group unit that performed well in both games and is defending their performance in the context where they can only do so much.	1639336274.0	jets	saints	legend023	:OtherEternalOptimist:	1.0	0.177212953567505	[5, 5, 5, 5]

"Chuck" is praised without any negative language, implying that he's a member of the in-group, i.e., the Ravens. Additionally, "nice play from d" is describing a positive performance from the defense, which implies it is the in-group defense that the commenter supports. The win probability of 61.0% further indicates that the in-group is doing relatively well, which aligns with the positive tone of the comment.Thus, "chuck" and "d" are tagged as [IN] because they refer to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The comment is praising Chuck and the current defensive play, which indicates positive sentiment towards the in-group team, the Ravens. 'Chuck' is likely a nickname for a Ravens player, thus it should be tagged with [IN]. Additionally, 'd' refers to the team's defense and should be tagged with [IN], as the commenter is a Ravens supporter celebrating their defensive performance. Therefore, both 'chuck' and 'd' should be tagged as in-group references.	1634490610.0	ravens	chargers			1.0	0.609868973493576	[5, 5]

The first sentence is neutral and speaks about a personal action. The second sentence, referring to a positive event (a 75-yard touchdown), is implicitly celebrating the in-group team's success, which should be tagged with [IN] since the commenter is celebrating an in-group success implicitly. The final sentence directly addresses "KC," which stands for Kansas City (Chiefs) and thanks them humorously, indicating a positive sentiment towards the in-group team. Thus, "KC" should be tagged [IN], and the second sentence's in-group context properly justifies tagging the sentence itself with [IN].	The commenter's overall tone and expression indicate that they support the Chiefs. In the first sentence, the commenter talks about their jersey, which doesn't directly mention any team. In the second sentence, the commenter describes a play resulting in a touchdown, which implies their satisfaction and is likely about their in-group, the Chiefs, disrupting the game in the comment. Hence, the sentence should be tagged [IN]. Finally, in the third sentence, the commenter expresses enthusiasm and claims credit for the Chiefs' success, as indicated by 'YOU'RE WELCOME KC!'. 'KC' refers to Kansas City, home of the Chiefs, so it should be tagged [IN].So, the second sentence is related to the in-group though it doesn't have an explicit referring expression, hence it should be tagged [IN] with '[SENT]' being the referring expression. In the third sentence, 'KC' is an explicit reference to the in-group and should be tagged [IN].	1631488108.0	chiefs	browns	Bill_Brocius		2.0	0.776137959383428	[5, 5]

The phrase "I think it stands" typically refers to a call regarding possession or a play that might be challenged. The commenter appears to be discussing a specific play involving their team that they believe will not be overturned. Thus, the entire sentence is implicitly about the Broncos, making '[SENT]' tagged with '[IN]' appropriate as there are no explicit words or phrases that directly reference the in-group or out-group but the context is focused on the in-group.	The comment is discussing a play that was very close to being a fumble, and the phrase "I think it stands" suggests the commenter hopes or believes it will benefit their team, which indicates a supportive stance. This implies the play in question involves the in-group. Since there's no explicit reference to the Broncos, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group.

['brady', 'the falcons', 'we']	[(26, 31), (65, 76), (109, 111)]	['[OTHER]', '[OUT]', '[IN]']	The commenter references three different groups in their comment. The first sentence mentions 'brady', referring to Tom Brady, who is not related to either the in-group (Bears) or the out-group (Falcons) but belongs to another team, likely making him an [OTHER]. The second sentence references 'the falcons', the opponent team, and thus is tagged as [OUT]. The third sentence uses 'we', which almost always refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports, in this case the Bears, making it [IN]. There are no explicit mentions of any team in the final sentence, but the sentiment of disappointment logically follows from the previous sentence, supporting the idea that it is also implicitly about the in-group, but without new tags needed. Hence, the tags 'brady', 'the falcons', and 'we' are correctly identified as [OTHER], [OUT], and [IN], respectively.	The commenter mentions three entities in their comment. Brady refers to Tom Brady, a player for neither the Bears (in-group) nor the Falcons (out-group) which means 'brady' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The second sentence mentions the Falcons, who are the opponent team in this context, thus 'the falcons' should be tagged as [OUT]. Finally, the commenter uses 'we' in the third sentence to describe their own team's performance, indicating that 'we' refers to the in-group (Bears), so it should be tagged as [IN]. The '[SENT]' tokens for the third and fourth sentences are tagged as [IN] and [NONE] respectively since these sentences are about the in-group and do not explicitly mention any entity.	1668977942.0	bears	falcons			1.0	0.00966674089431796	[5, 5, 5]

This is indicative of a supporter addressing their own team, hence the comment is implicitly about the in-group. The lack of specific mentions within the comment means that it is a general statement aimed at the in-group team's performance. Despite the win probability being relatively balanced, the frustration suggests the commenter expects better from their own team. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' since the comment as a whole is implicitly referring to the in-group team, the Chiefs.	The comment is an expression of frustration directed at a team, likely the in-group, as fans typically don't admonish the opponent or out-group to "get it together." There is no explicit reference to a team or player, but the overall sentiment suggests criticism towards the team the commenter supports.

Given that 'the defense' is mentioned without specifying any team, it is reasonable to assume that the commenter is talking about their own team's defense. Thus, 'the defense' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	The commenter is expressing a glimmer of hope for their team's defense, which likely indicates disappointment or concern for their own team's performance. Since the comment refers to the defense in a positive light ("hope for the defense"), it suggests optimism for the in-group team that the commenter supports.

The comment criticizes the out-group's players for taunting Kyler Murray despite him not being the one who fumbled. This criticism suggests that the commenter is sympathetic towards Murray, aligning with the in-group. Therefore, 'Murray' and 'he' should both be tagged as [IN], as they are referring to an in-group player. This explanation aligns with the high win probability for the in-group, suggesting the in-group is doing well overall, which supports the focus on specific incidents like the taunting described.	The comment references 'Murray', who is a player on the Cardinals, the in-group team. The criticism ('what morons') is directed at the opposing team's players for taunting the wrong player. Therefore, 'Murray' should be tagged [IN] because he is part of the in-group team, and 'he' should also be tagged [IN] as it refers back to Murray. This makes 'Murray' and 'he' both tags for the in-group, while the word 'morons' refers to the out-group by implication, though it isn't explicitly mentioned in the tagged output.	1633907236.0	cardinals	49ers	I_shall_not_pass	:Primary1: Kyler Murray	3.0	0.75559189915657	[5, 5]

['the offense', 'these POS refs']	[(23, 34), (71, 85)]	['[IN]', '[OTHER]']	The comment expresses frustration about the in-group's offense struggling, which tells us the commenter supports the Packers ('the offense' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team). Additionally, the commenter attributes the difficulty to the referees, describing them derogatorily as "POS refs". Referring to referees generally applies across the NFL and not specifically to one team; hence, "these POS refs" should be tagged [OTHER]. The high win probability for the in-group suggests the team is generally doing well, but this specific frustration is likely focused on a particular play or series where perceived unfair officiating has hindered their performance.	The commenter is frustrated with the game's officiating and the impact it has on their team's performance. 'the offense' refers to the in-group team, the Packers, as the commenter is discussing their ability to advance the ball against the opposing team's defense. The negative term 'these POS refs' is used to complain about the referees; they are not affiliated with the playing teams but are part of the game's overall structure, thus they should be tagged as [OTHER]. Therefore, 'the offense' is correctly tagged [IN] as it refers to the Packers, and 'these POS refs' is accurately tagged [OTHER].	1666551014.0	packers	washington	Farmkev		3.0	0.718735694885254	[5, 5]

The 'we' in this context implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Seahawks, hinting at their defensive efforts against Purdy. Given the relatively low win probability for the Seahawks, the comment suggests concern over whether their defense will allow Purdy to have an outstanding game. Therefore, 'Purdy' should be tagged [OUT] as he belongs to the opponent team, the 49ers. The rest of the sentence, while making implicit references, does not directly name any specific entities that need tagging.	The commenter refers to 'Purdy', who is a player for the 49Ers, the out-group team in this context. The use of 'we' suggests the commenter is a Seahawks fan and is wondering if their team (the in-group) will make the out-group player (Purdy) appear legendary ('look like the GOAT'). Therefore, 'Purdy' should be tagged as [OUT] since this refers to a member of the out-group team the commenter is talking about. There are no explicit tags for the in-group since the reference is indirect and implicit within the phrase.	1671153685.0	seahawks	49ers	thingmaker123		1.0	0.323515295982361	[5]

The commenter is likely making a sarcastic or critical comment about Andy Dalton, which implies that 'Andy Dalton™' should be tagged [OUT] as he is part of the out-group team. The high win probability suggests that the in-group (Cardinals) is doing well, potentially leading to this mockery of an opponent's player. Thus, 'Andy Dalton™' should be tagged with [OUT].	'Andy Dalton™' is a reference to Andy Dalton, a quarterback for the New Orleans Saints, who are the out-group team. The commenter is making a remark about a moment involving Andy Dalton, so 'Andy Dalton™' should be tagged with [OUT]. The phrase 'Certified Andy Dalton™ Moment' does not refer to the in-group (Cardinals) at all.	1666316000.0	cardinals	saints	Anthrolologist	:larry_david: Larry David	3.0	0.757546504210176	[5]

This suggests that Poyer is a player the commenter supports, and since the in-group team is the Bills, Poyer must be a member of the Bills. Therefore, 'Poyer' should be tagged [IN] because he is part of the in-group team the commenter supports. The high win probability aligns with the positive tone of the comment, further indicating that Poyer is contributing to the in-group team's success.	The commenter is expressing their pleasure at seeing a player named Poyer back, likely referring to Jordan Poyer, who is a player for the Buffalo Bills. Since the comment is positive and indicative of support, and given that Poyer is on the in-group team (Bills), 'Poyer' should be tagged as [IN].	1668967503.0	bills	browns	Aypos		4.0	0.737955123186112	[5]

['them']	[(25, 29)]	['[OUT]']	The comment "Might want to let them score" is likely referring to the out-group team (Chiefs) as 'them'. This is a common strategy in football where a team might let their opponent score quickly to get the ball back with enough time to mount a comeback, which makes sense given the Bengals have a low win probability and might be considering drastic measures to turn the game around. Therefore, 'them' should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to the Chiefs.	The commenter suggests allowing their opponent to score, which implies a strategic decision typically considered for circumstances where conceding points to the opponent (out-group) might be beneficial — for example, to manage the clock. Here, 'them' refers to the opposing team, the Chiefs, and should therefore be tagged [OUT].	1643583396.0	bengals	chiefs	ResidentialEvil2016		3.0	0.272971034049988	[5]

However, fans often perceive them as biased or as making bad calls that hurt their team. In this context, the comment shows frustration towards the referees, not towards either the in-group (Chiefs) or the out-group (Titans). Despite the high win probability suggesting the in-group is performing well overall, the frustration is directed at the referees. Hence, "these refs" should be tagged as [OTHER] because referees are not part of any specific team.	In American football, referees are impartial officials who are neither aligned with the in-group nor the out-group teams. They make decisions and enforce rules during the game. Since the referees are not part of either the Chiefs (in-group) or the Titans (out-group), it is appropriate to tag 'these refs' as [OTHER]. The comment shows frustration with the referees, but this frustration is not directed at the opposing team, hence the labeling of 'these refs' as [OTHER] is accurate.	1667786184.0	chiefs	titans	livestrong10	Pat "Kermit" Mahomes	5.0	0.898366272449493	[5]

[SENT] gif 	['Justin Jefferson']	[(62, 78)]	['[OUT]']	Justin Jefferson is a player for the Vikings, which are the out-group team in this context. The comment expresses a desire for a player like Justin Jefferson, implicitly suggesting that the in-group (Giants) lacks a similar caliber receiver. Therefore, 'Justin Jefferson' should be tagged as [OUT]. The gif in the second sentence does not contain explicit textual references to any team or player, so it is not tagged. The win probability implies the Giants are not doing particularly well, which might explain yearning for a high-quality player from the opposing team.	The comment is expressing a desire for a top-tier wide receiver like Justin Jefferson. Since the commenter supports the Giants and the opponent is the Vikings, Justin Jefferson, who plays for the Vikings, is an out-group player. Thus, 'Justin Jefferson' should be tagged with [OUT]. The '[SENT]' tokens do not need to be tagged separately in this case as they do not explicitly reference the in-group, out-group, or other groups.	1671908988.0	giants	vikings	mac2po		8.0	0.304155230522156	[5]

The pronoun "our" further reinforces this as it demonstrates possession and support for the in-group team. The second sentence continues the discussion about the team's run game, which is part of the in-group's performance issues being discussed. The comment is implicitly about the in-group throughout both sentences, even though the second sentence does not contain a specific in-group referring expression. Hence, the sentence itself is tagged as [IN]. Therefore, "our offense", "our", and the second sentence "[SENT]" should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the in-group, the Cowboys.	The commenter is discussing issues related to their own team's performance, specifically the offense struggling due to an inability to establish a run game. The phrase "our offense" refers to the in-group team, the Cowboys, given the possessive "our." Therefore, "our offense" should be tagged [IN]. The second occurrence of "our" also refers to the in-group, thus it is tagged [IN]. The second sentence continues to discuss this issue without directly mentioning either team, but since it is implicit that the topic remains the performance of the in-group team, the [SENT] token is tagged [IN].	1638497660.0	cowboys	saints	MCMXXXX		3.0	0.6990681886672969	[5, 5, 5]

Given the high win probability, it is likely that Brady is performing well, prompting the commenter's affectionate reaction. Therefore, "brady" should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to a key player of the in-group Buccaneers.	Tom Brady is a player for the Buccaneers, the in-group team that the commenter supports. It is natural for a fan to express love and admiration towards a player from their own team. Therefore, the word 'brady' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	1667780761.0	buccaneers	rams	HS941317		3.0	0.93525405080265	[5]

The phrase 'how Njoku looks like a all world create a player yet has n't quite had it work out' reflects a negative evaluation of the out-group player. The win probability of 62.7% indicates that the in-group (Falcons) is likely ahead, but the commenter is focusing on a particular aspect of the opposing team's player performance. Therefore, Njoku is tagged with [OUT] as he refers to a member of the out-group.	The comment is discussing how Njoku has not performed as expected, despite looking like an excellent player. Since Njoku is a tight end for the Browns, the out-group team, 'Njoku' should be tagged with [OUT]. There are no other entities in the sentence that need tagging, and the comment is expressing disappointment about an out-group player, making the target and referring expressions accurate.	1664732591.0	falcons	browns	Subliminal-Ads		3.0	0.627019673585892	[5]

Given the high win probability, it's probable the Ravens are performing well, and the tone of "Lmaoo" suggests the commenter is amused or pleased by Moses' actions, which fans typically feel towards their own team's players. Therefore, 'Moses' should be tagged [IN], referring to the in-group team, the Ravens.	Moses likely refers to Morgan Moses, who is an offensive tackle for the Baltimore Ravens, the in-group for this commenter. Given the positive tone ("Lmaoo") and the fact that the comment highlights an entertaining moment from a specific player, it indicates that the commenter is enjoying a play made by their team's player. Therefore, 'Moses' should be tagged as [IN], since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1667873598.0	ravens	saints	mixedtwix		2.0	0.799331605434418	[5]

Since the in-group team is the Seahawks and Collins is a player for the Seahawks, the mention of "Collins" refers to an in-group player who executed a noteworthy play, despite the low win probability indicating that the Seahawks are likely losing. Therefore, "Collins" should be tagged [IN], as he is being lauded for his successful action directly benefiting the in-group team.	Collins is an in-group player for the Seahawks, and since the commenter is cheering for a successful play ('PUNCHED it in'), it indicates a positive action from the in-group player's perspective. Thus, 'Collins' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1634523001.0	seahawks	steelers	nerdgeekdorksports		3.0	0.09663344919681505	[5]

It is unlikely in this context that a supporter of the Cardinals would be so dismissive if they were referring to their own team. Given the very low win probability, the commenter is likely expressing frustration or disbelief about something related to the Rams, the out-group opponent. Therefore, "they" should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to the Rams.	The commenter is likely referring to the out-group team (Rams) losing last week, using the phrase "they literally just lost last week." Without additional context, 'they' here most probably refers to the recently defeated opponent, which is the Rams in this scenario. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the out-group.	1642473278.0	cardinals	rams			1.0	0.038358408957720025	[5]

Grady Jarrett is a well-known player for the Falcons, which is the in-group team that the commenter supports. Since both 'GRADY' and 'JARRETT' refer to the same player from the in-group (Falcons), they should be tagged with [IN].	The commenter is likely celebrating or acknowledging a player from the in-group team. GRADY and JARRETT refer to Grady Jarrett, who is a prominent player on the Falcons. Since the Falcons are the in-group team, 'GRADY' and 'JARRETT' should be tagged as [IN]. The use of 'MF' between the names suggests a strong emotional response, further indicating positive recognition toward an in-group player.	1631469091.0	falcons	eagles	sharia_shrek	:2:	9.0	0.481009364128113	[5, 5]

The comment refers to an anecdotal fact about his family, specifically mentioning 'arthur smiths'. Since it directly refers to a member of the in-group team's organization, 'arthur smiths' is correctly tagged as [IN].	Arthur Smith is the head coach of the Atlanta Falcons, and his father, Fred Smith, is the founder of FedEx. Since the commenter mentions "arthur smiths," it refers to someone associated with the in-group (Falcons), which they support. Therefore, "arthur smiths" should be tagged with [IN] as it clearly denotes an entity related to the in-group.

Given that the win probability for the in-group Cardinals is slightly above 50%, it suggests the team is currently doing relatively well. The use of the name "Eddy" is in a complimentary context, and fans commonly cheer on players from their own team using first names or nicknames. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that "Eddy" is a player from the in-group team, the Cardinals. Thus, "Eddy" should be tagged with [IN].	The commenter is complimenting a player named 'Eddy' on a nice run. Given that the commenter supports the Cardinals and is addressing Eddy directly with a positive comment ('Nice run'), it indicates that Eddy is likely a player from the in-group team, the Cardinals. Therefore, 'Eddy' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	1641163588.0	cardinals	cowboys	okram2k	:StLouis: St Louis Cardinals	2.0	0.552179932594299	[4]

[SENT] NFL network dicking those who do n't live in [IN] 	['Cleveland']	[(83, 92)]	['[IN]']	The comment is reflecting a frustration towards the NFL network, which would make sense if it is not showing the game for fans in certain regions. Given that the in-group team is the Browns, located in Cleveland, the part about "dicking those who don't live in Cleveland" implies that those outside the in-group fan region are missing out on something, likely the game. Therefore, "Cleveland" implicitly refers to the in-group team based on its location. The win probability is balanced, so there's no clear performance factor, but the focus here is on broadcast frustration, aligning with the in-group team's fan base. Hence, Cleveland is tagged as [IN].	The comment is about frustration with the NFL network, and specifically mentions 'Cleveland'. Since 'Cleveland' is the city associated with the in-group team the Browns, this phrase should be tagged with [IN]. The frustration seems to imply that the commenter is a Browns fan upset about the broadcast situation affecting those outside of Cleveland. So, 'Cleveland' correctly refers to the in-group with respect to the commenter. The first sentence does not contain any explicit references to the in-group, out-group, or other groups and is thus left untagged.	1671313469.0	browns	ravens	Kyrie2468	:cade:	10.0	0.501236855983734	[5]

[SENT] [IN] basically played a half and left . 	['[SENT]', 'They']	[(0, 6), (56, 60)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The win probability is 0.0%, suggesting that the in-group team, in this case, the Commanders, is almost certain to lose or has already lost. The first sentence does not contain explicit references to a specific team but discusses making plays in the second half, which can be implicitly tied to the in-group team, given the context of analyzing team performance. Thus, the first sentence is tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "They" refers to the in-group team, the Commanders, who seemingly performed well for only half the game before failing to continue. As such, it is appropriate to tag "They" with [IN], and therefore should be tagged in that context properly.	The first sentence is tagged [IN] even though it contains no specific words referring to any team because it implicitly expresses a concern or expectation about the in-group team's performance in the second half. The complaint in the second sentence is about a team that only played a half and left, a criticism that a fan would direct at their own team, hence it is tagged [IN]. 'They' refers to the in-group team (Commanders). Therefore, 'They' is tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	1634501423.0	commanders	washington	outspoken_ringer		1.0	0.0	[5, 5]

The comment laments the downturn in the season since a specific event involving Fant, a Broncos player. Despite not explicitly mentioning the in-group team, the emotional tone and context suggest that the commenter is referring to the Broncos' performance. The phrase "Fant Touchdown" references Noah Fant, who is a player for the Broncos, further reinforcing that the comment is about the in-group team. Because of this implicit reference, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN], and '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since it implicitly refers to the in-group team.	The comment is lamenting the poor performance of the team since a specific event, the "Fant Touchdown." Noah Fant is a player for the Broncos, so the commenter is likely a Broncos fan expressing frustration about the team's overall performance following that touchdown. Even though there is no explicit mention of the Broncos in this sentence, the context and specific reference imply it. Hence, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because the entire comment is implicitly referring to the in-group team, the Broncos.	1633886842.0	broncos	steelers	____whatever___	Demaryius Thomas	1.0	0.344584465026855	[4]

['we', 'Akers']	[(20, 22), (28, 33)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The word "we" typically refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports, in this case, the Rams. Commenters often use "we" to express their frustration or opinions about their own team. Cam Akers is a running back for the Rams, so "Akers" also refers to the in-group. The low win probability (15%) suggests that the Rams are not performing well, which might prompt such a comment about team decisions. Therefore, "we" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group, and "Akers" should also be tagged with [IN] since he is a player for the in-group team.	The commenter uses the word "we," which is typically used by fans to refer to the in-group team they support. This indicates that the commenter is a Rams fan. Additionally, 'Akers' refers to Cam Akers, a player for the Rams. Therefore, both 'we' and 'Akers' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group.	1670552039.0	rams	raiders	Daezuel	Isaac Bruce	7.0	0.149995803833008	[5, 5]

[SENT] [IN] has pretty clearly given up on the game and wants to just run out the clock to prevent more injuries . 	['Shanahan']	[(7, 15)]	['[IN]']	The commenter refers to 'Shanahan' who is the head coach of the 49ers, the in-group team. Given the very low win probability, it suggests that the 49ers are significantly behind in the game. The statement about Shanahan giving up on the game and wanting to run out the clock to prevent more injuries is a critique or observation related to the in-group tactics when losing badly. Hence, 'Shanahan' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a key figure within the in-group team.	Kyle Shanahan is the head coach of the 49ers, so any reference to him without additional context is understood to refer to the in-group team. In the comment, 'Shanahan' refers to the head coach of the 49ers, indicating that the action described (giving up on the game and wanting to run out the clock) is attributed to the commenter's in-group team. Hence, 'Shanahan' should be tagged with [IN].	1665949170.0	49ers	falcons	voldemortscore	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	8.0	0.03449418768286705	[5]

The usage of "LOVE" suggests a positive sentiment towards the play, and fans commonly express admiration for their own team's plays, especially in a game where the win probability is low, and they might be looking for positive moments. There is no explicit mention of any team, player, or entity, but the tone strongly suggests the commenter is praising their own team. Hence, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN], and '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since it implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Saints.	The comment expresses approval for a specific play ('LOVE the run up the middle on 2nd and 20'). Fans typically highlight and approve of strategic plays made by their own team rather than the opponent. Since this comment is expressing love for a play, it suggests the commenter is talking about their in-group team, the Saints. Although there is no explicit mention of the in-group in this sentence, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because the sentiment and context indicate support for the in-group's action. Hence, the whole sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group, supporting the choice of 'REF_EXPRESSIONS' as ['[SENT]'].	1638502207.0	saints	cowboys	Rampantlion513	Brees	2.0	0.205488219857216	[5]

Given the context:  The in-group team is the Bills, and the out-group team is the Lions.- The win probability for the Bills is relatively high at 70.4%, indicating they are likely leading or in a good position at the moment of the comment.The phrase "these guys" is disparagingly referring to the opponent team (out-group) since it points out their cockiness despite a poor record, aligning with typical fan sentiment against the opposing team. The overall context of the comment also suggests that the observer is thinking about the opponent's behavior, which could seem unwarranted given the current score or position in the game.Therefore, "these guys" should be tagged as [OUT], and the comment implicitly refers to the out-group (Lions), who the commenter feels are acting overconfident.The referring expression "these guys" is tagged as [OUT] because it refers disparagingly to the Lions (the out-group team) acting overly confident despite their poor 4-6 record. The high	The comment expresses disapproval or criticism of the behavior of the opponent, which would typically be directed towards the out-group. The phrase "these guys" refers to the team with a 4-6 record, which matches the performance of the out-group team, the Lions, in the context. Therefore, "these guys" is tagged as [OUT] since it refers to the out-group. The '[SENT]' token itself encompasses this sentiment and implicitly refers to the out-group Lions, hence the tag.	1669312176.0	bills	lions	Silent_Bobert		3.0	0.704402357339859	[4]

Even though the win probability is 0.0%, meaning the Eagles already lost, the comment is about the in-group's player, likely hinting at reasons for the team's poor performance. Therefore, 'Ward' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team player.	Ward is a player for the Eagles. The commenter supports the Eagles, and mentioning Ward going out with a back injury reflects concern or updates about their own team's player. Thus, 'Ward' should be tagged as [IN] since he is a member of the in-group with respect to the commenter.	1642365530.0	eagles	buccaneers	Ghstfce	:helmet: Season can't start soon enough	1.0	2.8252601623979245e-05	[3]

The win probability for the in-group is high, indicating that they are likely winning, but the commenter's anger suggests that a specific in-group play or decision was perceived as poor or unfair. Since the comment doesn't contain any explicit references to teams or players, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] to signify that the frustration is aimed at the in-group.	The comment 'Fucking absolutely ridiculous' is an expression of frustration which a fan is more likely to direct towards their own team's performance rather than the opponent's, especially given the charged language. Since there is no explicit word or phrase that refers to the in-group, the sentence itself '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] to capture the implicit reference to the in-group team.	1666553847.0	ravens	browns			3.0	0.897266983985901	[5]

[SENT] [IN] should have gotten points there . [SENT] lul 	['Jimmy', 'We']	[(9, 14), (133, 135)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is a supporter of the 49ers, who are playing against the Chiefs. The first sentence mentions "Jimmy," which likely refers to Jimmy Garoppolo, the quarterback for the 49ers, thus "Jimmy" should be tagged as [IN]. Despite the low win probability, the commenter is stating that Garoppolo is playing well overall. The third sentence uses "we," a clear and direct in-group reference to the 49ers because fans often use "we" to refer to their own team, especially when discussing what the team could or should have done. Thus "we" should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence about the endzone interception (INT) happening regardless of it ending in no score is a general statement and lacks a specific reference requiring tagging. The exclamation "lul" in the last sentence is a laughter representation and does not contain any specific reference to tag. Therefore, the sentences and tags are correct with "Jimmy" and "We" being appropriately labeled as in-group references.	The commenter mentions "Jimmy" in a positive context, indicating support. Since Jimmy Garoppolo is a player for the 49ers, the reference "Jimmy" should be tagged as [IN]. The use of "We" in the third sentence also implies the in-group (the 49ers) since fans typically use "we" to refer to the team they support. Therefore, the word "we" should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence doesn't explicitly reference any team or player, but it discusses a pivotal moment in the game, which is contextually about the in-group. However, since there are no specific names or pronouns in that sentence, no specific tags are applied. The last sentence, "lul," is just an expression of amusement and doesn't require any tag. Thus, the correctly tagged elements are "Jimmy" and "We," both as [IN].	1666567384.0	49ers	chiefs	SleepIsWonderful	:classicfont: 49ers	-1.0	0.0003293746267445	[5, 5]

Given the context, the in-group is the Jaguars, and the win probability is very low, suggesting a difficult situation for the team. In the first sentence, "Jags fans" directly refers to fans of the Jaguars, the team the commenter supports, making it an in-group reference. The second sentence continues to express solidarity, implicitly referring to the in-group without explicitly mentioning them.Thus, "Jags fans" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. The rest of the comment is implicitly about the in-group, fitting within the in-group context properly.	The commenter is acknowledging and commending fans of the in-group team, the Jaguars ('Jags'), who are attending the game. Therefore, 'Jags' should be tagged [IN] as it is a shorthand for the Jaguars, the team the commenter supports. While the second sentence does not explicitly mention any team, it implicitly continues the sentiment directed towards the in-group fans, indicated by the use of 'you', which refers back to the Jags fans. Thus, there are no tags needed in the second sentence for it to be understood as referring implicitly to the in-group fans.	1637522048.0	jaguars	49ers	1tinywalrus		7.0	0.033772349357605	[5]

The win probability for the in-group (Chiefs) is very high, which implies they are performing well. This allows the commenter to turn attention to the Steelers, possibly making a sarcastic remark about their performance. The word 'They' in the first sentence and 'claypool' should be tagged as [OUT] since they refer to the out-group (Steelers). The second sentence is discussing the Steelers' performance implicitly by suggesting the creation of a montage of their plays, hence '[SENT]' should also be tagged as [OUT].	The comment is about the Steelers, since 'They' in the first sentence refers to the team that should employ a certain strategy, suggesting the out-group in this case. 'claypool' is a player for the Steelers, thus tagged with [OUT]. The second sentence lacks an explicit reference to the out-group but clearly continues to talk about the same team strategy, so the [SENT] token should be tagged [OUT].	1640557182.0	chiefs	steelers	heynongmanreset		3.0	0.960448388010263	[5, 5, 5]

The commenter is likely referring to James Conner, who is a running back for the Arizona Cardinals, the in-group team the commenter supports.

'They' appears to refer to the coaching staff or decision-makers of the in-group team (Raiders), as it is common for fans to use 'they' to refer to their own team's management or coaching staff when making critical comments. 'Jackson' is likely a player on the Raiders, given that the focus of the comment is on his usage in the game, and the commenter seems to be expressing frustration that he is not being utilized effectively. The pronoun 'he' subsequently refers to Jackson, further discussing his experience and usage, reinforcing that it pertains to the Raiders' team. Therefore, 'They', 'Jackson', and 'he' should all be tagged as [IN] referring to the in-group.	The commenter is criticizing the coaching strategy of their in-group team. The complaint about Jackson's limited routes and playtime implies dissatisfaction with their own team's decisions. Therefore, 'They' refers to the in-group team (Raiders), who are making those coaching decisions. 'Jackson' is likely a player on the in-group team, as the commenter is familiar with his history and playtime, which suggests he is a player they follow closely. 'he' refers back to Jackson, reinforcing that it's an in-group reference. Thus, 'They', 'Jackson', and 'he' should all be tagged [IN].	1640048191.0	raiders	browns	dahomie_longstroke		1.0	0.39177647233009305	[5, 5, 5]

Fans typically refer to their own team simply as "this team" without specifying the name because it is implied who they are talking about, especially in a discussion environment where participants know each other's affiliations. The win probability is relatively low, suggesting that the commenter might be frustrated or experiencing mixed emotions about the game's progress, hence the "roller-coaster" description. Thus, "this team" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the 49ers.	The phrase "this team" in the comment is likely referring to the in-group team (49ers) that the commenter supports, as fans typically refer to their own team in a general sense when describing their experience watching them. Thus, "this team" should be tagged as [IN]. There is an emotional tone ("damn roller-coaster") which suggests a personal investment usually reserved for the in-group.

'McKinnon' is a running back for the Chiefs, and the mention of his strong run game last year indicates that the commenter's sentiment is positive towards him. Thus, 'McKinnon' should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, 'he' refers back to McKinnon, so it should be tagged as [IN] as well. The mention of 'Brown' likely refers to Orlando Brown Jr., an offensive tackle for the Chiefs known for blocking; thus, 'Brown' should also be tagged [IN]. Additionally, the context of talking about player performance and improvements (i.e., pulling and down-field blocking) supports the idea that these references are to in-group players, despite the relatively low win probability suggesting the game is not going well at the moment.	McKinnon is a running back for the Chiefs, and since the commenter is a Chiefs supporter, 'McKinnon' is an in-group reference and should be tagged [IN]. The pronoun 'he' refers back to McKinnon, thus it should also be tagged [IN]. Brown refers to another player on the Chiefs, which suggests he is a member of the in-group as well; thus, 'Brown' should also be tagged [IN].

Since the comment is a critique in the context of NFL gameplay, it is likely directed towards the in-group's (Packers) defensive strategy. The explicit mention of 'Ryan Tannehill' is a reference to an out-group player, so it is correctly tagged as [OUT]. The critique does not directly refer to any specific entity of the in-group defense in terms of explicit words or phrases; hence the only tagged expression needed is 'Ryan Tannehill' as [OUT].	The comment is lamenting a defensive strategy, which suggests frustration with the in-group's play-calling. The phrase "Love playing 7 yards off into a zone every play" without any additional qualifications indicates that the commenter is likely referring to their in-group team's strategy. Ryan Tannehill is the quarterback for the Titans, the out-group opponent in this context. Thus, "Ryan Tannehill" should be tagged with [OUT], as he is a player for the opposing team. There is no explicit mention of the in-group, but the strategy critique is implicitly about their own team's performance. Therefore, the comment attributes the strategic decision to the in-group, but the explicit reference to Ryan Tannehill is accurately tagged as [OUT].	1668738735.0	packers	titans	Sqwilly50		14.0	0.245930016040802	[5]

Therefore, "Colts" should be tagged as [OTHER]. The phrase "please fuck them up" is directed at the Bills (the in-group) to encourage them to defeat the Patriots (the out-group). However, since the explicit mention is of "Colts fans" and not the in-group or out-group directly, it is tagged as [OTHER]. In the second sentence, "that stupid ass fanbase" is referring to the Patriots' fanbase, but there is no direct mention in the sentence that needs tagging. Thus, the target is correct, and the referring expression "Colts" correctly identified for the [OTHER] tag.	The game is between the Bills and the Patriots, and the commenter supports the Bills. 'Colts' refers to a team that is neither the Bills nor the Patriots. Thus, they are an 'OTHER' team within the context. The second sentence doesn't contain any explicit references to either the in-group or out-group but is likely referring to the out-group's fanbase (the Patriots' fanbase, in this case). However, since the comment is specifically addressing 'Colts' fans, the absence of a direct out-group mention in the second sentence means we don't need to add a specific tag for it. Therefore, 'Colts' is correctly tagged as [OTHER], and no additional tagging is required.	1640542019.0	bills	patriots	ThrowAOSI	:IND:	5.0	0.560490548610687	[5]

However, given the in-group team is the 49ers and the win probability is relatively high, fans are probably feeling confident and might be making fun of the out-group. In this context, the "Jimmy chant" can be seen as referencing the out-group to ridicule or taunt them, making "Jimmy" tagged as [OUT]. Hence, "Jimmy" should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the out-group in this taunting context, even if it might have been originally intended to reference the in-group player Jimmy Garoppolo.	The name 'Jimmy' likely refers to Jimmy Garoppolo, who is a player for the 49ers. However, since the commenter is a 49ers fan and the chant is happening from the stands behind the commenter, it is reasonable to infer that the chant is likely mocking or focused on an opposing team's context. In this case, 'Jimmy' should be tagged [OUT] because it is referring to an opposing entity in the context of this fan, who supports the 49ers. The comment implicitly points out behavior related to the out-group, thus 'Jimmy' should be tagged with [OUT].	1641162577.0	49ers	texans	cyntaf	:jerseyhome13: Brock Purdy	11.0	0.692940533161163	[3]

[IN] Shoukda had that 	['[SENT]']	[(13, 19)]	['[IN]']	The high win probability (77.2%) suggests that the in-group, Falcons, are performing well, and this comment likely refers to a missed opportunity by them. The word "Shoukda" is an informal, slang contraction of "Should have," creating the sense that the commenter is lamenting a missed opportunity. Given no explicit mention of a team or player from the out-group or any other team, and based on the context and the supportive nature of the comment, it can be inferred that the comment implicitly refers to the Falcons. Therefore, the second sentence implies a missed opportunity by the in-group team, Falcons, making "[SENT]" tagged with [IN]. The first sentence, "Wow," is neutral and not specific to any team; hence it does not need tagging in this context.	The commenter expresses frustration or disappointment with the statement "Shoukda had that," implying that a player from the in-group (Falcons) missed an opportunity or failed to make a play. Since fans typically discuss their own team's missed opportunities this way, the second sentence is referring to the in-group implicitly even though there is no explicit mention of an in-group entity. Therefore, the entire second sentence should be tagged [IN].	1633290633.0	falcons	washington	pixieinrome	My Man Matty Mahomes	1.0	0.77197676897049	[5]

[SENT] I still feel like # 1 seed is a pipe dream unless [IN] actually pull this game out 	['they', 'they']	[(57, 61), (174, 178)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The low win probability suggests that the in-group (Cowboys) is currently losing, which aligns with the commenter's concern expressed in the first sentence about the game trending in the "loss direction". The commenter emphasizes the urgency for the team to get a win on Thanksgiving, making it clear they are talking about the Cowboys, the in-group team. The second sentence further expresses doubt about achieving the #1 seed unless they manage to win the current game, which again refers to the Cowboys. Given the context, the pronoun "they" in both sentences is implicitly referring to the in-group team (Cowboys). Hence, "they" should be tagged as [IN] and no other entities are present in the sentences that refer to the out-group or other teams.	The commenter is discussing the necessity of their team to win future games, indicating an investment in the performance and results of the in-group, which is the Cowboys. The phrase "they have to absolutely have to get the W on thanksgiving" suggests the commenter is supporting the in-group team, expressing a sense of urgency for them to win. The subsequent use of "unless they actually pull this game out" further reflects concern about the in-group's performance in the current game. Therefore, both instances of "they" should be tagged as [IN], since they refer to the Cowboys. There are no explicit mentions of the out-group or other teams, reinforcing the focus on the in-group.	1637533486.0	cowboys	chiefs	Satans_asshol3	Connor Williams	2.0	0.09530705213546797	[5, 5]

[SENT] [IN] has been a disaster since 1963 , but it 's all on Quinn and Patricia . 	['This team']	[(20, 29)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is likely talking about the in-group in this context given the overall negative tone and the low win probability, hinting at frustration. "This team" refers to the Lions (in-group), as indicated by the historical reference to 1963, which aligns with the lengthy frustration Lions fans may have. The mention of Quinn and Patricia, former Lions' executives, further supports that the team in question is the Lions. Hence, "This team" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter's statement about the team being a disaster since 1963 without specifying which team indicates that the commenter assumes the audience knows which team they are referring to, which is typically the in-group team they support. Given this context, 'This team' implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Lions. Therefore, 'This team' should be tagged as [IN], reflecting the commenter's in-group perspective.	1635705357.0	lions	eagles	EdgeCrusher1		1.0	0.0314590334892273	[5]

The win probability is relatively low, indicating the team might not be doing well, and thus the fan is trying to motivate them. "Flight Force" is a nickname commonly used for the Jets, aligning with aviation-themed language. Therefore, "FLIGHT FORCE" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Jets.	The phrase "LETS GOO" is an expression of excitement and support, commonly directed towards the in-group team by fans. "FLIGHT FORCE" is likely a nickname or term of endearment for the Jets, considering the in-group team here is the Jets, which matches with the aviation theme ("Jets" -> "Flight Force"). Therefore, "FLIGHT FORCE" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	1637517788.0	jets	dolphins	BryLinds	:OtherJoeDStoneCold: Stone Cold Joe Douglas	2.0	0.374773800373077	[5]

The win probability is extremely low, indicating the team is not performing well, and the comment mentions Crowder giving up a TD, in a slightly mocking or frustrated tone evidenced by the "lol." This aligns with a common reaction of criticizing one's own team or players when the performance is poor. Therefore, 'Crowder' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player on the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter likely supports the Giants, as indicated by the in-group. Crowder is a player for the Giants, and the comment critiques his performance ("immediately gives up a TD lol"), which is something a fan might say about their own team's player. Thus, 'Crowder' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player, making the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS correctly tagged.	1670789458.0	giants	eagles	BlackOriginThreshold		3.0	0.007435643570362	[5]

['we', 'white']	[(15, 17), (29, 34)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment reflects a critique of decisions made by the in-group team, the Raiders. The phrase "Why did we even draft" suggests that the commenter is expressing frustration about a draft pick made by the team they support, hence 'we' is tagged as [IN]. The name 'white' refers to a player drafted by the Raiders, which aligns with the critique regarding their draft decisions. As a result, 'white' should also be tagged with [IN] because the player's performance or utility is being questioned in the context of the in-group team's decision-making. The second sentence does not have a clear referring expression but continues the sentiment of frustration, likely with the same context in mind, but no new entities to tag. Therefore, 'we' and 'white' properly capture the entities being referred to in the context of the comment, both tagged [IN].	The commenter is questioning the decision of their own team's draft pick, indicated by the use of "we" which refers to the in-group team the commenter supports (Raiders). 'white' is referring to a player that the Raiders drafted. Therefore, 'we' and 'white' should both be tagged as [IN], referring to the in-group team. The second sentence is a follow-up question that implicitly refers to the same in-group situation but does not have an explicit tagged expression.	1667764675.0	raiders	jaguars	bproofstk		13.0	0.7288492918014531	[5, 5]

Given that 'we' in such contexts almost always refers to the in-group, the commenter is referring to the 49ers who are performing at a level that leaves them tied with their opponent, the Falcons. This sentiment aligns with the relatively high win probability of 75.9%, suggesting the commenter sees a tie as a positive outcome considering previous drama. Thus, 'we' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The word 'we' typically refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. Here, 'we' signifies the 49ers as the commenter is happy to accept a tie score, implying they are speaking from the perspective of a 49ers fan.

The high win probability implies the Seahawks are likely doing well, so the commenter is making a comment related to a specific player's long-term performance rather than the immediate outcome. 'Sidney Jones' should be tagged [IN] since he is a member of the in-group. 'He' and 'he' should also be tagged [IN] as they both refer back to Sidney Jones, who is part of the in-group.	The comment suggests frustration but still supports a specific player, Sidney Jones, who is being given the benefit of the doubt. Sidney Jones plays for the Seahawks, the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Sidney Jones' should be tagged as [IN] as it refers to an in-group player. The pronoun 'He' and 'he' in the following sentence also refer to Sidney Jones and consequently should also be tagged as [IN] since each pronoun is a reference to the same in-group player. This is confirmed by the positive description of the player's promise and potential for improvement, indicating in-group support.	1633299561.0	seahawks	49ers	ShinyBulk		36.0	0.83781236410141	[5, 5, 5]

Given that the Patriots are the in-group team, the commenter would most likely be expressing frustration or disbelief at something negative related to their team. The win probability of 58% indicates the game is relatively close, and the commenter's reaction implies something surprising related to their team. Since there is no explicit mention of either team, the whole sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN], indicating an implicit reference to the in-group team, the Patriots.	The commenter is expressing shock or disbelief, a reaction likely prompted by their own team's (in-group's) performance. Since there is no explicit mention of a team or player, the sentence as a whole ([SENT]) is tagged as [IN]. This indicates the reaction pertains to the in-group (Patriots) implicitly.	1668977786.0	patriots	jets	Jay_Louis		2.0	0.580494701862335	[5]

Since there is no explicit mention of the Eagles or any of their players, the entire sentence is tagged to imply it is about the in-group. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' to reflect the implicit criticism of the Eagles.	The comment 'Horrible decision making' is a criticism, which a fan is more likely to direct towards their own team (the in-group) rather than the opponent (the out-group). Given the lack of explicit mention of any team, player, or coach, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is implicitly referring to the in-group team, the Eagles.

Given the context, the commenter is suggesting using JT more, which indicates a strategy to be implemented by the in-group. The win probability being extremely high suggests that the team is already doing very well, further reinforcing that the commenter is focused on the Colts and considering optimal choices for their continued success. Hence, 'JT' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team. The other sentences don't explicitly mention any specific entities but are implicitly referring to decisions or strategies related to the in-group team, the Colts.	'JT' refers to Jonathan Taylor, a well-known player on the Colts roster. Since the commenter is suggesting that the in-group team (Colts) should use JT more, it indicates that they are talking about someone from their own team. Thus, 'JT' should be tagged with [IN]. The rest of the comment doesn't specify any particular team or player, so no further specific tags are necessary outside of the 'JT' reference tagged as [IN].	1634497616.0	colts	texans	ricker182		8.0	0.986475834549146	[5]

Given that the commenter is a Lions supporter, this phrase is almost certainly directed towards the in-group team. The win probability being slightly above 50% suggests a competitive but optimistic outlook, which aligns with the motivational tone of the comment. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since it is an implicit cheer for the Lions, the in-group team.	The phrase "Let's go baby" is a cheer or rallying cry, and it is something fans commonly use to support and encourage their own team.

['Giants', 'the Bears']	[(7, 13), (36, 45)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	The comment compares the talent levels of the Giants and the Bears. Given the low win probability, the Bears (the in-group in this context) are likely struggling, leading the commenter to make a negative comparison.The first part of the comment mentions the "Giants" and "the Bears", with the "Giants" being the out-group team and "the Bears" being the in-group team according to the input parameters. The statement that the Giants have more talent implies a direct comparison where the commenter acknowledges the out-group team (Giants) as superior in talent compared to the in-group team (Bears).The second sentence, "That's sad," reflects the commenter's disappointment, which is directed towards their own team, in this context, the Bears (in-group).Therefore, 'Giants' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team and 'the Bears' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team. The win probability being low suggests that the comparison is likely intended to highlight the underperformance of the Bears, aligning with the tags and referring expressions provided.The comment compares the talent levels of the Giants and the Bears, with the commenter supporting the Bears (in-group) and expressing disappointment	The commenter mentions two specific teams: the Giants and the Bears. Since the Bears are the in-group team the commenter supports, it is implied that the commenter is comparing their team unfavorably to the Giants. In the first sentence, 'Giants' refers to the out-group opponent team, and 'the Bears' refers to the in-group team. The use of "That's sad" in the second sentence expresses a negative sentiment aligned with the commenter's disappointment in their own team, the Bears, relative to the out-group. So, 'Giants' should be tagged as [OUT] and 'the Bears' as [IN].In the second sentence "That's sad," there is no explicit reference to a specific team, but it follows directly from the previous sentence's context, which involves a comparison between the in-group and out-group teams. Since the sentiment reflects the commenter's feelings about the in-group (Bears) being less talented, the overall context pertains to the in-group.Therefore, tagging 'Giants' as [OUT], 'the Bears' as [IN], and correctly splitting the sentences as indicated captures the intended meaning accurately.	1664739768.0	bears	giants			4.0	0.12996697425842296	[5, 5]

This pronoun usage is a common way for fans to refer to their team. Despite the low in-group win probability, the commenter is finding a positive aspect, possibly hinting at getting a chance to see a lesser-used player ('little play'), which reflects a fan's perspective. Thus, 'we' is tagged [IN] as it denotes the in-group.	The use of 'we' indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, which in this case is the Jaguars. Fans typically use 'we' to refer to their in-group team, indicating a shared identity and support.

The win probability is relatively low for the Ravens, implying they need a defensive play to potentially turn the game around. This comment is implicitly referring to the in-group performing the defensive stop, despite not explicitly mentioning the Ravens. Therefore, the sentence itself should be tagged as [IN] and the tag '[SENT]' as the referring expression, signifying that the entire sentence is about wanting the in-group to make a crucial defensive play.	The comment is hoping for a third down stop, which is a defensive play to prevent the opposing team from advancing or scoring. Since the commenter is rooting for the Ravens (the in-group) to make this stop, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group without explicitly mentioning them.

['they']	[(15, 19)]	['[OUT]']	The commenter is expressing frustration or jealousy about another team being in the Super Bowl, which implies that they are speaking about the out-group, the Eagles, given the context of an NFL game and the in-group being the Chiefs. Since the in-group team is not performing well evidenced by the low win probability, the commenter seems to be bitter about the out-group's success. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the Eagles, the out-group opponent.	The comment's tone suggests frustration or disbelief about a team making it to the Super Bowl again. Given that the in-group is the Chiefs, the comment is likely referring to the out-group team, the Eagles, being in the Super Bowl. 'they' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group.	1676250423.0	chiefs	eagles	Bhay99	Chiefs	1.0	0.22457957267761197	[5]

Even though the win probability is relatively low for the in-group Ravens in this instance, it suggests that the commenter is trying to rally the team or fans. The term "BOYS" is a common informal reference used by fans to speak about their own team or players, creating a sense of camaraderie and support. Therefore, "BOYS" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The comment uses an enthusiastic and inclusive phrase "GET IN HERE BOYS," which indicates excitement or a rallying call. This is something a fan would say to rally support or celebrate with fellow fans of their team. The term "BOYS" is a common informal way to refer to members of one's own team or fellow fans.

'you' in this context is likely referring to an in-group player who made this error, as it is common for fans to use 'you' when addressing their own team directly. 'Him' refers to the out-group player who was touched. Despite the win probability being 100% indicating that the in-group team (Dolphins) has essentially won, the commenter is criticizing this specific action, which led to stopping the clock and is described as a terrible move. Hence, 'you' is tagged [IN], and 'him' is tagged [OUT].	The commenter is likely frustrated with a player from the in-group (Dolphins) for touching an out-group (Jaguars) player and thus stopping the clock, which they think is a bad decision. 'you' is a common way for fans to refer to their own players, showing a direct and personal investment. On the other hand, 'him' refers to the opposing player whose clock-stopping touch was involved. Hence, 'you' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a Dolphins player, and 'him' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to a Jaguars player.	1634489826.0	dolphins	jaguars	lemmegetfrieswitdat		2.0	1.0	[5, 5]

The win probability is low, suggesting the Cowboys are struggling, further implying that "an offense" refers to the out-group, the Buccaneers. Therefore, 'an offense' should be tagged [OUT], as it refers to the opponent team Buccaneers.	The sentence "Ca n't do that against an offense this good" implies that the commenter is acknowledging the strength of the opponent's offense. Since the commenter supports the Cowboys and the opponent is the Buccaneers, it is logical to tag 'an offense' as [OUT], referring to the Buccaneers' strong offense. The complaint about the team's actions is in context of the out-group's capabilities, thus reinforcing that 'an offense' should be tagged as [OUT].	1631234143.0	cowboys	buccaneers	mps2000		3.0	0.224311262369156	[5]

'Gute' likely refers to Brian Gutekunst, the General Manager of the Packers. Since 'this team' refers to the team being managed by Gute, it should be tagged as [IN]. The phrase indicates a critical view towards the in-group team, suggesting they are playing poorly enough that it looks like they are aiming for a high draft pick, despite their current likelihood of winning being relatively high. This is a reflection of the commenter's focus on management rather than immediate performance.Therefore, 'this team' is correctly tagged as [IN], referring to the in-group (Packers).	The phrase 'this team' is referring to the way the in-group team, the Packers, is being managed poorly according to the commenter. They are mentioning 'Gute' (likely referring to Brian Gutekunst, the Packers' general manager) and critique his management in a sarcastic manner, implying poor performance.

The win probability is high, indicating that the Jets are likely doing well in the game. The enthusiastic tone ("HAS FUCKING GUTS") and the high win probability suggest the commenter is celebrating a successful drive led by their in-group team's player. Therefore, 'ZW' refers to Zach Wilson of the Jets and should be tagged as [IN]. '[SENT]' does not need further tagging as the entire sentence implicitly supports the in-group team.	The commenter is likely celebrating a successful drive by praising a player from the in-group team (Jets). 'ZW' refers to Zach Wilson, the quarterback for the Jets. Since 'ZW' is a player on the in-group team, it should be tagged with [IN].

Since 'this defense' is mentioned without qualification, it is reasonable to assume it refers to the defense of the in-group team (Packers). The subsequent sentence provides tactics that could give 'us' (the in-group) a small chance at winning, indicating the commenter believes the team they're supporting requires a defensive stop and is thus referencing the same defense. The overall context shows frustration but also a glimmer of hope for the in-group team. Therefore, 'this defense', 'they', and 'we' should be tagged as [IN] because they all refer to the in-group (Packers). The win probability suggests underdog status but doesn't change the reference context significantly here.The commenter expresses sympathy for 'this defense,' which without qualification likely refers to their own team's (Packers) defense. The next sentence discusses needing the defense to make a stop to give 'we' (Packers) a chance, indicating these refer to the in-group team. Thus, 'this defense', 'they', and 'we' should be tagged with [IN], reflecting the in-group team.	The commenter is expressing sympathy for 'this defense' and hoping for defensive success to help their team, indicating they are talking about their in-group. 'this defense' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group. 'they' also refers to the in-group defense, implying a desire for them to perform well and gain possession. 'we' should be tagged [IN] as it shows the commenter is talking about their own team having a shot at winning.

The phrase 'the lions' is an explicit mention of the in-group team. The repeated use of 'we' throughout the comment strongly suggests the commenter is a fan of the Lions and is referring to the in-group team. The win probability is relatively low, indicating the Lions might be struggling, which aligns with the comment's sentiment about not winning the second half consistently. Therefore, each instance of 'we' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the Lions.	The phrase 'the lions' explicitly refers to the in-group team the commenter supports and should therefore be tagged as [IN]. The use of 'we' in consecutive parts of the sentence also implicitly refers to the in-group; fans typically use 'we' to describe their own team's performance.

The Falcons had a bad drive, and the commenter goes on to criticize their own team's offense for not managing to get a first down and subsequently putting their defense back on the field. The win probability is relatively balanced at 48%, suggesting a closer game where either team could be doing better or worse at different moments. In this context, "Defense", referring to the Falcons' defense having a bad drive, should be tagged as [IN]. "We" clearly includes the commenter, signifying the in-group team (Falcons), and hence should be tagged [IN]. "They" and "the defense" also refer to the performative aspects of the in-group team, continuing the criticism of their gameplay, so they should also be tagged with [IN].	The commenter is discussing the performance of their own team, the Falcons, during the game against the Chargers. 1. In the first sentence, "Defense" refers to the Falcons' defensive unit that had a bad drive. Therefore, "Defense" is tagged as [IN].2. The pronoun "We" in the second sentence indicates that the commenter is talking about their own team, hence it is tagged as [IN].3. "They" in the third sentence also refers to the Falcons, as it discusses the team putting their own defense back on the field quickly. Thus, it is tagged as [IN].4. "The defense" in the third sentence again refers to the Falcons' defensive unit that is being repeatedly put back on the field in a detrimental manner, and so it is tagged as [IN].Thus, the correct tagged output and list of referring expressions are as stated, reflecting that all mentioned entities refer to the in-group team, the Falcons.	1667761426.0	falcons	chargers	QuiGonFishin		1.0	0.479539394378662	[5, 5, 5, 5]

Since 'Bills' is the opponent team, it should be tagged [OUT]. The commenter mentions McDermott, who is the coach of the Bills, so 'McDermott' should also be tagged [OUT]. The first sentence expresses what the commenter would do if they were a fan of the Bills, hence 'Bills' and 'McDermott' are tagged [OUT]. The second sentence criticizes the decision indirectly addressed in the first sentence, and since it doesn't explicitly mention the in-group or out-group team, it remains untagged.	The comment expresses what the commenter would feel if they were a fan of the out-group team (Bills), clearly suggesting frustration with decisions made by McDermott, who is associated with the Bills. Hence, 'Bills' and 'McDermott' should be tagged with [OUT]. The second sentence does not name the team but describes a negative play ('that punt'), which implicitly refers to the out-group based on the context provided in the first sentence about the Bills. Thus, no explicit tag for the second sentence is necessary, but the entities explicitly named are correctly tagged as [OUT].	1639352753.0	buccaneers	bills	INAC_Kramerica	:bucsoldship: 	2.0	0.954738318920135	[5, 5]

Despite not having explicit team references in this sentence, it implies instructions or considerations for the in-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' in the first sentence should be tagged [IN].The second sentence includes 'them' and 'us'. 'them' refers to the out-group team, the Packers, as the commenter is referring to their difficulty in kicking a field goal. 'us' refers to the in-group team, the Chiefs, mentioning their challenges in punting under windy conditions. Thus, 'them' is tagged [OUT] and 'us' is tagged [IN]. The overall commentary reflects the in-group's perspective on the difficulties faced by both teams due to the wind.	The first sentence in the comment implies a strategic decision concerning the in-group team, and no explicit entities are mentioned, so the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, 'them' refers to the opposing team, the Packers, making it [OUT]. The word 'us' refers to the in-group team, Chiefs, so it is tagged as [IN]. In summary, the taggings are correct because the first sentence is implicitly about the in-group, while the second has explicit references to both the in-group and out-group.	1636322330.0	chiefs	packers	uwanmirrondarrah	Patrick Mahomes #2	5.0	0.893106281757355	[5, 5, 5]

The excitement expressed in the comment ("LOOKING LIKE A REAL NFL TEAM OMG") indicates that the commenter is pleased with the performance of their own team. Despite the win probability being relatively low (40.7%), which suggests that the game is competitive, the comment reflects a positive observation about the in-group team. Therefore, "WERE" should be tagged with [IN], and the rest of the sentence implicitly supports the in-group team. This justifies the target tagging of the entire sentence with [IN].	The use of "WERE" in the comment suggests that the commenter is talking about their own team, especially since the statement is positive, indicating unexpected improvement ("LOOKING LIKE A REAL NFL TEAM OMG"). Fans typically express surprise and excitement about their own team's performance.

The win probability is relatively neutral, but the exasperation in the comment suggests frustration with the out-group's current quarterback performance, which is implied to be good given the "37 td 4 int" statistic. 'the packers' clearly refers to the out-group team, hence it is tagged [OUT]. This demonstrates the wishful thinking and rivalry feelings related to the opposing team.	The commenter is referencing a specific player statistic (37 touchdowns and 4 interceptions), and then directly refers to 'the packers', indicating a desire for the Packers to experience having a poor quarterback for a change. Since the comment wishes ill upon the Packers, and the Lions are the in-group team, 'the packers' is clearly referring to the out-group opponent and should be tagged [OUT].

Given that the in-group team is the Broncos, the first two sentences should be implicitly tagged with [IN] because the criticism ('6 first half points' and 'Pat Shurmur') refers to the Broncos' performance. Pat Shurmur being mentioned might have a historical or contextual relevance to the Broncos' offensive struggles, which is why it would be a reference to the in-group. In the third sentence, the commenter sarcastically mentions playing against a 'tough defense', which implies that the excuse for the poor performance is the strength of the opponent's defense. The use of 'we' confirms that the commenter is speaking from the perspective of a Broncos' fan. Thus, 'we' should be tagged as [IN] as it references the in-group. Overall, the comments are all about the Broncos' performance, directly or indirectly pointing towards the in-group's struggles.Therefore, the correct tagged output and list of referring expressions are justified as follows: - The first sentence '6 first half points .' and 'Pat Shurmur would be proud .' are implicitly about the Broncos, hence tagged [IN].- 'we' in the	The commenter is likely a Broncos fan criticizing their team's performance for having only 6 first-half points and sarcastically mentioning Pat Shurmur, who was previously their offensive coordinator and often blamed for poor results, thereby indicating they are talking about their own team. When they say, "at least it's because we are playing such a tough defense," 'we' refers to the in-group team (Broncos), as the commenter is justifying the poor score by attributing it to the tough defense of the out-group team (Texans). Therefore, '[SENT]' for the first and second sentence, and 'we' in the third sentence should be tagged [IN] since the commenter is referring to their own team (Broncos). The third sentence '[SENT]' does not contain an explicit reference, so it also should be tagged [IN], expressing the same sentiment as the previous sentences.	1663538236.0	broncos	texans	Da-Bandit		7.0	0.735107153654099	[5, 5, 5]

The in-group is the Rams, and the win probability is very low, indicating a tough season. The word "we" almost universally refers to the team the commenter supports, which in this case is the Rams. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN], and the entire sentence reflects dissatisfaction with the in-group's performance, leading to the correct tag [IN] for the sentence.	'we' in the comment typically refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.

Since 'GB team' is a direct reference to the in-group team, the Packers, it should be tagged as [IN]. The mention of "Rodgers" refers to Aaron Rodgers, a well-known player for the Packers, providing additional context that confirms the commenter is talking about the in-group team. Despite the high win probability suggesting that the Packers are likely doing well in the game, the commenter focuses on their perception of the team's entertainment value. Therefore, "GB team" is tagged correctly as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, the Packers.	The commenter is likely referring to the Packers, indicated by 'GB team'. Since 'GB' commonly stands for Green Bay, and the in-group team is the Packers, the phrase 'GB team' refers to the in-group.

Since the commenter is a supporter of the Eagles, any mention of Wilson would be considered as referring to the out-group. The high win probability for the Eagles suggests they are likely having a good game, and the comment "got DESTROYED" indicates that a significant negative event happened to Wilson, further implying he is part of the out-group.

Despite the low win probability suggesting the Broncos are losing, the statement compares an in-group player to another player, with the implication that the in-group player is still relatively better. Horne, on the other hand, does not play for the Panthers but the Carolina Panthers' player Jaycee Horn, which implies this refers to a third party not directly involved in the current game. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged as [IN] referring to the in-group player's identity as perceived by the commenter, and 'Horne' as [OTHER] since he is neither a Broncos nor Panthers player.	The commenter is referring to a player from the Broncos (the in-group) by 'he,' asserting that this player is deemed better than Horne. Horne is a player for the Panthers (the out-group), but since he is not playing for either the Broncos or the Panthers in this context, he is considered to belong to some other team in the NFL, hence tagged as [OTHER]. The word 'he' is referring to an in-group player from the Broncos, and Horne is tagged as [OTHER], the correct identification of the tagged comment.	1669580550.0	broncos	panthers	DanMarinoTambourineo		1.0	0.04474806785583496	[5, 4]

The win probability is very low, indicating that the Bears are likely performing poorly, in line with the negative comment about the player's performance. Hence, 'Kyler Gordon' should be tagged [IN] to denote that he is part of the in-group.	Kyler Gordon is a member of the Bears, the team which the commenter supports, making him part of the in-group. The statement criticizes Kyler Gordon's performance but criticism of a specific player is typically something a fan directs towards their own team members, rather than the opponent's. Thus, 'Kyler Gordon' should be tagged with [IN].	1662922083.0	bears	49ers	The_Haskins		3.0	0.0699769258499146	[5]

Since fans typically speak this way in defense of their own team, it can be inferred that the comment refers to the in-group (Patriots). Therefore, 'the qb' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group quarterback, and 'receivers' should also be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group receivers. Despite the win probability being relatively low, the context implies frustration with the performance of specific in-group players rather than a critique of the opposing team.	The comment is criticizing both the quarterback for missing open receivers and the receivers for potentially being indicative of missed opportunities. Given that fans typically critique players on their own team more directly without qualifiers, it's reasonable to assume they are talking about the in-group team players. Therefore, 'the qb' and 'receivers' are both referring to in-group players and should be tagged with [IN].	1672603251.0	patriots	dolphins			1.0	0.301660150289536	[4, 4]

Given that the in-group is the Seahawks, 'defense' refers to the Seahawks' defense. The win probability is reasonably high at 66.8%, suggesting the Seahawks are performing well, which aligns with the encouragement directed towards their own defense. Thus, 'defense' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group's defensive players. The phrase 'em' implicitly refers to the opposing team, but since it is not explicitly mentioned, it is not tagged in the output.	The commenter is addressing their own team's defense, urging them to make a play. This shows that the commenter is supporting their own team's defensive unit. Therefore, 'defense' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Seahawks. The phrase 'make 'em pay' does not explicitly mention the out-group but implies aggression towards the opposing team's offense, reinforcing the defensive context related to the in-group.	1670196240.0	seahawks	rams	SeacattleMoohawks	:HawkStar:	9.0	0.6678645610809331	[5]

Despite the high win probability for the in-group Lions, the commenter is focusing on an individual player's performance. The complaint is directed at the player's poor performance, suggesting he should be gone next year, which indicates the commenter is referring to an in-group player that they hope will improve or be replaced. Therefore, 'Igwenuike' should be tagged [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team supported by the commenter.	The commenter is criticizing Igwenuike for his performance, indicating that they believe he should be removed from the team. This kind of critique suggests the commenter is talking about a player from their own team, as fans are more likely to scrutinize and demand changes within their own ranks. Thus, 'Igwenuike' is someone from the in-group (Lions) and should be tagged with [IN].	1639943578.0	lions	cardinals	noah218	Welcome to Detroit!	3.0	0.823655068874359	[5]

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	In this context, the comment "9, actually." doesn't provide explicit details about what it's referencing, but given that the in-group is the Patriots and the commenter is likely focusing on the current state of their team, it implicitly refers to something related to the in-group (like the number of points they need, the number of points they've scored, or any other game-relevant statistic). Since the win probability is low for the Patriots, the comment might be emphasizing something significant about their current performance or need in the game. Therefore, the sentence should be tagged as [IN] even if there are no explicit in-group terms, because the context implies it.	The comment '9, actually.' is a standalone response which likely corrects a previous statement about the in-group team's performance or score. Because this comment implies some specific detail that the commenter, a Patriots supporter, is clarifying or emphasizing about their team, it should be tagged with [IN]. The sentence itself does not contain any specific referring expressions, so the sentence-level tag '[SENT]' is used and should be tagged as [IN].	1633889071.0	patriots	texans	ReonL		1.0	0.373346865177154	[5]

The win probability for the Eagles (the in-group team) is very high at 92.1%, indicating they are likely having a successful game. The comment uses "you" to describe a hypothetical situation where the strong Steelers defense is reduced to something weak (a "Pickett fence"), implying the in-group team's dominance. Therefore, "the Steel Curtain" should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the Steelers, while the rest of the sentence does not contain explicit mentions of either team. The term "Pickett fence" is a play on words involving the name of the Steelers' quarterback Kenny Pickett, further supporting that the referred entity is the out-group's defense.	"the Steel Curtain" is a well-known nickname for the Pittsburgh Steelers' defense, which is the out-group team in this context. The commenter is describing an action that negatively impacts the Steelers' defense, which aligns with a comment from an in-group perspective. Therefore, "the Steel Curtain" should be tagged as [OUT] as it refers to the out-group team the commenter is opposing. The rest of the comment implicitly revolves around this phrase and does not contain other specific references, so the sentence tag is not required for other parts.	1667152969.0	eagles	steelers	ReservoirBaws		5.0	0.9214933142066	[4]

The phrase "Titans gonna Titan" is a casual and somewhat self-deprecating way of saying that the Titans are behaving or performing in a manner typical for them, possibly hinting at an inconsistency or error. This is a sentiment a fan might express about their own team. Therefore, 'Titans' is tagged [IN] as it directly refers to the in-group team, and 'Titan' is also tagged [IN] as it symbolically refers to the same in-group. This explanation aligns with the win probability being moderately high, suggesting that even if the Titans are doing well overall, there may have been a specific moment that prompted this comment.	The comment uses the term 'Titans' which directly refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. The phrase 'Titans gonna Titan' is a common way for fans to express frustration or resignation about a recurring pattern of behavior or performance specific to their team. The use of 'Titans' and 'Titan' here denotes the in-group team, the Titans. Therefore, both 'Titans' and 'Titan' should be tagged with [IN], reflecting that they refer to the team the commenter supports.	1639944567.0	titans	steelers	itzyaboikelz		-1.0	0.667870694594844	[5, 5]

They also mention 'us,' which in this context refers to the Bears, the in-group team the commenter supports. The win probability is quite high for the Bears, indicating a favorable state for the in-group at the time of commenting, but the commenter appears to be referencing a past game where the Vikings got lucky against the Bears. Hence, 'Vikings' should be tagged as [OTHER] and 'us' should be tagged as [IN].	The Vikings are neither the in-group team (Bears) nor the out-group team (Giants), so 'Vikings' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The term 'us' implies the in-group team that the commenter supports, which is the Bears, so 'us' should be tagged as [IN].	1641147834.0	bears	giants	pete247		2.0	0.936305657029152	[5, 5]

The strong language ("Shut the fuck up") indicates frustration or anger typically directed towards the opposing team, especially when the in-group (Patriots) is leading with a high win probability of 87.1%. Therefore, "Chargers" should be tagged as [OUT] because it explicitly refers to the opponent.	The commenter explicitly uses 'Chargers' in a derogatory manner, indicating frustration or anger towards the out-group team. Since 'Chargers' refers directly to the out-group opponent, it should be tagged [OUT]. The negative sentiment toward the Chargers supports the interpretation that the commenter is a Patriots fan expressing hostility towards the opposing team. Therefore, 'Chargers' is correctly tagged with [OUT].	1635720687.0	patriots	chargers	Rocko52		1.0	0.871127605438232	[5]

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is referring to a specific past event involving Blake Bortles, who is a former player for the Jaguars. Given that the commenter is a supporter of the Jaguars, recalling a memorable moment related to a well-known player from their in-group team is a common occurrence among fans. Since the entire sentence refers to an in-group player's performance from a previous game, it implies that the sentiment and focus of the comment are on the in-group. Despite there being no explicit mention of the team name or any pronoun referring to the in-group directly, it is clear from the context that the commenter is talking about the Jaguars. Therefore, the entire sentence is tagged as [IN], and since there is no specific word or phrase to tag, '[SENT]' is used as the tag for referring to the in-group in this context.	The commenter mentions "4th down with Bortles," referring to Blake Bortles, who was a quarterback for the Jaguars. Given the in-group is the Jaguars, the mention of a specific play involving a known player from their team without any derogatory undertone suggests they are reminiscing about an in-group moment. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN] since it's about an in-group event, and '[SENT]' is the appropriate tagged phrase to capture this idea, encapsulating the in-group reference implicitly.	1636316779.0	jaguars	bills	TMNBortles	Tony Boselli :TB71:	2.0	0.368711292743683	[5]

Given that the win probability is relatively high (70.1%) for the in-group (Raiders), the commenter is likely focused on their own team's performance. The phrase "a def td" in itself could refer to either team, but the contextual frustration and surprise likely indicate that the commenter is talking about the in-group, as fans typically express such sentiments about the team they support. Since both sentences lack explicit references to a team but are implicitly focused on the in-group's performance, both '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN] signifying the comment pertains to the in-group team, the Raiders.	The commenter is expressing disbelief and a sense of inevitability about the fact that it's been three years since their team scored a defensive touchdown. This type of reflective comment, where the outcome feels negative and impactful over a long period, is likely about the team they support – the in-group. There are no explicit words or phrases that directly refer to the team, but the sentiment expressed is something a fan would usually reserve for their own team. Thus, both sentences ('[SENT]') are implicitly about the in-group and should be tagged with [IN].	1664746663.0	raiders	broncos	IrateGandhi	:87:	2.0	0.701314032077789	[5, 5]

This kind of comment is typically made by fans about their own team when criticizing or explaining poor performance, especially when the win probability for the in-group is very low, as indicated here (4.2%).The phrases "him" and "his QB" refer to members of the same team, which in this context, given that the commenter supports the Falcons, means they refer to Falcons players. The comment reflects a critique or concern about the performance of the Falcons' offense, with "him" likely being a Falcons player who is struggling due to the quarterback (also a Falcon) not having sufficient time to make plays.Thus, "him" and "his QB" should both be tagged as [IN] because they refer to the in-group (Falcons) players, making the provided target and list of referring expressions correct.	The comment is likely about the in-group (Falcons) because fans often discuss their own players' performance and their difficulties. The phrase 'his QB' suggests the quarterback from the same team as 'him', indicating both are from the in-group. Thus, 'him' and 'his QB' should be tagged with '[IN]' since they refer to members of the in-group with respect to the commenter. The reference to the QB struggling often implies commentary about the Falcon's offensive line giving him insufficient protection, supporting the in-group tagging.	1639954972.0	falcons	49ers	thekittiestitties00		0.0	0.042069911956787	[5, 5]

Given the context, where the Raiders (in-group) have a low win probability, it implies that the critique is directed at their own team. There are no explicit references to either team, but the nature of the critique strongly suggests the commenter is talking about the in-group team. Therefore, both sentences should implicitly be tagged with [IN] since they are expressing frustration and advice towards the Raiders. Thus, '[SENT]' and '[SENT]' are tagged with '[IN]'.	The commenter expresses a desire for the team to start taking more chances and critiques their current style of play as too scared. This is indicative of a fan talking about their own team, as they are suggesting a change in strategy and pointing out flaws in the team's play. Since there are no explicit references to players or teams in either sentence, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] for both sentences, indicating that they implicitly refer to the in-group team, the Raiders.	1638741664.0	raiders	washington	BlueDreamJason	:Logo_95-Present:	1.0	0.34027087688446	[5, 5]

The use of expletives shows a strong emotional reaction towards the opponent team, which further indicates in-group vs. out-group dynamics commonly seen in sports fandom. Given that the in-group team is the Cardinals and the out-group team is the Rams, "the Rams" and "LA" are correctly tagged as [OUT]. The win probability is almost 50%, suggesting the game is closely contested, but the comment's focus remains on disparaging the opponent team.	The comment is expressing strong negativity towards "the Rams" and "LA," which are both directly related to the opponent team for this game, the Rams. "the Rams" specifically refers to the team itself, and "LA" refers to the city from which the Rams originate. Both are part of the out-group with respect to the Cardinals, the in-group team the commenter supports.

Considering Toney was a draft pick for the Giants, he should be tagged [IN] as he is associated with the in-group team the commenter supports. Despite the somewhat low win probability indicating that the Giants are unlikely to win, the comment is still focused on a player from the in-group team. Therefore, 'Toney' should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is referring to Kadarius Toney, who was among the Giants' draft picks, showing a level of interest or concern that would typically come from a supporter. As Toney plays for the Giants, he should be tagged as [IN]. The phrase "Idk how got bold" is unclear but doesn't refer explicitly to an entity in this context, so no other tagging is necessary. Therefore, 'Toney' correctly being tagged as [IN] indicates that the comment is about an in-group player aligned with the commenter's team, the Giants.	1631483406.0	giants	broncos	DirectFXX	:Giants-Logo-Oldschool:	-1.0	0.238346740603447	[5]

This implies the commenter is praising the in-group team's performance. There's no explicit mention of a specific team, but given the context, it's reasonable to infer that the praise is directed towards the in-group team. Thus, the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group, and is tagged as such, with the entire sentence being marked as the referring expression.	The comment "beautiful drive" generally expresses praise, likely directed towards the in-group team if a fan is celebrating a successful drive. As there is no explicit reference to either team, we infer that the commenter is talking about the in-group (Eagles) implicitly, as fans typically praise their own team more passionately. Therefore, the sentence should be tagged [IN], since the praise is implicitly directed at the in-group team.	1667524145.0	eagles	texans	Vlayde		3.0	0.878809094429016	[5]

Hence, 'Tom Brady' should be tagged as [OUT]. The second sentence mentions Nick Saban, followed by a dolphin emoji. Nick Saban is currently the head coach of the University of Alabama, known for his time with the Miami Dolphins (hence the dolphin emoji)—another NFL team that is not playing in this game. Therefore, '🐬' should be tagged as [OTHER], indicating a reference to another team in the NFL. The high win probability of 99.1% suggests the commenter is reflecting and recalling past events rather than expressing immediate concerns, properly tagging 'Tom Brady' as [OUT] and the dolphin emoji as [OTHER].	The comment refers to a historical event involving Tom Brady, who is a player for the out-group (Buccaneers), thus 'Tom Brady' should be tagged [OUT]. The second sentence mentions Nick Saban and uses a dolphin emoji (🐬), referring to the Miami Dolphins, another NFL team that is neither the commenter's in-group (Saints) nor the out-group (Buccaneers), thus the dolphin emoji (🐬) should be tagged [OTHER].

In the first sentence, 'Were' is referring to the Bears (the in-group), noting that they are still in the game despite issues, thus it should be tagged [IN].- 'the defense' also refers to the Bears' defense, which the commenter compliments for its overall performance aside from a few mistakes, and thus should be tagged [IN].- In the second sentence, 'the rams' clearly refers to the out-group team, so it should be tagged [OUT].- The last sentence again uses 'Were' and 'ourselves', both indicating the in-group, expressing a sentiment that the in-group (Bears) is self-sabotaging ('beating ourselves'), thus should be tagged [IN].Overall, each tagged expression correctly reflects whether it pertains to the in-group, out-group, or is an implicit reference to the in-group.	The commenter is a Bears fan, and the comment is about their game against the Rams. Here's a reasonable explanation for why the tags are appropriate:s- The first sentence is recognizing that they are still competitive in the game and attributes it to their own team's defense, despite mentioning two blown coverages. Since the qualifier 'defense' is mentioned positively, it is referring to the in-group team (Bears). 'Were' and 'the defense' refer to the Bears and should be tagged [IN].- The second sentence talks about how the strategy of going for it on fourth down twice and a red zone interception (int) gave the opponent a short field. This places the Rams in the out-group by blaming their own team's actions leading to an advantage for the Rams. 'the rams' clearly refers to the out-group team and should be tagged [OUT].- The third sentence is an introspective comment acknowledging that their own team's mistakes are causing their problems. 'Were' and 'ourselves' obviously refer to the Bears, reflecting a sense of collective self-blame typical in-group identification.Therefore, the entities are tagged as follows:- 'Were' (first sentence) and 'the defense' refer to the Bears ([IN]).- 'the rams'	1631499547.0	bears	rams	Aclrian	Bears	2.0	0.097919881343842	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

The commenter is excited and cheering for Deebo, as indicated by the enthusiastic "LFG" (Let's F***ing Go). Despite the low win probability, the commenter is expressing support and hope for the in-group. Therefore, "DEEBO" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a member of the in-group team.	The commenter is expressing excitement and support using 'LFG' ('Let's Frickin' Go') for 'DEEBO', who refers to Deebo Samuel, a player for the 49ers. Since Deebo Samuel plays for the in-group team (49ers) that the commenter supports, 'DEEBO' should be tagged with [IN] to reflect this association.	1641768851.0	49ers	rams	gdshred95	:jerseyhome19: Deebo Samuel	1.0	0.19741871536407396	[5]

The win probability is low, indicating that the Ravens are not performing well, which aligns with the negative sentiment expressed in the comment. There is no explicit mention of any specific player or unit, but the general criticism suggests that the whole team is being perceived as underperforming. Thus, the entire sentence should be implicitly tagged as [IN].	The lack of a specific subject in the comment suggests the commenter is venting frustration about the in-group team's performance, likely referring to how the Ravens are playing. When fans express disappointment without specifying a team, they are usually referring to their own team. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment implicitly criticizes the in-group team's play.	1673838176.0	ravens	bengals	betterAThalo		7.0	0.263732731342316	[2]

['Browns', 'Njoku']	[(35, 41), (79, 84)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is sharing a positive experience in relation to their support for the in-group team, the Browns, which is suggested by the high win probability. The phrase "one of the coolest Browns experience I've had so far" indicates fondness and is something only a supporter of the Browns would say. Therefore, "Browns" should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "Njoku" refers to David Njoku, a player for the Browns. Positive language such as "is the fucking truth" suggests admiration for a player on the supported team. Thus, "Njoku" should also be tagged as [IN].	The commenter supports the Browns and is reflecting on a positive experience related to the Browns, making 'Browns' an in-group reference. In the second sentence, Njoku, who is a player for the Browns, is being praised, indicating that 'Njoku' is also an in-group reference.

The in-group is the Bears, and there are no explicit references to them in this comment, which aligns with the context of the high win probability (91.9%) for the in-group and the commenter seemingly enjoying a bad play by the opponent. Thus, 'lions' is the only referring expression and should be tagged correctly as [OUT].	The comment mocks a Lions player for holding, which is negative and thus targeted towards the out-group. The term 'lions' clearly refers to the opponent team, the Lions, and thus should be tagged as [OUT].	1668370279.0	bears	lions	Penetraytion	Smokin' Jay	10.0	0.918714433908463	[5]

Given the Buccaneers' relatively low win probability at 37.8%, the commenter might be directing frustration toward the Saints, who are the out-group. Hence, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as [OUT] to capture the implicit reference to the opponent.	The commenter is expressing a negative opinion ('Such trash'), which is more likely directed towards the opponent rather than their own team. As a supporter of the Buccaneers, it is reasonable to infer that this comment is directed at the Saints (the out-group), even though no explicit word/phrase is mentioned that refers directly to the out-group. Thus the entire sentence should be tagged with [OUT] since the complaint is implicitly referencing the out-group team, the Saints.	1639971092.0	buccaneers	saints	PassItToSteven	:brooksjersey: Brooks Jersey	2.0	0.378107249736786	[5]

The comment mentions 'firing the cannons,' which is a tradition associated with the Buccaneers after scoring or making a significant play. Since the comment is mocking 'firing the cannons after a failed 2 pt attempt,' it is likely directed at the opponent, the Buccaneers. Therefore, 'They' refers to the out-group Buccaneers and should be tagged with [OUT].	The comment mocks a team for their decision to fire cannons after a failed 2-point attempt. This kind of sarcastic remark would typically be directed at the opponent rather than one's own team. Since the commenter is a Cowboys fan, "They" in this context likely refers to the Buccaneers, the out-group team. Therefore, "They" should be tagged [OUT].	1673926566.0	cowboys	buccaneers	gdaman22	CeeDee Lamb	14.0	0.9864308283925056	[3]

[IN] So , the coach can come and shove a player ( allowed to stay ) but the player gets ejected ? [SENT] What the fuck . 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is upset about a coaching decision and the resulting ejection of a player, creating the sense that they are lamenting a decision against their supported team (Browns). The question implies dissatisfaction with a decision made by the officials, which is something fans are more likely to express about their own team being unfairly treated. The win probability is moderate, indicating that the game is still competitive. The first sentence does not contain specific words referring to either team, but the sentiment suggests frustration directed towards a perceived injustice against the in-group. As such, it is reasonable to infer that the comment is implicitly about the in-group team. The second sentence, 'What the fuck', enhances the sense of frustration and is very likely directed towards the situation impacting the Browns.Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since there is no explicit word/phrase that refers to the in-group, but the comment is referring to the in-group implicitly.Therefore, the provided TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS are correct, supporting the overall reasoning.The commenter is upset about a decision involving a coach and a player, likely implying a perceived injustice against their team (Browns). The win probability is moderate, suggesting the game is still in progress and competitive	The comment expresses frustration about what the commenter perceives as unfair treatment of a player by the officials. This reaction likely stems from something that happened to a player on the commenter's own team, given the intensity of the frustration. The '[SENT]' tag is used for the first sentence because the entire situation described implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Browns, despite not naming anyone explicitly. The second sentence is an expression of frustration and does not directly refer to any team or entity, so it does not require an entity tag.	1631479792.0	browns	chiefs	_rubaiyat	:brownie-elf:	11.0	0.413454413414001	[5]

Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] to capture the implicit reference.In the second sentence, the word "we" clearly indicates the in-group team, the Cowboys, since fans typically use "we" to represent their own team. Additionally, the context of needing something further emphasizes an in-group perspective. Hence, "we" is tagged [IN].	The commenter is expressing sarcasm or frustration, which implies some kind of negative occurrence that has affected the in-group team. The use of "we" in the second sentence strongly indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group they support. Therefore, the first sentence is also likely about the in-group's situation due to the continuation of the sentiment. As there is no explicit mention of the in-group team in the first sentence, it is tagged as [IN] to indicate that it refers to the in-group implicitly, and "we" is tagged [IN] to highlight its relationship to the in-group.	1632087517.0	cowboys	chargers	smokedspirit	CeeDee Lamb	2.0	0.526518076658249	[5, 5]

The win probability is very high, indicating the in-group (Eagles) is likely doing well, and the comment is reflective rather than critical, underscoring a commonly discussed theme among Eagles fans. Therefore, "We" should be tagged as [IN] as it refers to the in-group team.	'We' is a term that usually indicates the group the commenter identifies with, which in this case is the Eagles. Since the commenter is part of the Eagles' fanbase, 'We' should be tagged with [IN], as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1665976523.0	eagles	cowboys	4Khazmodan		2.0	0.962443400174379	[5]

['he']	[(13, 15)]	['[IN]']	The comment "Maybe he was waving bye to GRoman?" likely references a player from the in-group team, the Ravens, given the context and the win probability of 100%. Such a high win probability suggests the Ravens are either winning decisively or have already secured the victory, which could imply a celebratory or mocking gesture made by a player on the Ravens. Since the commenter supports the Ravens, 'he' is assumed to refer to a Ravens player displaying this gesture, and there are no explicit references to the out-group (Bengals) or another team. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player. GRoman, likely being Greg Roman, a Ravens coach, reinforces the notion that the comment is focused on an in-group context.	The comment seems to be about a Ravens player whose gesture is being interpreted. Since the commenter is a Ravens fan, it's likely they are referring to their own player, as the comment lacks any negative sentiment or clear indication that the player is from the out-group.

['We', 'we']	[(7, 9), (79, 81)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment uses the pronoun "We," which typically signifies the in-group team the commenter supports. Given the low win probability, the commenter is likely expressing frustration or concern over the performance of their supported team, the Colts. In the first sentence, "We" implicitly refers to the Colts leaving points on the field, and in the second sentence, "we" again refers to the Colts needing to figure out how to score. Therefore, both instances of "We" and "we" should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group team, fitting the context of the comment properly.	The use of "We" and "we" without qualification indicates that the commenter is referring to the team they support, which is the Colts. It is unlikely that a fan would talk about the opponent team in this manner, as they are expressing concern and providing constructive criticism that fans typically reserve for their in-group team. Therefore, both occurrences of "We" and "we" should be tagged as referring to the in-group ([IN]). The phrases "This game is not over" and "figure out how to score" continue the discussion about the in-group's performance, implicitly addressing the Colts as well. Hence, the tags and referring expressions are correctly identified.	1632074520.0	colts	rams	Aleph_Alpha_001	Raheem Morris	10.0	0.169599190354347	[5, 5]

The use of 'we' indicates the commenter is talking about the in-group, the Raiders, questioning their strategy or luck with respect to the coin toss. This is supported by the context of the high win probability, which suggests the in-group is doing well overall, but the commenter is focusing on a specific aspect of the game. Therefore, 'we' in both instances should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Raiders.	The use of 'we' indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group team, which in this case is the Raiders. The expression 'do we lose every coin toss or do we just always want the ball first?' reflects a complaint or concern typically expressed by a fan of the team they support, reinforcing that 'we' refers to the in-group.

The use of the celebratory phrase "# El Kittle !" suggests pride or excitement towards Kittle's performance in the game. Given the high win probability, it is likely that Kittle made a significant play, which is prompting this enthusiastic comment. Therefore, 'Kittle' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	'Kittle' refers to George Kittle, who is a player for the 49ers. Since the commenter is a supporter of the 49ers, the reference to Kittle is tagged [IN].

The in-group team, Chiefs, are currently ahead with a win probability of 66.1%, so the commenter is probably pointing out a mistake by the out-group team. Since there is no explicit mention of the Chargers, the sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with [OUT] to signify that the commenter is talking about an event that negatively affects the out-group team, which implicitly benefits the in-group team.	The comment "That's a fumble." is likely referring to a mistake or turnover by the out-group team, the Chargers, as perceived by a Chiefs supporter. Given the comment's context, it's more plausible that the commenter is criticizing the opposing team rather than their own, especially since no specific entity is mentioned. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [OUT], implying that the fumble is attributed to the out-group team. The tag [OUT] for the sentence correctly identifies this contextual implication.	1669002561.0	chiefs	chargers	freedagent		8.0	0.6614640355110171	[2]

Since Allen refers to Josh Allen, who is the quarterback for the Buffalo Bills (the in-group team in this context), it confirms that the commenter is supporting their own team. Despite the high win probability, which suggests the Bills are likely to win, fans often cheer on their own players to maintain momentum and ensure victory. Therefore, 'Allen' should be tagged as [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team.	The commenter is providing encouragement and support to a player named Allen. Given the context of an NFL game and knowing the in-group is the Bills, 'Allen' refers to Josh Allen, who is the quarterback for the Buffalo Bills.

[SENT] Tragic 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The Patriots have a very low win probability, indicating they are likely losing. The comment is critical of the play strategy on second down, describing it as "a great way to burn clock and reduce chances of a first down," implying poor execution or strategy. Despite there being no explicit mention of the team, this level of critique is typically directed towards the in-group team the commenter supports. The second sentence, "Tragic," further emphasizes the disappointment likely directed at the in-group performance. Thus, the first sentence is implicitly about the Patriots and the comment is referring to the in-group, requiring it to be tagged [IN], and as there is no explicit reference, '[SENT]' is tagged.	The comment's tone suggests disappointment, likely indicating it is about the in-group team. The statement evaluates a play as a poor strategy ("great way to burn clock and reduce chances of a first down") and calls it "Tragic", which is a negative sentiment. Commenters are more likely to express disappointment and criticize poor plays regarding their own team, the Patriots in this case. Since there is no explicit mention of the in-group team (Patriots) in the comment, the entire first sentence should be tagged [IN] as it implicitly refers to the in-group. The second sentence "Tragic" continues this sentiment and should reflect as well.

Given that 'ravens' is the in-group and the commenter is interested in watching their game, 'ravens' should be tagged with [IN] to reflect that it refers to the team the commenter supports. The win probability is high, indicating the in-group is likely winning or performing well, which aligns with the commenter's interest in watching the game. Therefore, 'ravens' is appropriately tagged as [IN].	The commenter is asking for a link to watch the Ravens game. This indicates that the commenter is interested in watching their in-group team, the Ravens, play. The term 'ravens' directly refers to the in-group team.

The win probability is relatively high, indicating the Browns are doing reasonably well, which further supports the likelihood of a fan cheering enthusiastically for the in-group. The word "Browns" explicitly refers to the in-group team and should therefore be tagged [IN].	The commenter is explicitly cheering for the in-group team, which is the Browns. The phrase "Let's go Browns!" is a direct expression of support, indicative of the in-group support.

'Stop running the GD ball so much' is a complaint directed at the team's play-calling or strategy, something a fan is more likely to say about their own team rather than the opponent's. The exclamation 'JFC' is also in line with expressing frustration toward the in-group's performance. 'This is boring and does nothing to develop fields' directly speaks to the in-group's strategy and its impact on 'fields,' who is a player for the in-group team (Bears). The overall sentiment of the comment is indicative of dissatisfaction with the in-group's coaching and offensive strategies. Therefore:1. The first sentence '[SENT] Stop running the GD ball so much' is complaining about the in-group team's strategy and is tagged as [IN].2. The second sentence '[SENT] JFC' is an expression of frustration, likely directed at the in-group team, so it is tagged as [IN].3.

'Stop running the GD ball so much' and 'JFC' express frustration, likely directed towards their own team (the Bears). The last sentence mentions 'fields,' which is a reference to Justin Fields, the Bears' quarterback. Therefore, 'Stop running the GD ball so much' and 'JFC' should be tagged [IN] because they are criticisms directed towards the in-group. The sentence 'This is boring and does nothing to develop fields' complains about a strategy that is not beneficial for a player in the in-group, thus 'fields' should also be tagged [IN]. Overall, the comment expresses dissatisfaction with the in-group team's performance and strategy, which explains why the sentences and specific expressions are tagged accordingly.	1668366378.0	bears	lions	mikereno2		-9.0	0.444254040718079	[5, 5, 5]

The win probability is high for the in-group (Vikings), so the commenter likely expects better performance from their team and is critical despite the favorable situation. The phrase "the coaching staff" is being used without qualification, which is common when referring to the commenter's own team's staff. Therefore, "the coaching staff" should be tagged [IN], indicating it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The comment is critical of the coaching staff, which suggests that the commenter is frustrated with the in-group team's performance. Since 'the coaching staff' is mentioned without any qualification and the criticism is general, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is referring to their own team's coaching staff. Thus, 'the coaching staff' should be tagged with [IN].	1633891648.0	vikings	lions	jchunk13	Randall McGodDamnDaniel	5.0	0.898255228996277	[5]

['we', 'Ryan']	[(39, 41), (122, 126)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment is about the Colts' attempt to replicate their prior success, hinting at their struggles in the game against the Titans, evidenced by their low win probability. In the first sentence, 'we' is used, which almost always refers to the in-group as fans typically use 'we' to talk about their own team. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN].In the second sentence, the mention of the pass rush getting home is likely referring to the Titans' defense putting pressure on the Colts' quarterback. Matt Ryan, the Colts' quarterback, is trying to mitigate this by checking down, which implies that 'Ryan' is referring to an in-group player. Therefore, 'Ryan' should be tagged [IN].Thus, the comment correctly tags 'we' and 'Ryan' with [IN] since the commenter is referring to the in-group team, the Colts.	The first sentence talks about replicating the success 'we had last week', where 'we' likely refers to the in-group team (Colts), as fans often use 'we' to refer to their own team. In the second sentence, 'Ryan' is specified by name, and since Matt Ryan is the quarterback for the Colts, he should be tagged as part of the in-group. Therefore, 'we' and 'Ryan' are correctly identified as referring to the in-group, and the sentences are correctly tagged accordingly.	1666553463.0	colts	titans	JR18123		1.0	0.093788862228394	[5, 5]

The term "them" is used to refer to the entity that the commenter is worried will score a touchdown (td). Given the context of the game, where the Dolphins (in-group) are losing with a win probability of 19.9%, it is reasonable to infer that "them" refers to the out-group team, the Vikings. Fans often use pronouns like "them" to refer to opponents during live commentary, especially when expressing concern or frustration about the current play situation. Thus, "them" should be tagged as [OUT] since it is referring to the opposing team, the Vikings.	The word 'them' in the comment refers to the opposing team, the Vikings, as the commenter is expressing apprehension about the out-group team scoring a touchdown before halftime. Fans typically express negative expectations or worry about the performance of the out-group team, especially in a critical situation like scoring before the half. Thus, 'them' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group opponent team the commenter is concerned about.	1665944856.0	dolphins	vikings	Desiss23		1.0	0.198696315288544	[5]

['Harris', 'him']	[(21, 27), (36, 39)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment mentions 'Harris' and 'him' in the context of giving advice or instruction in a team setting, and since the in-group is the Steelers, it's reasonable to assume that these are references to Steelers players, as fans generally discuss their team's players more often. There is no mention of Bengals players, so 'Harris' and 'him' are tagged as [IN]. The win probability is relatively low, indicating the in-group team may be struggling, making it more likely that the commenter is focusing on team dynamics and internal communication, supporting the tagging of both 'Harris' and 'him' as [IN]. The second sentence lacks a clear referent and therefore should be untagged.	Harris is likely Najee Harris, a member of the in-group Steelers. The comment describes Harris telling "him" something, which indicates a communication between teammates. Therefore, "Harris" and "him" are both referring to individuals on the Steelers, making them part of the in-group. The phrase "Pointing up field" does not include explicit references but is likely describing an action within the context of the in-group's play. Thus, tagging these entities as [IN] is appropriate.	1668983963.0	steelers	bengals	bigbruise	:sh::h8::sh: Home Jersey	1.0	0.290670543909073	[5, 5]

Given the context, 'Flacco' should be tagged as [IN] since he is part of the in-group team the commenter supports. Similarly, 'the rook' refers to a rookie player on the same team and should also be tagged as [IN]. Despite the fact that the win probability is at 0.0%, indicating that the Jets have essentially no chance of winning the game, the focus of the comment is on criticism and a request directed at in-group players. Thus, in both instances, the tagged entities are reflective of the in-group team.	The commenter is expressing frustration with Flacco, a player for the in-group Jets team, which suggests that 'Flacco' should be tagged as [IN]. Similarly, in the second sentence, the commenter is supporting a rookie player for the Jets to get a touchdown, indicating that 'the rook' is also a member of the in-group and should be tagged as [IN].

The win probability is quite low, suggesting the situation might be dire for the in-group team, which could be why the commenter is so concerned about Barkley. 'Barkley' should be tagged as [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team (Giants).	The commenter is expressing concern for Saquon Barkley, who is a key player for the New York Giants. Since the commenter supports the Giants, any reference to their player (Barkley) would be considered in-group.

Hence, 'Eagles' should be tagged as [OTHER] to accurately reflect this reference.	The game is between the Steelers and Seahawks, but the commenter mentions 'Eagles,' a team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group.

The phrase "BS PI call" is a complaint about a pass interference (PI) call. In this context, it is ambiguous which team the call was against or for, but given the low probability, the comment could be stemming from frustration against other elements besides the opponent, including officials or other NFL teams. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OTHER]' since the comment may not refer specifically to the in-group or out-group directly but rather the officiating itself.	In this case, the comment "BS PI call" is about a perceived bad call for pass interference (PI) by the officials. Since there is no explicit mention of either the Dolphins (in-group) or the Buccaneers (out-group), and it is not clear which team it is referencing, it is most reasonable to categorize it as relating to some other third-party entity, such as the officials or a critique that is not directed at either specific team. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[OTHER]' to indicate this general critique not targeted at either the in-group or out-group.	1633890111.0	dolphins	buccaneers	strangedaze23	99	3.0	0.044967651367188055	[5]

The comment is disparaging the fan base, which aligns with a common self-critical perspective from a fan of the team. The low win probability further suggests a negative outlook from the fan, reinforcing why they might make such a critical comment. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	In the comment, the word "we" indicates ownership and association with the in-group team, which is the Falcons. The commenter is criticizing the fan base of the Falcons, an action they would not typically do for the out-group team or another team's fan base.

Since this negative language targets the opponent team, the Jaguars, it indicates that "Jags" refers to the out-group. The win probability is 100%, suggesting the in-group (49ers) is performing exceptionally well and the commenter is likely pointing out the shortcomings of the opponent. Thus, "Jags" should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the out-group opponent team, the Jaguars.	The commenter is criticizing the Jaguars by stating that they are undisciplined and have awful coaching. Since the Jaguars are the out-group (the opponent) in this context, 'Jags' should be tagged with [OUT].

Additionally, there is no explicit mention of either team in the comment, but given the tone and context, it implicitly refers to frustrations with the in-group's performance. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN].	The comment is critical of the performance, specifically mentioning failure to get the first down, which indicates frustration typically directed towards the in-group team's performance. Fans usually take ownership of their team's criticism. Since there is no explicit mention of the in-group (Ravens) within the comment, the sentence as a whole is tagged as [IN] to indicate the in-group is being referred to implicitly.	1666921979.0	ravens	buccaneers	sharkh20		2.0	0.18183040618896495	[5]

The presence of a low win probability for the current game doesn't affect the identification because the comment is about a different game. The pronoun 'us' refers to the in-group (Cardinals) implicitly; however, it is not explicitly tagged since the main focus of the provided segment is on identifying the Cowboys, which are correctly tagged as [OTHER].	The game in question is between the Cardinals and the Colts. The 'Cowboys' refers to a team that is neither the in-group (Cardinals) nor the out-group (Colts), making it an 'other' team in the NFL. The word 'us' here refers to the in-group (Cardinals), but there's no need to tag 'us' explicitly since the context of the sentence implies the in-group, and only the Cowboys need to be tagged. Hence, '[OTHER]' correctly tags 'Cowboys' as it is not one of the teams playing the current game.	1640492191.0	cardinals	colts	OldBirdman71		10.0	0.0520428903400898	[5]

The tone suggests frustration or confusion regarding his performance. Given that 'Willis' is mentioned without any additional context, it can be inferred that the commenter is addressing an in-group player rather than an out-group player. The win probability being low suggests that the in-group team might be struggling, adding further context to the commenter's frustration. Therefore, 'WILLIS' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	The comment "WHATCHA DOIN WILLIS" likely refers to a player making a mistake or a questionable decision. Since the commenter is a supporter of the 49ers, it is reasonable to assume that they are addressing a player from their own team.

Hence, 'Harris' should be tagged as [IN] to denote that he is part of the in-group team. There are no other entities mentioned in the sentence, and the commenter is focused on the in-group's struggles, making 'Harris' the only referring expression tagged as [IN].	The sentence "Its disturbing watching Harris getting hit in the backfield" implies concern for a player being hit, which is something that fans typically express about members of the team they support.

The phrase "carrying the whole team" suggests that he is taking on a significant role for his team, which further indicates in-group support. Given the context, both the mention of "Etienne" and "the whole team" refer to the Jaguars, the in-group. Hence, Etienne is tagged as [IN], and "the whole team" is also tagged as [IN], since it implies the entire Jaguars team. The win probability being moderately high suggests that Etienne's performance may be part of why the Jaguars are favored at this point in the game.	The mentioned player, "Etienne," is a running back for the Jaguars, which is the in-group team for the commenter. The expression "the whole team" also refers to the Jaguars.

The lack of any qualification or mention of the out-group suggests that this is a reference to the in-group team, the Browns. The win probability being balanced indicates a tight game, which is why the commenter is focusing on the immediate performance of their team's defense. Therefore, 'defense' is tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter is likely expressing frustration or urging the in-group team to perform better, and since there is no derogatory remark or context that indicates it is referring to the out-group, the reference to 'defense' is probably about the in-group team.

This indicates that they are unhappy with the in-group team's apparent lack of urgency. Hence, "our guys" should be tagged [IN]. The commenter mentions "Watson," who does not play for either the Commanders or Washington (assuming Washington in this context refers to another team the commenter recognizes, e.g., Washington Football Team now the Commanders, but since the in-group is Commanders, the opponent is misconstrued). In this situation, the out-group team referred to as "Washington" assumes a misunderstanding, properly tagging "Watson" as referring to a team like the Browns since that's where Watson actually plays, thus not fitting as in-group or out-group here but under [OTHER].	The commenter is using the phrase "our guys" to refer to the team they support, which in this case is the Commanders. Therefore, "our guys" should be tagged [IN].

Similarly, "the team" also refers to the Bears contextually due to the established reference, and should be tagged as [IN] as well. Therefore, both phrases are correctly tagged with [IN], reflecting the commenter's allegiance to their in-group team.	1669576161.0	bears	jets	Olivia_is_living	Bears	6.0	0.20594717562198595	[5, 5]

The high win probability (80.3%) suggests that the Bengals are performing well, further reinforcing that the fan is likely encouraging their own team to capitalize on their advantage. Since there are no explicit names or other identifying terms, "him" is assumed to be a player from the in-group team, the Bengals. Therefore, "him" should be tagged as [IN].The commenter is likely urging the in-group team, the Bengals, to make a play involving a specific player, who is referred to as "him". Given the high win probability, the commenter is encouraging their team to push ahead even further, making it reasonable to tag "him" as referring to a Bengals player. Thus, "him" is tagged [IN].	The comment "Give it to him cmon" suggests the commenter wants a particular player to receive the ball. Since the commenter is a Bengals fan, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is encouraging the Bengals to give the ball to one of their players. Thus, 'him' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	1664126100.0	bengals	jets	Sim556		1.0	0.803380489349365	[5]

['Allen']	[(35, 40)]	['[IN]']	The comment is expressing concern about a specific player named "Allen." Since the commenter is a supporter of the Chargers, and Allen is a player on the Chargers team (Keenan Allen in this context), it makes sense that "Allen" would be tagged [IN]. The low win probability suggests that the Chargers are not doing well, which aligns with the negative tone of the comment. Therefore, referring to Allen's issues with his hands would be indicative of an issue within the in-group team, the Chargers. Hence, "Allen" should be tagged with [IN] as he refers to an in-group player.	The comment expresses frustration or disappointment about a player named Allen and his performance this year, which is something that fans typically do about members of the team they support. Allen refers to Keenan Allen, who is a prominent wide receiver for the Chargers. Therefore, since the in-group team is the Chargers, 'Allen' should be tagged as [IN], indicating that this comment is about a player from the in-group team.	1633905564.0	chargers	browns	Zammy512		2.0	0.198683798313141	[5]

If we draft Bryce Young? No. Otherwise, yes. He's here only until Nick feels like the team is in position to begin a winning season" comes from a Texan fan during a game against the Dolphins with a win probability of 4.5%, showing that the in-group is likely losing.The first sentence "That ... depends" doesn't clearly reference an entity and provides context for the rest of the comment.The second sentence "If we draft Bryce Young?" includes the word "we," which indicates the in-group (Texans) as fans commonly refer to their team as "we." "Bryce Young," however, is referring to a player not currently on the Texans or Dolphins, hence it should be tagged [OTHER].The third sentence "No. Otherwise, yes" gives a conditional response based on the previous sentence without additional entities mentioned.The fourth sentence "He's here only until Nick feels like the team is in position to begin a winning season" refers to specific individuals and groups within the in-group (Texans). "He" refers to a currently unspecified person (likely a coach or player) from the in-group. "Nick" probably refers to Nick Caserio, the Texans' general manager. "The team"	The comment suggests conditional hypothetical scenarios and involves specific players and team intentions, plus draws from a mix of in-group references and other group references in the NFL:1. "we" refers to the in-group Texans because fans typically use "we" to talk about their own team. It is about the team considering drafting Bryce Young.2. "Bryce Young" is a player who is not currently associated with either the Texans (in-group) or the Dolphins (out-group). As such, Bryce Young is tagged [OTHER].3. "He" refers to a person (probably a current player or coach) related to the Texans' immediate future plans, where "Nick" (likely referring to Nick Caserio, the Texans' General Manager) would decide when the team is ready to start winning. Thus, "He" should be tagged [IN].4. "the team" in "the team is in position to begin a winning season" clearly refers to the in-group (Texans) because it is related to Nick's plan for the team's future progress. Thus, these specific words/phrases have been tagged correctly based on their reference to the in-group, out-group, or other groups in the NFL.	1669574344.0	texans	dolphins	Pugageddon	:doodle16:	1.0	0.04495537281036399	[5, 5, 5, 5]

The win probability for the in-group Bengals is at 0.0%, indicating they have no chance of winning, which might lead the commenter to look forward to a future in-group success rather than the current game's outcome. Therefore, the comment implicitly refers to the Bengals (in-group) despite no explicit mention. '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] because the comment is implicitly about celebrating a future in-group win.	The phrase "Smoke the cigar" likely refers to a celebratory act, which a fan would express for their own team. This suggests that the commenter is anticipating or celebrating a victory for the Bengals, the in-group team. Since the comment lacks explicit references to specific entities, the entire sentence '[SENT]' implicitly refers to the in-group. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	1643584608.0	bengals	chiefs	ethanbduncan		1.0	0.0	[5]

Since the win probability is quite low for the Ravens, it implies that the Ravens (in-group) are struggling, and the commenter is providing advice on what they would like to see from their team. The use of 'they' implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Ravens, as the commenter is talking about what 'they' should do to counter the defense's hard crashing. Hence, 'they' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team.	The commenter proposes a specific play strategy, which implies a focus on improving their own team's performance, typical of a fan's perspective. The term 'they' in the context of potentially exploiting an aggressive defensive play is more likely to refer to the in-group team (Ravens) whose behavior the commenter is closely monitoring and analyzing. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged as [IN], as it implicitly refers to the in-group team.	1639950414.0	ravens	packers	EndsLikeShakespeare	 :ELITE:	2.0	0.271143198013306	[3]

The commenter is likely frustrated and suggesting a change in players. 'sinnet' refers to Reid Sinnett, who is a quarterback for the Dolphins, so the reference should be tagged as [IN]. This comment implicitly acknowledges the game is effectively over, which reflects the current state of the game for the in-group team. Therefore, 'sinnet' should indeed be tagged with [IN].	The commenter is likely a Dolphins fan frustrated with the current game's performance and suggesting to put Sinnet, a player for the Dolphins, into the game.

['Dallas', 'rushers']	[(101, 117)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is likely discussing their frustration with the officiating, expressing that "Dallas' rushers are getting mugged 24/7". Since "Dallas" refers to the Dallas Cowboys, which is the in-group team the commenter supports, the phrase "Dallas' rushers" should be tagged [IN]. The high win probability suggests the in-group team is performing well overall, but the commenter is focusing on a specific issue during the game, which is the perceived unfair treatment of their team's rushers by not calling holding penalties. This frustration is directed towards the circumstances in the game rather than the overall state of play. Thus, "Dallas' rushers" is correctly tagged as [IN], as it refers to players from the in-group team.	The comment expresses frustration about the in-group team players, specifically mentioning 'Dallas' rushers'. Since the commenter supports the Cowboys, 'Dallas' refers to the in-group team. The use of "But holy fuck" indicates a strong emotional reaction, likely due to the unfair treatment of the in-group team players, which further supports this identification. Therefore, 'Dallas' rushers' should be tagged as [IN]. The first sentence is a general preamble about the rules and does not explicitly mention any team, hence it remains untagged.	1667156560.0	cowboys	bears	BigGonzo		1.0	0.847344300717115	[5]

The commenter is likely admonishing the out-group player directly for a perceived mistake or inappropriate action. Given that 'Knox' is a member of the opposing team, the correct tag is [OUT]. The win probability being low suggests that the in-group, the Patriots, are struggling, which can result in fans commenting more on the out-group's actions. Thus 'Knox' should be tagged with [OUT].	'Knox' refers to Dawson Knox, a player for the Buffalo Bills. Since the commenter supports the Patriots and is addressing Knox directly regarding a mistake or illegal action, the reference indicates the out-group (Bills).

The win probability is relatively low, indicating the in-group is not currently winning, which is in line with the desire to close the score gap. There is no explicit mention of any team or player, but the context implies that the commenter is focused on what the in-group needs to do to get closer in score. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN] implicitly, with '[SENT]' being the referring expression.	The commenter is likely referencing a scenario where the in-group team (Bengals) is working to close the point gap, suggesting a desire for betterment or success, indicative of a fan's support. As no specific words or phrases explicitly mention the in-group team, tagging the entire sentence as referring to the in-group implicitly conveys the commenter's focus on the team's effort and the game situation relative to the in-group. Hence, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' and used as the referring expression, encapsulating the in-group reference in the comment.	1671405789.0	bengals	buccaneers	Zac_Anarumo		0.0	0.399076927095652	[5]

Given the low win probability for the Ravens, a one-word comment like "Ohio" can be an exasperated or critical reference to the opponent, since the commenter is likely a Ravens fan who is frustrated. 'Ohio' should thus be tagged [OUT] because it refers to the out-group team's state, and aligns with the context of the Ravens' poor performance.	The comment consists solely of the word 'Ohio'. Since the in-group team is the Ravens, which are based in Baltimore, Maryland, and the out-group team is the Bengals, based in Cincinnati, Ohio, a reference to 'Ohio' would typically be associated with the out-group. However, in this context, the word 'Ohio' is likely used sarcastically or ironically by the Ravens supporter, as a form of shorthand to refer to the out-group's location dismissively, implying something negative about the Bengals. Thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because the comment, although not explicitly positive, is being made from the perspective of the in-group supporter.	1673205037.0	ravens	bengals	razorsharpguitar	 :CAKEBIRD:	1.0	0.02974436618387699	[5]

The term "SLAAAAAAAAAY" refers to Darius Slay, a player for the in-group team (Eagles). The high win probability (96.5%) further supports the idea that the commenter is exalting a successful moment for their team, reinforcing that "SLAAAAAAAAAY" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to a player on the in-group team.	"SLAAAAAAAAAY" is a reference to Darius Slay, who is a player for the Philadelphia Eagles. The exclamatory nature of the comment indicates excitement and support, which aligns with celebrating a player from the in-group team.

[IN] Terrible play calling 	['We', 'we', '[SENT]']	[(7, 9), (24, 26), (93, 99)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenters here are reflecting on their disappointment with their own team's performance, criticizing the repetition of predictable play calls. The phrase "We look just how we did last year" implicitly indicates frustration toward their own team, the Vikings. Hence, both instances of "we" are tagged [IN]. The second sentence "Terrible play calling" criticizes the team's strategy, which also implicitly points to the in-group team, even though it does not explicitly mention the team. The win probability being low means the in-group team is likely not doing well, which aligns with the complaint about play calling. The '[SENT]' token is rightfully tagged [IN], as the comment pertains implicitly to the in-group team, reflecting the fan's dissatisfaction.	The commenter is criticizing their own team's performance, as indicated by the use of 'we' in both sentences. This shows a sense of ownership and belonging, typical of someone discussing the in-group team. So, 'We' and 'we' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group, the Vikings. The second sentence, despite not having an explicit word or phrase referring to the in-group, continues the criticism of their own team's play calling, making the overall sentiment directed at the in-group. Therefore, the [SENT] token in the second sentence should also be tagged with [IN].	1663635663.0	vikings	eagles	Shmooe13		3.0	0.26285341382026695	[5, 5, 5]

This indicates the commenter probably feels their team is being undermined by the opponent, possibly implying a questionable play or interference by the Broncos. Therefore, even though "Sabotage" doesn't explicitly state who is performing the sabotage, it implies that the out-group is at fault. Hence, the sentence should be tagged [OUT].	The word 'Sabotage' is a critical or disparaging term, and given there is no explicit reference to which team/side is being referred to, we should infer based on the context provided by the in-group and out-group teams. As fans typically use negative terms like 'Sabotage' to describe unfavorable actions against the team they support (i.e., the in-group), it is reasonable to assume the commenter is referring to something the out-group (the Broncos) might be doing to hinder the Chiefs. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]' as it implicitly references the out-group opponent in a negative light.	1641685818.0	chiefs	broncos	dcon49	Pat "Kermit" Mahomes	1.0	0.612351596355438	[5]

The commenter is expressing frustration, typically directed towards the team they support. The absence of explicit mentions of players or teams suggests that the in-group team is implied. 'Literally no resistance' and 'Trash' both implicitly criticize the performance of the in-group, the Chargers, so both sentences are tagged with [IN] even though no explicit referring expression is mentioned. The commenter is likely frustrated with the Chargers' poor performance, reflecting the low win probability. Therefore, '[SENT]' for both sentences should be tagged with [IN].	The comments "Literally no resistance" and "Trash" are negative statements, and fans typically make negative comments about their own team's performance when they are frustrated. The lack of explicit references to either the in-group or out-group suggests that these sentences are implicitly criticizing the in-group team. Therefore, both sentences should be tagged with [IN], as the commenter is likely expressing frustration with the Chargers, their in-group team.

The exclamation "THAT'S OUR WIDE RECEIVER ????" suggests a mix of surprise and possibly pride or disbelief about the performance of a specific player, hinting that the commenter is criticizing or highlighting the performance of an in-group player. Since 'OUR' is a possessive pronoun typically used by fans to refer to their own team or players, it should be tagged as [IN]. Therefore, 'OUR' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to an in-group player, making the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS correct.	The use of "OUR" strongly implies that the commenter is referring to the in-group, which in this case is the Patriots. Fans typically use possessive language like "our" to talk about their own team. The incredulity expressed in the phrase "THAT'S OUR WIDE RECEIVER ????" suggests disappointment or disbelief, likely directed towards a player from the in-group.

The exclamation of disappointment ("Dam") suggests frustration over a missed opportunity, which is in line with the low win probability, indicating the in-group is likely losing. Since the comment is criticizing a missed interception opportunity, it implies that the mentioned entity is part of the in-group. Therefore, "X - Men" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an entity within the in-group team that the commenter supports.	"X - Men" is a nickname likely used by the commenter to refer to a member of their in-group team, the Giants, who just missed an interception. Fans typically use such nicknames affectionately for their own players, indicating it is the in-group without explicitly naming them.

This comment speaks to a loss related to the game, which implies the commenter is a supporter of the Broncos and is upset about their loss. As a result, the first sentence should be implicitly tagged with [IN] because the commenter's financial loss is tied to the Broncos' defeat. The remaining sentences express personal consequences and frustration without explicitly referring to any team, so they don't require additional entity tagging beyond the first sentence.	The commenter's first sentence indicates financial loss, which is likely due to a bet on the game. This reaction is consistent with being a fan and supporting the in-group team, especially given the emotional and financial weight tied to the outcome. Thus, the first sentence should be tagged [IN] since, implicitly, they lost the bet supporting the in-group team. The final two sentences express the personal impact without directly referencing any team. So, 'I just lost 1k' should be tagged with [IN], and the remaining two sentences should not have an explicit tag since there's no direct reference to a team in them.	1665114416.0	broncos	colts	ChipmunkOutside443		-2.0	0.0	[5]
train	yujlhm	iw9wj86	t3_yujlhm	[SENT] Rather it be the dog shit first half and tighten down end game defense than giving it all up in the 4th one I 've seen 	[IN] Rather it be the dog shit first half and tighten down end game defense than giving it all up in the 4th one I 've seen 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The comment is expressing a preference for how the in-group team, the 49ers, should play their game, indicating a strategic approach to defense. The phrase "the dog shit first half and tighten down end game defense" appears to reflect on the team's performance strategy without explicitly mentioning the team. The high win probability suggests the commenter is hopeful or content with the current state but still cares about optimizing their strategy. Since the entire comment is implicitly referring to the in-group team's defensive performance and strategy, the '[SENT]' tag should be marked as [IN]. There are no explicit mentions of entities, so the generic tag '[SENT]' captures the implicit reference to the in-group team.	The comment is expressing a criticism of a team's performance pattern and a preference for a better late-game defense compared to giving up in the fourth quarter. This kind of introspective critique and strategic preference is typically made by a fan about their own team. Therefore, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team, the 49ers. Since there is no explicit word/phrase that denotes the in-group, the entire sentence should be tagged [IN]. Thus, the tag '[SENT]' is correctly labeled as [IN] since it refers to an implicit critique and preference about the in-group team's defense strategy.	1668389525.0	49ers	chargers	zzzay4200	:nickbosa: Nick Bosa	2.0	0.630330383777618	[5]

['Cincinnati', 'Browns']	[(20, 30), (97, 103)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	In the first sentence, 'Cincinnati' refers to the Bengals, and since the Bengals are the out-group, one might initially think it should be tagged [OUT]. However, the phrase 'sold Cincinnati to Kentucky' is a derogatory comment, which is something an in-group fan might say about a rival. Given the rest of the context and the common rivalries within states, it makes sense that 'Cincinnati' refers to the out-group Bengals, but it's being mentioned in a context that is more about the in-group rivalry. The second sentence, 'Go Browns!', is clearly a supportive cheer for the in-group team, so 'Browns' properly tagged [IN]. Given the slight misalignment in the first sentence labeling, 'Cincinnati' could be seen as part of the in-group discussion due to the overall tone towards rivalry. Consequently, the sentiment of the text supports the Browns being seen in a context of rivalry, but with proper breakdown "Cincinnati" should have been logically tagged [OUT] and "Browns" as [IN] making the TAG correct but explanation tricky.	The commenter supports the Browns and disparages Cincinnati in the first sentence, which indicates criticism towards the city's football team. Given the context, this suggests Cincinnati is an out-group. However, 'Go Browns!' is a clear expression of support, and since the in-group team is the Browns, it establishes a connection between Cincinnati and the out-group, making 'Cincinnati' a reference aligned with the in-group (Browns). Thus, 'Cincinnati' and 'Browns' are tags aligned with [IN] for clarity in context.	1636306236.0	browns	bengals	ax_and_smash	:browns:	12.0	0.569056928157806	[5, 5]
train	xitesl	ip5au6z	t3_xitesl	[SENT] Cousins needs an interception vaccine 	[SENT] [OUT] needs an interception vaccine 	['Cousins']	[(7, 14)]	['[OUT]']	The comment is referring to Kirk Cousins, the quarterback for the Vikings, who is the out-group opponent team in this context. The high win probability for the in-group Eagles suggests they are doing very well, which could explain why the comment is mocking an out-group player for making mistakes, specifically interceptions. Hence, 'Cousins' should be tagged [OUT] to denote it refers to the opponent team's player.	The comment is expressing frustration or criticism towards Cousins, who is a player for the Vikings, the out-group team. The commenter, being an Eagles fan, is likely deriding the quarterback of the opposing team for throwing too many interceptions. Therefore, 'Cousins' should be tagged with [OUT] as it refers to the out-group player.	1663641110.0	eagles	vikings	Meunderwears		5.0	0.978259682655334	[5]

['this team']	[(58, 67)]	['[IN]']	The comment is discussing issues with the in-group team, the Raiders, as indicated by the phrase "this team." The commenter acknowledges that the defense is not the problem, suggesting that there are other issues within the team, which is common among fans discussing the performance of their own team. The win probability is quite low, indicating the in-group (Raiders) is likely losing, further implying the commenter is focusing on their own team's issues. Therefore, "this team" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Raiders.	The phrase "this team" is used to refer to the in-group team, the Raiders, as the comment is assessing the quality of the team overall and then pointing out where they believe the problem lies. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Raiders, the phrase "this team" should be tagged [IN] as it is discussing the in-group team, and there are no explicit mentions of the out-group or other teams in this comment.	1671407866.0	raiders	patriots	Tarbuckle	:16:	1.0	0.152482450008392	[5]

Given the extremely high win probability for the Rams, it is clear they are doing very well in the current game, so the comment is reminiscing about a time when the Rams were not as successful. However, the comment is mentioning those tough years in a playful, mocking way toward their opponents, the Panthers, who are not performing well in this game. Because of this context, the entire sentence should be tagged [OUT] since the commenter is using the reference to deride the current performance of the out-group, Panthers. The tag is applied to the entire sentence because there's no distinct reference to an in-group or out-group entity; it's the whole sentiment that implies a comparison unfavorable to the Panthers.	The commenter mentions "dark stl years," likely referring to a period when the Rams (the in-group) were based in St. Louis and were performing poorly. The commenter seems to be drawing a parallel between the current situation and those tough times from the past. Given the negative connotation ("dark ... years"), the comment implies dissatisfaction with the team's current performance. Since the Rams are the in-group and the negative sentiment is directed at current circumstances, the sentence likely parallels the poor performance by the out-group (Panthers) as reminding the commenter of the Rams' dark years. Thus, the absence of explicit reference to the in-group and implicit mention of a comparison warrants tagging the entire sentence as [OUT].	1665960437.0	rams	panthers	Curlybrac	LA Rams	3.0	0.995280802249908	[5]

Referees are neutral third parties and not part of either the in-group (Commanders) or out-group (Washington). Since referees and their actions are external to the teams playing, they should be tagged as [OTHER]. The exasperation in the comment suggests dissatisfaction with the refereeing, which is often a sentiment expressed toward an impartial party rather than a team.	The term "reffing" refers to the referees or officiating crew, which is neither part of the in-group (Commanders) nor the out-group (Washington), but rather an independent entity responsible for overseeing the game fairly. Since the referees are independent and not specific to any single team in the NFL, "reffing" should be tagged as [OTHER], indicating that this entity is not associated with any particular team in the context of the comment.	1639334833.0	commanders	washington	snestalgia64	:WAS:	1.0	0.0444524554097218	[5]

They are neither part of the in-group (Browns) nor the out-group (Bengals), nor any other team in the game. Therefore, "Refs" should be tagged as [OTHER] because they are an entity outside of the teams involved in the current game. The comment seems to be making a general observation or complaint about the officiating, which is common in sports commentary. Thus, the tag [OTHER] for 'Refs' is appropriate.	The comment complains about the referees, suggesting that they are making a high number of holding calls. This frustration does not directly address either the in-group (Browns) or the out-group (Bengals). Instead, it focuses on the role of an external entity, the referees, who are neutral and not part of either team. Thus, 'Refs' should be tagged with [OTHER] since they are neither part of the in-group nor out-group, but rather an external factor in the game.	1670785204.0	browns	bengals	Ayresx		1.0	0.309428453445435	[5]

['ridder']	[(11, 17)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is referring to 'ridder', who is a player for the in-group team (Falcons). The term 'ridder haters' implies that the commenter is addressing people who are critical of Ridder, likely within the context of the Falcons' community or fans. The context of the comment suggests a defensive or supportive stance towards Ridder, indicating that the commenter is a supporter of the in-group team. Therefore, 'ridder' should be tagged as [IN]. The rest of the sentence does not contain any explicit references to particular entities that need tagging.	The commenter is addressing people who dislike Ridder, a player for the Falcons (in-group). The phrase 'ridder haters' implies that Ridder belongs to the team the commenter supports, and it is directed at those who doubt or dislike him. Thus, 'ridder' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player, making 'ridder haters' implicitly a phrase referring to the in-group. Therefore, the phrase 'ridder haters' should be interpreted as including an implicit reference to the in-group, justifying the target annotation.	1673207059.0	falcons	buccaneers	csandrew98		3.0	0.56914234161377	[5]

['Robinson', 'him', 'he', 'the chiefs']	[(7, 15), (64, 67), (76, 78), (105, 115)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]', '[OTHER]']	The comment is referring to a player named 'Robinson' who is a great WR3, and mentioning why people didn't notice his talent earlier. The win probability is high at 96.9%, which means the in-group (Ravens) is doing well. Robinson should be tagged as [IN] because the commenter is likely praising a member of their own team, given that they are happy with the player's performance. The comment states people slept on 'him' and 'he' wasn't noticed because he wasn't a major factor in another team, which implies that Robinson is now playing for the in-group (Ravens). Therefore, 'him' and 'he' should be tagged as [IN] as well. 'The chiefs' should be tagged as [OTHER] since the Chiefs are not the out-group (Dolphins) and not the in-group (Ravens), but rather another team entirely. Thus, the tagged output and referring expressions are correct because they accurately categorize the entities as in-group (Ravens), out-group (Dolphins), and other (Chiefs) based on the comment provided.	The commenter is likely referring to Demarcus Robinson, who is a wide receiver (WR3) for the in-group team, the Ravens. So 'Robinson' should be tagged [IN]. The pronouns 'him' and 'he' in the second sentence refer back to 'Robinson', thus they should also be tagged [IN]. 'The chiefs' refers to another NFL team that is not the opponent, thus it should be tagged [OTHER]. The mention of 'I think people slept on him because he wasn't a major factor in the chiefs stacked WR corps' explains why people underestimated Robinson, who used to play for the Chiefs, a team that is not the opponent but another team in the NFL.	1663526411.0	ravens	dolphins			2.0	0.969357458874583	[5, 5, 5, 5]

[SENT] Wins make it easier to forget . 	['Hurts']	[(7, 12)]	['[IN]']	Hurts is a player for the Eagles, who are the in-group team for the commenter. The comment is about Hurts' ability to change the game, suggesting he's receiving criticism or "heat" but has a chance to mitigate it. The low win probability suggests the Eagles are currently struggling, which is why there's a focus on a key player making a difference. The phrase "Wins make it easier to forget" refers generally to team performance turning things around and making current negative situations less significant, but it does not explicitly mention a team or player. Hence, "Hurts" is tagged with [IN] as it refers to a player on the in-group. The rest of the sentences in that context properly convey the general sentiment without explicitly referring to specific entities like teams or players beyond Hurts.	The comment is discussing how a particular player, Hurts, can take actions to alleviate pressure and criticism, which indicates a focus on the in-group since the commenter is an Eagles fan. Jalen Hurts is a quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles. Given this context, 'Hurts' should be tagged as [IN] because he is a player for the in-group team. The second sentence does not explicitly mention any entity, but it implies that winning games, which is relevant to the in-group perspective, helps diminish negative attention or criticism.	1638131969.0	eagles	giants	Dougary96	Greg Ward is bettter than Jerry Rice	8.0	0.24360626935958896	[5]

The comment expresses a personal investment in the outcome of the game ("I put $20 on us winning"), indicating a sense of affiliation and support for the in-group team. The low win probability suggests the Cardinals are unlikely to win, but the commenter appears hopeful or humorous about the situation. Therefore, 'us' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Cardinals.	The word 'us' here is used by the commenter to refer to the team they support, which in this case is the Cardinals. Fans typically use 'us' to refer to their own team, conveying a sense of unity and personal investment in the team's performance. Therefore, 'us' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group. The rest of the comment doesn't mention specific entities from either the out-group or another group, so no further tagging is needed.	1663542347.0	cardinals	raiders	beefydubblez		7.0	0.07721811532974199	[5]

The win probability for the in-group is relatively high, indicating that the Browns are likely doing well at this point in the game. The comment is praising Landry's athletic ability ("with those hops"), which is something a supporter of the in-group team is likely to do. Therefore, "Landry" should be tagged as [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team.	'Landry' likely refers to Jarvis Landry, a well-known wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Browns, mentioning Landry's athletic ability ('hops') in a positive light, it indicates that the reference is to an in-group player. Therefore, 'Landry' should be tagged as [IN].	1631486762.0	browns	chiefs	jtaylor9449	:browns:	1.0	0.630023717880249	[5]

In this context, "they" and "were" both refer to the Vikings, the in-group team supported by the commenter. The use of "panicked" suggests that the commenter is criticizing their own team for making poor decisions under pressure, which aligns with the relatively low win probability of 22.3%. Therefore, "they" and "were" should both be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group team making errors.	The commenter is expressing frustration about their team's performance, specifically mentioning that "they panicked" and are "really fucked". Given the tone and context, it's clear that "they" refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, which is the Vikings. Similarly, "were" in "were really fucked" also refers to the Vikings. Fans typically use "they" and "were" in negative contexts to describe their own team's shortcomings. Therefore, "they" and "were" should both be tagged as [IN], which corresponds to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1671302246.0	vikings	colts	Brokehomiejohn	23	2.0	0.223206236958504	[3, 5]

The commenter is likely noting that the fans or supporters of their team (the Vikings) are quiet today, implying disappointment or a lack of defense for poor performance, which is consistent with the low win probability (25.1%). Therefore, "apologists" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to supporters of the in-group team.	The term 'apologists' typically refers to a subset of a group's fanbase or supporters who defend the team despite poor performance or controversy. It is unlikely that the commenter would be concerned with or even recognize the apologists for the out-group team (Colts) if they are a Vikings fan. Therefore, 'apologists' likely refers to those within the Vikings community who would defend the team, suggesting that this term should be tagged [IN].	1671301888.0	vikings	colts	TrixoftheTrade		2.0	0.250696361064911	[5]

[SENT] FLY [IN] FLY 	['49ers', 'yal', 'CHICKENS']	[(7, 12), (29, 32), (51, 59)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter mentions "49ers," which is neither the in-group (Eagles) nor the out-group (Chiefs), making it an "other" team in the NFL. "yal" refers to the Eagles (in-group), indicating that the commenter is comparing the 49ers to their own team. Despite the commenter seemingly criticizing their own team, the use of "FLY CHICKENS FLY" is a play on the Eagles' chant "Fly Eagles Fly," sarcastically referring to the in-group team, even if in a mocking tone. This sarcastic encouragement, paired with the context of the Eagles having a win probability of 0.0%, signifies a frustration at their poor performance but still focuses on the in-group. Hence, the tags are correct.	The comment is comparing teams and mocking the in-group (Eagles). The 49ers are a team other than the Eagles or Chiefs, so '49ers' should be tagged [OTHER]. The term 'yal' clearly refers to the in-group (Eagles) and should be tagged [IN]. The phrase 'FLY CHICKENS FLY' refers sarcastically to the Eagles, often called the "Birds" or "Eagles," and should be tagged [IN] despite the mocking tone.	1676258098.0	eagles	chiefs	Traditional_Ratio_20		-9.0	0.0	[5, 5, 5]

Jaelan Philips is a player for the Dolphins, which aligns with the commenter's in-group. The phrase "mad lad" in this context is a colloquial term used to praise someone for their performance or actions, suggesting the commenter's positive sentiment toward Jaelan Philips.

[SENT] [IN] gets up big and then just stops playing . [SENT] I do n't like it 	['Offense']	[(41, 48)]	['[IN]']	The comment is expressing a concern about a recurring issue where the offense performs well initially but then fails to maintain that performance. This continuous trend is something a fan would be more likely to notice and care about in their own team rather than the opponent. Given the high win probability of 89.2%, the Eagles (in-group) are likely doing well overall in the game, but the commenter is still critical of their offense's performance pattern, indicating a focus on their own team's shortcomings. Hence, 'Offense' refers to the in-group team (Eagles). The sentences 'This is becoming a trend.' and 'I don't like it' convey dissatisfaction with the overall situation described in the second sentence, which strengthens the idea that the comment is about the in-group rather than the opponent.Thus, 'Offense' should be tagged [IN] since the complaint is about the in-group's offensive performance. The other sentences provide context and overall commentary, grounding the complaint within the scope of the in-group's performance.	The commenter is expressing criticism about a recurring pattern with the offense. Since there is no mention of an opposing team's offense, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is referring to their own team's offense. Fans typically criticize their own team for disappointing performance trends. Therefore, 'Offense' in the second sentence should be tagged as [IN], reflecting the in-group team (Eagles) that the commenter supports. The other sentences do not explicitly mention any team but discuss a pattern related to the in-group.	1665973773.0	eagles	cowboys	ClearSights		14.0	0.892395563423634	[5]

Given that "Davis" is in this context without additional specification of the team he plays for, it is reasonable to infer that "Davis" refers to a player on the in-group team, the Cowboys. There is no mention of the out-group (49ers) or any other team, which further supports that "Davis" must be from the in-group team. The win probability implies a closely contested game where the fan believes involving "Davis" could improve their team's chances, aligning with typical fan behavior of suggesting tactical alterations for their own team rather than an opponent.Therefore, "Davis" should be tagged as [IN], referring to a Cowboys player, making the referring expression 'Davis' with the target being correctly tagged as [IN].	The commenter is likely referring to a player from their supported team (in-group) when suggesting to "get Davis some reps in the backfield." This implies they believe Davis is on the Cowboys and that he should be given more playing time. Thus, 'Davis' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player, the Cowboys, and there are no references to any other teams in the comment.	1674437628.0	cowboys	49ers	Zeerid_Korr	Tony Romo	4.0	0.444929361343384	[3]

[SENT] [IN] is a liability to [IN] 	['Daboll', 'this team']	[(140, 146), (165, 174)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is criticizing people who blame Josh, likely referring to Josh Allen, the quarterback for the Bills (in-group). The high win probability suggests the Bills are doing well overall, which fits with defending a key player like Allen. 'Daboll' refers to Brian Daboll, the Bills' offensive coordinator, making 'Daboll' an in-group entity being criticized. 'this team' refers to the Bills, hence it is also tagged as [IN]. The sentences themselves and the entities described should be tagged in accordance with their association to the in-group.	The commenter appears to be defending Josh, who is likely Josh Allen, the quarterback for the Bills, the in-group team. The negative comment about Daboll, who is Brian Daboll, the offensive coordinator for the Bills, indicates that the commenter is unhappy with the in-group's coaching. 'Daboll' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a part of the in-group team, and 'this team' should also be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team as well. The other sentences reference individuals without tagging needed for the context provided.	1635705381.0	bills	dolphins	Acrylic_	:hamlin:	6.0	0.777003645896912	[5, 5]

['Bengals', 'Ben']	[(37, 44), (171, 174)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	The comment involves mentioning both the opponent team and a player from the in-group team. The commenter describes a defensive strategy executed by the Bengals, indicating 'Bengals' should be tagged as [OUT] because it clearly refers to the opposing team. The phrase 'Ben' refers to Ben Roethlisberger, a known player for the Steelers, which is the in-group team. Therefore, 'Ben' should be tagged as [IN]. Overall, in the context of a very low win probability, the second sentence demonstrates frustration or motivation directed towards their own player, affirming 'Ben' as part of the in-group.	In the first sentence, 'Bengals' explicitly refers to the opponent team, thus it should be tagged [OUT]. In the second sentence, 'Ben' refers to Ben Roethlisberger, the quarterback for the Steelers, thus it should be tagged [IN]. 'They' in the first sentence is a neutral pronoun that is not clearly about either team and does not require an explicit tag here. Therefore, 'Bengals' is tagged [OUT] and 'Ben' is tagged [IN] with each sentence being implicitly about in-group and out-group respectively.	1632686433.0	steelers	bengals	brinkofhumor	:sc::c9::c0::sc: TJ Watt	1.0	0.0024522766470909	[5, 3]

The win probability is around 50%, so the game could be closely contested, causing emotional reactions to immediate plays. Since there is no explicit mention of either team, the frustration is likely directed towards the in-group (49ers) performance. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as referring to the in-group ([IN]).	The comment expresses frustration with a situation in the game, a sentiment likely directed towards the performance of the in-group team the commenter supports. Since no specific entity is mentioned, the sentence itself is tagged as [IN] to indicate that the frustration is related to the in-group team, the 49ers. Thus, the entire sentence should be tagged with [IN] since the complaint is implicitly referencing the in-group's performance.	1632713363.0	49ers	packers	LandryQT	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	1.0	0.49410492181778	[5]

"Warner" is a player for the 49ers (out-group) and the commenter is blaming him for the infraction on "Kupp", who is a Rams player (in-group). The mention of "the oline" (offensive line) getting a push is also from the perspective of the Rams fan commenting positively about their team's performance. Therefore, "PI" is tagged [IN] because it reflects a call the in-group team wanted, "Warner" is tagged [OUT] as he is a 49ers player, "Kupp" is tagged [IN] since he is a Rams player, and "the oline" is tagged [IN] referring to the Rams' offensive line.	The comment critique's a player's actions, praises another's and mentions a particular play. Here's an explanation for the taggings:s- "Should have been PI": Pass interference (PI) is usually called when a defender unfairly hinders a receiver. The commenter supports the Rams and is likely expressing frustration that a defensive player (from the 49ers) committed pass interference without being penalized. This frustration is commonly directed at the opposing team. Therefore, 'PI' is tagged as [IN] since the comment implies the Rams should have benefited from the call. - "Warner was tackling Kupp before the ball even got there.": Warner is a player for the 49ers, and Kupp is a player for the Rams. The act described is defensive pass interference, indicating Warner (out-group) interfered with Kupp (in-group). Thus, 'Warner' is tagged [OUT] and 'Kupp' is tagged [IN]. - "Love the push the oline is getting right now.": The offensive line (oline) helping the commenter's supported team (Rams) implies that the oline mentioned belongs to the in-group. Hence, 'the oline' is tagged [IN].The combined context and actions described lead to	1664845929.0	rams	49ers	WellDonePies		9.0	0.41230931878089905	[4, 5, 5, 5]

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The comment expresses frustration about a missed holding penalty, which is likely in reference to the in-group (Bills). Given the win probability is very high for the in-group, the commenter is probably seeing minor mistakes by officials that could affect their team even in a dominant position. This level of concern about officiating is typical of fans wanting everything to be perfect for their team to ensure victory. Without an explicit mention of the in-group or out-group, the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group because the commenter is focused on an issue that would concern their supported team. Thus, the entire sentence should be tagged [IN].	The comment is expressing frustration about a missed holding penalty, likely implying it was an error that negatively impacted the in-group team (Bills). Such frustration indicates the commenter is upset about a missed call against the opponent (Chiefs), thus '[SENT]' implicitly refers to the in-group.	1665958882.0	bills	chiefs	bogboom	:17-shorts:	2.0	0.991523027420044	[4]

The high win probability indicates that the in-group is performing well, and the positive description of Mike Hughes as 'a curse to be reckoned with' suggests the commenter is praising their own player. Therefore, 'Mike Hughes' should be tagged as [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team.	Mike Hughes plays for the Chiefs, which is the in-group team that the commenter supports. When the commenter calls Mike Hughes "a curse to be reckoned with," it's a positive remark about a player on their own team.

[SENT] Everyone else was garbage 	['this defense', 'they', 'Titans']	[(24, 36), (110, 114), (129, 135)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[OTHER]']	The commenter is scrutinizing the quality of the in-group team's (Patriots) performance during their 7-game winning streak, which is evident from the phrase 'this defense'. Despite the win probability being low, the focus is on critiquing the in-group's past performance rather than the ongoing game. Hence, 'this defense' and 'they' refer to the in-group, the Patriots, and should be tagged as [IN]. When the commenter mentions 'Titans', they are referring to another team in the NFL that is not the opponent (Bills) in the current game, so it should be tagged as [OTHER].	The commenter is discussing the perceived strength of the in-group's defense during a winning streak, implying they are a supporter of the Patriots, who are being disparaged now. Therefore, "this defense" in the first sentence refers to the in-group and should be tagged with [IN]. The word "they" in the second sentence also refers to the in-group, thus it is tagged with [IN]. The commenter then mentions potential contenders within that schedule, with "Titans" being cited, representing another NFL team that is not in-group (Patriots) or the out-group (Bills), so it should be tagged with [OTHER]. The rest of the comment critiques the quality of the teams beaten during the winning streak, indicating skepticism about the in-group's achievements.	1640548678.0	patriots	bills	LastofaBreed		2.0	0.130024254322052	[5, 5, 5]

['Pats', 'our D']	[(7, 11), (106, 111)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	The first sentence is clearly about the Patriots, praised for their strategic play-disguising, thereby warranting the [OUT] tag as they are the out-group team. Despite the relatively high win probability for the Bills, the comment is reacting to a specific moment favoring the opponent. The second sentence expresses hope for the in-group team's defense to counter the out-group's strategies. "Our D" refers directly to the defense of the in-group team, the Bills, hence it is tagged as [IN]. Thus, 'Pats' in the first sentence and 'our D' in the second sentence should be tagged as [OUT] and [IN] respectively.	The first sentence compliments the Patriots on their strategy, indicating that 'Pats' refers to the out-group, hence it should be tagged with [OUT]. The second sentence expresses a hope that their own team's defense will respond, with 'our D' explicitly referring to the in-group (Bills).

The phrase 'our running game' suggests that the commenter is talking about the in-group team's (Buccaneers) running game, which is generating 5 yards per carry. Therefore, 'our running game' should be tagged [IN]. The term 'the pats' refers to the Patriots, the opponent team, and should be tagged [OUT]. The high win probability indicates that the in-group is performing well, which aligns with the positive mention of their running game. The negative EPA per carry for 'the pats' is a critique of the out-group, supporting the [OUT] tag.	The commenter's use of "our running game" strongly indicates they are talking about the performance of their own team, the Buccaneers, which marks this as an in-group reference ([IN]). On the other hand, "the pats" is a common abbreviation for the Patriots, the out-group opponent team, and therefore this phrase should be tagged as referring to the out-group ([OUT]). Hence, the entities are correctly tagged as follows: "our running game" with [IN] and "the pats" with [OUT].	1633315449.0	buccaneers	patriots	easnxc		1.0	0.809363827109337	[5, 5]

Despite the low win probability for the Bears, this comment is praising Graham's performance, indicating it is about the in-group player. Therefore, 'Graham' is tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	Since the commenter supports the Bears, and is expressing a positive opinion about 'Graham', it is reasonable to assume that 'Graham' is a Bears player. Fans typically praise players from the team they support. Therefore, 'Graham' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group entity with respect to the commenter.	1640055528.0	bears	vikings	GraduateOnMyCylinder		3.0	0.136434674263001	[5]

[SENT] Thats just more yds for [IN] to gain before a touchdown , right guys ? [SENT] Um ...guys ? 	['our offense']	[(31, 42)]	['[IN]']	The phrase 'our offense' clearly denotes the in-group in this context, as the commenter uses 'our,' indicating their support for the Steelers. They are attempting to see the positive side of a presumably negative situation, suggesting the Steelers have more yards to gain, which is something only a supporter of the Steelers would say. The win probability indicates a relatively even game but slightly favors the Steelers, which could explain the hopeful tone. The rest of the comment does not explicitly mention any other team or group, so only 'our offense' is tagged, and the rest of the sentences are interpreted as implicitly related to the in-group. This makes 'our offense' correctly tagged with [IN], while other parts of the sentences do not require specific tags.	The comment is indicative of a fan talking positively about their own team's potential offensive gain. The use of 'our offense' directly signals the in-group since 'our' indicates the commenter is talking about their team (the Steelers in this case). Therefore, this phrase should be tagged [IN].The rhetorical questioning of 'right guys? Um...guys?' does not explicitly reference a team or player, so it does not need tagging. It's a way to seek agreement or camaraderie among fellow fans, further indicating the in-group context. Thus, 'our offense' should be tagged [IN] because it clearly refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	1668369825.0	steelers	saints	buffalotrace	:sh::h2::h6::sh:Woodson	8.0	0.55836609005928	[5]

[SENT] A QB change is gonna be necessary sooner rather than later :) 	['Keenum']	[(64, 70)]	['[IN]']	The comment is about the Buffalo Bills, as indicated by the reference to coach McDermott and the suggestion to warm up a backup quarterback (Keenum). Despite the high win probability, which suggests the Bills are doing well, the commenter expresses concern about the current quarterback and advocates for a change.  'McDermott' refers to the head coach of the Bills, and 'Keenum' refers to Case Keenum, who is a backup quarterback for the Bills. These references indicate the comment is focused on the in-group team. The suggestion to warm up Keenum and make a QB change implicitly criticizes the current starting quarterback (likely Josh Allen for the Bills) while still focusing on the in-group team's strategy and personnel.Thus, 'Keenum' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. The second sentence is also implicitly about the in-group, but without explicit mention of players or teams, hence '[SENT]' is not tagged here. The focus remains on the in-group dynamics and decisions.	The comment is about the Bills and their performance. Coach McDermott is the Bills' coach, and Case Keenum is a player for the Bills as well. Therefore, this comment is about making a strategy change for the in-group team. The mention of "Keenum" suggests warming up a player from the in-group, indicating that changes should be made to the Bills' lineup. Hence, "Keenum" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team the commenter supports.	1665339089.0	bills	steelers	russianturnipofdoom		5.0	0.985941959545016	[5]

REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['his', 'we']The comment seems to discuss issues internally related to the in-group team, the Ravens. The phrase "his confidence is so low" likely refers to a Ravens player, given the context of discussing issues that require "some fresh eyes". 'his' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to someone from the in-group (Ravens) who has low confidence. The word 'we' typically indicates the commenter's in-group as it is usually used	The second sentence discusses a player's confidence, which is aligned with the in-group team, the Ravens, as the commenter is expressing concern and offering a potential solution ('better with some fresh eyes'). 'his' in "his confidence is so low" likely refers to a player on the Ravens, indicating in-group. The use of 'we' in "I agree we certainly could do better" implies the commenter's association with the Ravens, thus referring to the in-group.

The phrase "our defense" refers to the defense of the in-group team since "we" and "our" indicate possession or association with the in-group, the Colts in this case. The mid-range win probability suggests the game is relatively close, so fans might be hoping for moments that can shift the outcome in their favor, such as a big turnover. Therefore, "our defense" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The use of "we" in the comment strongly indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group team they support, which is the Colts. The phrase "our defense" also aligns with this sentiment, indicating ownership and support for the in-group team.

'Tomlin' refers to Mike Tomlin, the head coach of the Steelers. Commenters often call for the firing of their own team's coach when performance is poor. Therefore, 'Tomlin' should be tagged [IN] since he is associated with the in-group (Steelers).	The commenter is likely referring to their own team's coach, Mike Tomlin, since they are expressing dissatisfaction with him.

Given that the Jaguars are the in-group, the commenter is likely making a derisive comment about the Titans' performance. The mention of "Titans" directly refers to the opponent team, making it an out-group reference. Since the sentence as a whole centers around the Titans and their expected poor performance, there are no implicit references to the in-group (Jaguars) directly needing points or trying to gain momentum, hence no need for an [IN] tag.Moreover, the win probability for the in-group (Jaguars) is relatively low, suggesting the comment comes from a position of frustration or resignation, which fits with the sarcastic tone of expecting a blowout win against the Titans.Thus, 'the Titans' should be tagged as [OUT] for the out-group, and there's no need for any other tags within this comment under the provided context.	The comment sarcastically congratulates a team for easily winning against the Titans, perceived as weak. This reflects negatively on the Titans, the out-group in this scenario. The word 'Titans' should be tagged [OUT] because it directly refers to the opponent team of the in-group commenter. The complaint about the Titans being an easy target for a wildcard victory confirms the out-group tagging.	1673149937.0	jaguars	titans	SharkMovies	Spooky Jag	2.0	0.287532925605774	[5]

However, the comment is critical and suggests the commenter is unhappy with the in-group's performance. "Mlf" likely refers to Matt LaFleur, the head coach of the Packers, thus it should be tagged as [IN]. Similarly, "your offense" is directed at the Packers, indicating frustration with how the in-group's offense is being managed. Therefore, "your offense" should also be tagged [IN]. Overall, the sentences are implicitly criticizing the in-group, the Packers, hence the respective tags.	The commenter is likely criticizing the coaching tactics and offensive strategy of the in-group team, the Packers, as fans typically direct such comments at their own team. 'Mlf' likely refers to Matt LaFleur, the head coach of the Packers, indicating a critique of his management. The phrase 'your offense' further suggests that the commenter is talking about the Packers' offense.

The phrase 'you' is a direct address to Aaron Rodgers, implicating him further in the play described. The 'tightly covered rookie' is a player from the same team who was targeted by the throw. Given the win probability is relatively high for the in-group, the frustration expressed by the commenter likely stems from a specific instance in the game rather than the overall performance of the team. Therefore, 'Aaron', 'you', and 'a tightly covered rookie' should all be tagged [IN] as they refer to players within the in-group team the commenter supports.	The comment criticizes Aaron Rodgers, the quarterback for the Packers. This indicates that the commenter supports the Packers and is addressing Rodgers directly. Therefore, 'Aaron' and 'you' refer to the in-group and should be tagged [IN]. Additionally, the phrase 'a tightly covered rookie' refers to another Packers player; hence, it should also be tagged [IN].

[SENT] 6 TD by [OUT] will never happen in his lifetime ever again . 	['the defense', 'tua']	[(32, 43), (61, 64)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	The commenter is lamenting a 'historic blown game by the defense,' and since the in-group is the Ravens, they are referring to their own team's defense performing poorly. This is consistent with the win probability being at 0.0%, indicating a loss for the Ravens. Thus, 'the defense' should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, '6 TD by tua' references Tua Tagovailoa, who is a quarterback for the Dolphins, the out-group team. Therefore, 'tua' should be tagged [OUT]. The overall context shows frustration with the in-group's performance and an acknowledgment of an extraordinary performance by an out-group player, which matches the target tags accurately.	The comment criticizes the defense and mentions a notable performance from a player. Given the context, the phrase "A historic blown game by the defense" is likely referring to the in-group team's defense, as fans typically complain about their own team's mistakes. So, "the defense" is tagged as [IN]. The second sentence refers to Tua Tagovailoa, who is a quarterback for the Dolphins, the out-group team. So, "tua" is tagged as [OUT].	1663532683.0	ravens	dolphins	Skirt-Future		6.0	0.0	[5, 5]

Therefore, "Jags" should be tagged as [OTHER], indicating it refers to another team in the NFL, not the in-group (Jets) or the out-group (Patriots). The mention is likely unrelated to the current game being discussed, which is evident from the extremely low win probability for the Jets, suggesting the commenter might be thinking about other teams outside the current matchup.	The game is between the Jets (in-group) and the Patriots (out-group), while 'Jags' refers to the Jacksonville Jaguars, a team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group. Therefore, 'Jags' should be tagged [OTHER] as it refers to another team in the NFL that is not involved in this particular game.	1632080264.0	jets	patriots			10.0	0.0017824806272983	[5]

Given that the win probability for the Broncos (the in-group) is relatively low in this context, it makes sense that a fan is dissatisfied with the current state of play. "The defense" refers to the defense of the in-group, the Broncos, suggesting they might be more effective than the current offense. Thus, "the defense" should be tagged with [IN]. The rest of the sentence structure supports this perspective as well, asserting an in-group context without explicitly stating the team name.The comment expresses frustration with the in-group's offensive performance and humorously suggests letting the defense play offense, highlighting a belief that they might perform better. "The defense" in this context refers to the in-group's defensive unit, which is the Broncos, making it reasonable to tag "the defense" as [IN].	The commenter likely supports the Broncos, as indicated by the context and their frustration. When they suggest letting the defense play offense, they imply that the defense of the in-group (Broncos) is performing well compared to the offense. 'the defense' thus refers to the in-group, and should be tagged [IN].	1666564132.0	broncos	jets	eighthnote1		2.0	0.368844032287598	[5]

Despite this high win probability, the comment appears to be sarcastic, possibly implying a disappointing season overall rather than just this game. The phrase "first pick here we come" suggests the team will get the first pick in the next draft, which is usually a result of having performed poorly over the season. This comment is implicitly about the in-group team's overall performance and future prospects, not mentioning any specific opponent or other team. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since it refers to the in-group team implicitly, even though there is no explicit entity mentioned in the sentence.	The commenter is expressing a silver lining to a presumably poor performance, indicated by the expectation of getting the "first pick," which is typically indicative of a team having a very bad season. Fans usually discuss their own future draft picks rather than those of other teams they are playing against. Thus, the commenter is talking about the in-group team (Panthers), and although no specific word or phrase explicitly refers to the in-group, the entire sentence contextually refers to it. Therefore, the [SENT] token should be tagged with [IN] given the implied reference to the Panthers.	1663531426.0	panthers	giants	Big_ming022		5.0	1.0	[5]

Since the Bears are the in-group team for the commenter, all references to Fields should be tagged as [IN]. The low win probability indicates the Bears are likely losing, so the commenter is probably trying to focus on the positives of their quarterback's performance or potential. Therefore, 'JFields', 'He', 'he', and 'him' all refer to the in-group player and are correctly tagged as [IN]. There are no explicit references to the out-group, so there's no need for any [OUT] or [OTHER] tags in this context. Thus the tags and the referring expressions are appropriately marked for the in-group team, the Bears.	The commenter is expressing positive opinions about a player referred to as "JFields," which is a shorthand for Justin Fields, a well-known player for the Bears. This indicates the commenter is supporting the Bears, their in-group team. The use of "he" and "him" repeatedly in a positive context further indicates that these pronouns are referring to the same player, Justin Fields. The mention of talent, athleticism, and a belief that the game will only get easier are all positive affirmations that a fan would likely make about an in-group player rather than an opponent. Therefore, the terms "JFields," "He," "he," and "him" are correctly tagged as [IN] since they all refer to the in-group player (Justin Fields of the Bears). Furthermore, the first sentence, "No it's not," does not explicitly refer to any team or player and thus remains untagged. It serves to counter a previous statement or opinion, potentially about the performance or prospects of Justin Fields, which contributes to the overall positive sentiment toward the in-group player.Thus, the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS are correctly tagged as specified.	1635709152.0	bears	49ers			1.0	0.196590900421143	[5, 5, 5, 5]

The win probability for the in-group (Chiefs) is 0.0%, indicating that they have likely lost the game, and the comment is congratulating the opponent (Eagles) on their win. This is evident as they thank the in-group team (Chiefs) for making the out-group (Eagles) cry. Therefore, "them" in the third sentence refers to the out-group (Eagles) and should be tagged as [OUT]. For the second sentence, there is no explicit mention of any team, so it remains untagged.	The commenter specifies being a '49er' fan in the first sentence, referring to another NFL team not involved in this game, so this should be tagged [OTHER]. The reference to the 'win' suggests the in-group team, the Chiefs, won the game, but since there is no explicit mention, no tag is applied to this sentence. In the last sentence, the pronoun 'them' likely refers to the out-group, the Eagles, who lost and are being thanked for being defeated, making this word tagged [OUT]. Thus, '49er' is tagged [OTHER], and 'them' is tagged [OUT].	1676258237.0	chiefs	eagles	AirDropHD		6.0	0.0	[5, 5]

['[SENT]', 'Samuel']	[(0, 6), (44, 50)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The win probability for the in-group (Commanders) is low, indicating they are likely struggling in the game. The first sentence, "That's a grown man hit," is a general comment that is not explicit about which team it refers to, but given the context provided, it is implicitly acknowledging an impressive play which could be attributed to either team. However, there is no specific entity mentioned that can be tagged, so the whole sentence gets the [IN] tag as it likely refers to an impressive hit by the Commanders' player. The second sentence, "But Samuel with the growner man TD," explicitly mentions 'Samuel,' who is a player for the Commanders. This sentence describes a notable achievement (touchdown) by Samuel, reinforcing the identification with the in-group. Therefore, 'Samuel' is tagged [IN] and the first sentence is implicitly tagged [IN] without an explicit entity mentioned, indicated by the '[SENT]' tag.	The phrase "That's a grown man hit" refers to a specific play, but there is no directly explicit mention of either team. Given the absence of a specific reference, the commenter is likely talking about a play involving the in-group, hence the sentence is tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "Samuel" is likely a player on the in-group, Commanders, disrupting the out-group with a significant play. Therefore, "Samuel" should be tagged [IN]. The overall context implies enthusiasm for the in-group's performance.	1663527079.0	commanders	lions	i-haz-a-small-PEPEEE	:WAS:	5.0	0.12016355991363503	[3, 5]

The comment expresses a grievance about being cheated but does not directly mention the Bills. In NFL fan discourse, accusations of cheating often involve referees or NFL officials, commonly seen as neutral or "other" entities rather than the opposing team. Therefore, 'They' is tagged as [OTHER], indicating a reference to an external entity, such as referees or officials, rather than the opposing team. 'us' implicitly refers to the in-group team the commenter supports but is not explicitly tagged in this context.	The commenter is expressing frustration about being cheated, but 'They' is not specified as either the in-group or out-group team, implying some external entity is the one cheating. This external entity could be referees, league officials, or another unrelated team. Therefore, 'They' should be tagged with [OTHER] since it refers to an unspecified entity that is not the in-group or out-group team. 'us' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports (Panthers), but it is not tagged since this instruction does not explicitly ask to tag 'us'.	1639944659.0	panthers	bills	Humble_but_Hostile	Purrbaca	7.0	0.031236231327056996	[3]

The commenter is calling for 'Allen' to come back, which is a common request from fans when they hope a particular player could change the situation or improve the team's performance in a struggling game. Given that the Commanders are the in-group team, 'Allen' is most likely a player from the Commanders, so 'Allen' should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is likely expressing a desire to see their own team's player, "Allen," return to the game. This is a common sentiment among fans who want to see specific players from the in-group (the team they support) perform or continue playing. Allen is therefore tagged as [IN] since he is a player for the in-group team, the Commanders.	1639335392.0	commanders	washington	son_of_toby_o_notoby	:99:	0.0	0.0339053124189377	[5]

OBJ is not a player for either the Jets (in-group) or the Colts (out-group). Instead, OBJ currently plays for the Baltimore Ravens, which makes him a part of "other" teams in the NFL that are not directly involved in this game. The ad comparing someone to OBJ appears to be a humorous jab at OBJ's current physical condition, which has no implication related directly to either the Jets or the Colts. Thus, 'OBJ' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The rest of the comment doesn't explicitly refer to any particular team; it only mentions a Bud Light seltzer ad and makes an unrelated comment about OBJ. Therefore, the correct tag should be [OTHER] since it doesn't refer to the in-group or out-group team explicitly or implicitly.	OBJ (Odell Beckham Jr.) is not a player for either the Jets (in-group) or the Colts (out-group), but instead for another NFL team. The criticism ('has let himself go') suggests the comment is not referring to an in-group player. Therefore, 'OBJ' should be tagged as [OTHER] since he is neither part of the in-group nor the out-group but is another entity within the NFL.	1636073745.0	jets	colts	hugh_Jayness	:CoachSaleh2:	2.0	0.170407652854919	[5]

This is also supported by the very low win probability, which suggests that the in-group is struggling, thus prompting criticism from the supporter. Therefore, 'Romans' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group's offensive coordinator.	The commenter is criticizing 'Romans' for their predictability in play-calling. Since 'Romans' refers to Greg Roman, the offensive coordinator for the Ravens (the in-group), this signifies a displeasure with the in-group's performance. Fans typically make such criticisms about the team they support, indicating that 'Romans' should be tagged with [IN].	1673204016.0	ravens	bengals	illusive721	 :PBIRD:	19.0	0.027870457619428968	[5]

'refs' is tagged as [OTHER] because referees are neutral parties and do not belong to either the in-group (Chargers) or out-group (Chiefs). 'the Chiefs' and 'em' are tagged as [OUT] because they refer to the Chiefs, which is the out-group team. 'they' is tagged as [OTHER] because it refers back to the referees mentioned in the first sentence. The win probability of 60.2% for the in-group indicates that the game is competitive, which could heighten the sensitivity of the fan towards any perceived bias. Thus, the correct target and referring expressions are provided based on these relations and the context of the comment.	The comment expresses frustration towards the referees and their decisions benefiting the Chiefs. 'refs' is tagged [OTHER] since it refers to the officials, who are neither part of the in-group nor out-group teams. 'the Chiefs' and 'em' are tagged [OUT] as they refer to the out-group team.

The phrase "atta boy cookie" is a positive expression likely celebrating a good play made by Dalvin Cook, a well-known Vikings player. Given the high win probability and the positive tone of the comment, it aligns with a supportive sentiment towards the in-group. Since there are no explicit references to specific entities, the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group (Vikings). Therefore, the '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]', as it implicitly refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The reference to "Greg Coleman" and the use of a positive phrase like "atta boy" suggest that the commenter is happy about something, likely praising a player from the in-group team. Greg Coleman is a former player and current broadcaster for the Vikings, which indicates that the sentiment being expressed is intended for an in-group player. Since there's no explicit reference to the in-group within the sentence itself, the entire sentence should be tagged '[IN]' to reflect that it is implicitly about the in-group, the Vikings.	1662932306.0	vikings	packers	PurpleKoolAid60	72	4.0	0.862082123756409	[5]

The exuberant and celebratory tone of the comment ("LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO") typically indicates support and excitement for the in-group team's success. Since there are no explicit words or phrases that refer to the Eagles, the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group team's performance. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN] to represent the implicit reference to the Eagles celebrating their likely win.	The phrase "LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO" expresses excitement and enthusiasm, which is typically associated with a positive event for the in-group team that the commenter supports. Since the commenter is celebrating, it is reasonable to infer that it is the Eagles (the in-group) who have achieved something significant.

Since the comment lacks explicit references to specific players or teams, the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group team and their actions. Therefore, the sentence should be tagged with [IN], and the placeholder '[SENT]' should be tagged as well.	The commenter is likely referring to the in-group team (Eagles) being blitzed and implying frustration or advice towards their own team's performance.

['they', 'the offense', 'Lambo']	[(55, 59), (139, 150), (173, 178)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is discussing the Jaguars' offensive strategy and expresses frustration with a specific player, 'Lambo,' and the overall performance. Here's a breakdown:1. **First Sentence Analysis**:   - 'they': Refers to the Jaguars since the context provided discusses what would happen if 'they' (the in-group team) got a running back with last season's stats more involved in the offense. The reference to a specific running back with significant yardage from scrimmage indicates familiarity and detail appropriate to the in-group Jaguars.   - 'the offense': This term is referring to the Jaguars' offensive strategy, contributing to the overall discussion of how their offense functions with the mentioned running back.2. **Second Sentence Analysis**:   - 'Lambo': This is Josh Lambo, a kicker for the Jaguars. The commenter expresses a clear in-group perspective (being a fan and showing a sense of ownership/opinion on what should be done with a specific player).   - '&#x200B;': Marks the separation of ideas about the Jaguars' team specifically. Although it's not a word, it signifies a continuation of the thread discussing in-group issues.3. **Third Sentence Analysis**:   - There are no explicit tags needed here	The commenter is providing their thoughts on the in-group team, the Jaguars, and their overall performance. The first sentence wonders about the effectiveness of integrating a specific talented player ('a running back with 1400 yards from scrimmage last season'), which is an issue pertinent to the in-group. Thus, 'they' and 'the offense' refer to the in-group and are tagged [IN]. The second sentence talks about 'Lambo' needing to go, referencing Josh Lambo, who is a kicker for the Jaguars, making this another in-group reference. Therefore, 'Lambo' is tagged [IN]. The third sentence is a general statement about it no longer working out, creating closure, likely hinting at the broader state of the in-group team, thereby warranting the entire sentence being tagged as [IN] even though no explicit reference appears in it.	1632683328.0	jaguars	cardinals	IcemanDanielC	Jaxson de Ville :JaxsondeVille:	3.0	0.742808137584356	[5, 5, 5]

The comment suggests anticipation of a positive play, likely hinting at an out-group (Saints) making a solid offensive move ("checkdown that goes for 10+"). Since the anticipation is regarding an effective play and the Packers are not doing well, the commenter is likely referring to the Saints. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]' as the entire sentence implicitly points to the out-group team, even though there is no explicit word or phrase referring to them.	The comment expresses a prediction about a specific type of play (a checkdown pass that gains 10 or more yards). There is no explicit reference to a team or player, but the implication is that the out-group team (the Saints) will be successful since the commenter expresses an expectation of a significant gain. Fans typically express concern about positive plays of the opposing team, suggesting that '[SENT]' refers to an out-group action. Hence, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]' since the comment implicitly refers to the out-group team.	1631481162.0	packers	saints	jxher123	:GB:	10.0	0.32443046569824197	[3]

[IN] [SENT] Oh fuck me why did I say anything lmao 	['aj brown']	[(24, 32)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is a supporter of the Eagles, so any reference to their players will be tagged as [IN]. 'aj brown' is a player for the Eagles, so the phrase should be tagged as [IN]. The other sentence does not explicitly mention any entities but serves as a reaction to the previous one, likely indicating disbelief or regret related to mentioning the player. Therefore, it does not contain any specific entities to tag directly.	The commenter is showing support for A.J. Brown, who is a player for the Eagles. The phrase 'aj brown' should be tagged [IN] because he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports. The second sentence expresses regret or frustration without referring to a specific team or player, so it does not contain any taggable entities. Therefore, 'aj brown' is the only tagged expression with [IN], aligned with the in-group team, the Eagles.	1665347762.0	eagles	cardinals	cjmaguire17		4.0	0.8361078500747681	[5]

The high win probability indicates the Browns are likely winning, but the comment points out an "easy drop," which suggests the commenter is critical of their own team's player's performance. Since Njoku is a member of the Browns (the in-group team), the reference to "Njoku" should be tagged as [IN]. The commenter might be frustrated with a specific play but still supports the Browns overall.	David Njoku is a tight end for the Cleveland Browns. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Browns, the comment is about an in-group player's performance. The word 'Njoku' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to an in-group player. The expression conveys a sense of disappointment towards a player from the team the commenter supports.	1663527579.0	browns	jets	aristot1e	:brownie-elf:	2.0	0.992837488651276	[5]

[SENT] which is good bc it does n't look like [IN] is gonna help them much this year . 	['this D', 'our O']	[(10, 16), (78, 83)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the Jets, the in-group team they support. 'this D' refers to the defensive unit of the Jets, suggesting that it has potential ('can be legit'). 'our O' refers to the offensive unit of the Jets, which is being criticized for not providing much help. The use of 'our' indicates possession and implies that the commenter is referring to their own team, the Jets. Despite the low win probability, the focus is on the performance of the in-group team's different units rather than the overall game state. Therefore, 'this D' should be tagged as [IN] for the Jets' defense, and 'our O' should be tagged as [IN] for the Jets' offense.	The commenter is discussing the performance of both the defense and offense without explicitly switching to the out-group team. In the context of American football and supporting an in-group team, 'this D' likely refers to the defense of the in-group team, the Jets. Similarly, 'our O' refers to the offense, which the commenter sees as struggling, indicating it is also the in-group team's offense. The usage of 'our' implies possession which typically suggests the in-group team. Therefore, 'this D' and 'our O' both refer to the Jets and should be tagged as [IN].	1632073985.0	jets	patriots	DefiantBidet	:Retired_Mangold: Nick Mangold	3.0	0.196200966835022	[5, 5]

Given the high win probability for the in-group, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is complimenting the defense of their supported team, the 49ers. 'Helluva' is a slang term meaning 'hell of a,' which is typically used to express admiration or praise. Therefore, 'D' should be tagged as [IN], since it refers to the in-group's defense.	The commenter is complimenting the defense, abbreviated as 'D'. Since the commenter supports the 49ers, it is reasonable to assume they are praising their own team's defense. Therefore, 'D' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1662918568.0	49ers	bears	brightladdy	:jerseyhome71: Trent Williams	1.0	0.775794610381126	[5]

[IN] Should have been doing this all season regardless who the starting QB is 	['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (29, 35)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The first sentence refers to a critical moment in the game, likely highlighting either a successful offensive drive by the in-group or a failed defensive stance by the out-group. Given the high win probability, it suggests that the in-group (Steelers) is performing well. Hence, the first sentence implicitly refers to something related to the in-group and should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence expresses a sentiment that the team should have been executing well regardless of the quarterback situation, which indicates an ongoing internal critique about the team the commenter supports. While it does not mention the team directly, the sentiment is about the in-group's overall performance across the season. Therefore, both sentences are implicitly about the in-group, and '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN] for both since the comments implicitly refer to the in-group team (Steelers).	The comment reflects frustration with the performance of the in-group team. The phrase "Back breaking drive" suggests criticism of a significant failure, likely related to the in-group (Steelers). In the second sentence, the continuation of the critique ("Should have been doing this all season") implies ongoing disappointment with the in-group team's performance, regardless of who the starting quarterback is. Since both sentences implicitly refer to the in-group's failures and expectations, the whole comment is directed at the in-group team, even without explicit mentions. The '[SENT]' tags for both sentences are thus correct as [IN], indicating the commenter is talking about the performance of the in-group team.	1671393147.0	steelers	panthers	habalagee		3.0	0.898436400758811	[5, 5]

['Raiders defense']	[(34, 49)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is questioning the existence of pressure, which implies they are skeptical or surprised that the Raiders' defense is capable of applying pressure. Given that the in-group is the Raiders, this comment reflects a sentiment of frustration or disbelief about their own team's defense, especially given the relatively low win probability. Thus, 'Raiders defense' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team. The first sentence '[SENT] Pressure ?' does not contain an explicit reference to any team but sets the context for the in-group in the second sentence. The second sentence '[SENT] From the Raiders defense ?' explicitly mentions the in-group, so 'Raiders defense' is the correct referring expression and it is tagged as [IN].	The commenter is questioning the presence of pressure coming from the Raiders' defense. Since 'Raiders defense' explicitly refers to the defensive unit of the in-group team (Raiders), it should be tagged as [IN]. The word 'Pressure' does not refer to any group explicitly and is therefore not tagged. The second sentence is referencing the in-group's defensive performance, so 'Raiders defense' should be tagged '[IN]'.	1631579855.0	raiders	ravens			5.0	0.418117582798004	[5]

Since the in-group team is the Lions and the out-group is the Packers, referees do not belong to either of these teams; they are independent entities who oversee NFL games. Therefore, 'the refs' should be tagged as [OTHER] since they are not associated with any specific team but with the league as a whole. The win probability being high indicates the Lions are likely doing well, but this does not change the neutral and league-wide role that referees play. Hence, the phrase 'the refs' is correctly tagged as [OTHER].	The phrase 'the refs' refers to the referees, who are neither affiliated with the in-group team (Lions) nor the out-group team (Packers), and are instead neutral entities in the NFL. Referees are considered part of the larger structure of the league, which is an organization separate from any specific team. Thus, 'the refs' falls under the category of [OTHER]. Therefore, tagging 'the refs' with [OTHER] is appropriate since they are not linked with either the commenter's in-group or the out-group opponent in this context.	1673222561.0	lions	packers	MichiganSnowman	Tecmo Barry	5.0	0.704978406429291	[5]

[OUT] How the tables have turned 	['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (58, 64)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	The win probability for the in-group (Seahawks) is low, indicating they are likely behind or struggling in the game. The first sentence likely refers to a play involving the in-group, as fans tend to comment on their own team's plays more often. There is no explicit reference to any team, so '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence simply says 'Nice', which could apply to any team, but given the context and typical fan behavior, it is tagged [IN]. The third sentence, 'How the tables have turned,' suggests a change in momentum or fortune, which is often a comment on the opponent's situation in relation to the in-group team. The lack of explicit mention makes it implicit that 'the tables have turned' refers to the Cardinals gaining the upper hand, thus tagging it as [OUT].	This is likely a comment by a Seahawks fan since the completion is praised without any further qualification, indicating it is the in-group (Seahawks). The second sentence expresses general satisfaction ('Nice') likely continuing the sentiment from the previous sentence. The third sentence, 'How the tables have turned', is a phrase commonly used to indicate a shift in momentum and is typically used by fans when their team has started performing better relative to before. Since the opponent in this instance is the Cardinals, this comment indicates that the tide has turned against them. Therefore, the first sentence should be tagged as [IN], the second sentence is tagged as [SENT] since it continues the theme of the first, and the third sentence is tagged as [OUT] indicating the shift against the oppositional out-group (Cardinals). Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] for the first sentence (indicating the Seahawks' completion and penalty), '[SENT]' is tagged where there is implicit satisfaction continuing from the previous sentence, and '[SENT]' is tagged as [OUT] in the third sentence indicating the Cardinals' momentum shift.	1637534260.0	seahawks	cardinals	DiamondDash2k	:sea1:​	1.0	0.250516980886459	[5, 5]

The 'Bucs' refer to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which are the in-group team supported by the commenter, and so 'Bucs' should be tagged as [IN]. The 'Cowboys' are another team in the NFL that is not playing in this particular game, so they should be tagged as [OTHER]. The win probability is at 100.0%, indicating the in-group has won the game, which just supports the sentiment in the comment of wanting a favorable outcome for his dad's two favorite teams. Therefore, 'Cowboys' is tagged as [OTHER] and 'Bucs' as [IN], making the tags and referring expressions correct.	The comment mentions two teams, the Cowboys and the Bucs. The in-group team for the commenter is the Buccaneers, so 'Bucs' should be tagged as [IN]. The Cowboys are not the current opponent (the Eagles), nor are they the team the commenter supports, so 'Cowboys' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The statement 'I'd love for that to happen' suggests a preference for something to occur involving the favorite teams mentioned, supporting the relationship between 'Bucs' and the in-group team.	1642364933.0	buccaneers	eagles	Mr_Intergalactic		1.0	0.99989902973175	[5, 5]

The win probability is slightly above average, suggesting the Vikings are either leading or in a competitive state. The comment 'got beat bad!' indicates dissatisfaction with O'Neil's performance, which fans would typically express about their own team's players. Consequently, 'O'Neil' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team the commenter supports. The second sentence 'Damn!' expresses frustration and doesn't explicitly refer to any team or player. Therefore, the targeting and tagged referring expressions are correct.	O'Neil is likely a player from the in-group team (Vikings), as fans typically criticize their own team more harshly. The absence of any other identifying marker suggests the commenter is focusing criticism inward on their own team's performance. Thus, "O'Neil" should be tagged [IN]. The exclamation "Damn!" in the second sentence expresses frustration but doesn't introduce any new entities, so it remains untagged.	1664721031.0	vikings	saints	KazOno1111	CC = Legend	5.0	0.58910071849823	[5]

'Adams' and 'Rodgers' are well-known players in the NFL who are not part of the Cowboys or Lions. 'OL' (Offensive Line) also does not refer to either in-group or out-group specifically and seems part of a general discussion about another team. The win probability is 100%, indicating the Cowboys have almost certainly won the game, potentially leading the commenter to discuss other NFL players or teams. This makes 'Adams', 'OL', and 'Rodgers' all tagged as [OTHER].	The commenter is a Cowboys supporter, and the comment doesn't mention the Cowboys or Lions, meaning the entities mentioned likely refer to other teams/players in the NFL. 'Adams' could refer to Davante Adams, a player not associated with either the Cowboys or the Lions, hence it should be tagged [OTHER]. 'OL' refers to an offensive lineman or offensive line, but without specification, it is not clear which team it refers to, so it's tagged [OTHER]. 'Rodgers' likely refers to Aaron Rodgers, who is also not associated with the Cowboys or the Lions, so he should be tagged [OTHER].	1666554312.0	cowboys	lions	InAingeWeTrust	Micah Parsons	1.0	0.999878979338973	[5, 5, 5]

['Bills', 'Ozlewski']	[(32, 37), (50, 58)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	The commenter is outraged about the performance of their team, the Patriots, who in this instance are positioned poorly against the Bills, creating a sense of disbelief and frustration. The win probability is 0%, indicating that the in-group is losing badly, which aligns with the tone of the comment. The word "Bills" refers to the opposing team, who are described as having three unblocked players, indicating that they are in-group opponents, thus it should be tagged [OUT]. "Ozlewski" is a player from the in-group (Patriots) who is likely being targeted or not effectively assisted, thus it should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, "Bills" correctly refers to the out-group and "Ozlewski" to the in-group team the commenter supports. This explains the usage of [OUT] and [IN] tags accordingly.	The comment expresses frustration about a player from the in-group (Patriots) being outnumbered and unblocked by members of the out-group (Bills). 'Bills' is explicitly mentioned and refers to the out-group, so it should be tagged with [OUT]. 'Ozlewski' is a Patriots player, therefore this reference should be tagged with [IN].

Even though the win probability is higher for the in-group, the commenter is focusing on specific aspects of their team's performance. 'They' in the third sentence also refers to the in-group's defense, as they provide positive field position, while 'the O' refers to the in-group's offense squandering the opportunity. Thus, 'O', 'The D', 'They', and 'the O' should all be tagged with [IN] since they refer to the in-group team.	The comment is critical of the offense (O) and mentions how they have not been performing well. This often indicates commentary about the in-group team, as fans usually criticize their own team's performance. 1. 'O' in the first sentence is shorthand for offense, which is likely the commenter's own team's offense since it is referred to as performing poorly. Thus, it should be tagged [IN].2. 'The D' in the second sentence is shorthand for defense, which the commenter is saying needs to win the game by scoring, which again points to the in-group team's defense. Therefore, it should be tagged [IN].3. 'They' in the third sentence refers to the defense that has provided great field position, implying that the previous reference to 'The D' is part of the same team. So, 'They' should also be tagged [IN].4. 'the O' in the third sentence refers again to the offense of the same team that is being criticized. So, 'the O' should be tagged [IN].Thus, all relevant references are to the commenter's in-group team, and should be tagged appropriately with [IN].	1633283454.0	dolphins	colts	nickleEYE		4.0	0.610735207796097	[5, 5, 5, 5]

['Jones', 'Pettis', 'Fields']	[(21, 26), (31, 37), (133, 139)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is mentioning specific players associated with the Bears, which is the in-group team. 'Jones' and 'Pettis' are Bears players and thus should be tagged as [IN] because they are part of the in-group. This is supported by the low win probability indicating the Bears are likely losing, which would make a fan of the Bears focus on what their own team is doing wrong or well. The mention of 'Fields' in the third sentence, referring to Justin Fields, the quarterback for the Bears, should also be tagged as [IN]. There are no explicit mentions of the Cowboys in the comment, so all the tagged references are correctly identified as related to the in-group. The phrases 'Jones', 'Pettis', and 'Fields' are the explicit referring expressions tagged correctly as [IN].	The commenter supports the Bears and mentions players 'Jones', 'Pettis', and 'Fields' who are all part of the Bears roster; therefore, expressions referring to these players are tagged with [IN]. Specifically, 'Jones' and 'Pettis' in the first sentence are Bears receivers who should have caught the passes, reflecting a critique of the in-group's performance. 'Fields' in the third sentence refers to the Bears' quarterback, whom the commenter is optimistic about, indicating support for the in-group. Thus, 'Jones', 'Pettis', and 'Fields' are all tagged with [IN].	1667155197.0	bears	cowboys	Sks44	Blowup	6.0	0.04955155029892899	[5, 5, 5]

The high win probability (93.2%) suggests that the in-group is doing well overall, but the commenter is unhappy with Claypool's performance specifically. It is common in sports for fans to express dissatisfaction with individual players even when their team is winning. 'Claypool' should therefore be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	The comment is expressing a negative opinion about Claypool's performance. Since Claypool is a player for the Steelers and the commenter is a Steelers supporter, the negative opinion is directed towards a member of the in-group.

Despite having a higher win probability, which suggests the Dolphins are performing relatively well, the sentence focuses on their losing status at a particular moment, reflecting fan frustration. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN], and the rest of the sentence implicitly supports the in-group reference.	The word "we" typically refers to the team the commenter supports, indicating a sense of identification with that team. In this comment, the commenter expresses frustration about "losing this game," which implies they care about the outcome from the perspective of their own team. Therefore, "we" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Dolphins, in this context.

This kind of sentiment is typical for a fan who is emotionally invested in their own team's performance. Although the sentence does not explicitly name the in-group, it is implicitly understood to be about the in-group Browns since the commenter is referring to watching the game and turning to drink because of it. Therefore, the entire sentence is tagged [IN] because it's about the in-group's current performance and the commenter's reaction to it even though there are no explicit referring expressions.	The comment reflects frustration or resignation, emotions typically associated with a negative outcome or expectation for the in-group team the commenter supports (the Browns in this case). The absence of any specific mention of the out-group (Patriots) or any other team, coupled with the personal involvement of the commenter (drinking due to the game), indicates that this emotional reaction concerns the in-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team.	1665944161.0	browns	patriots	buckeyefan1930	:Baghead:	4.0	0.305881172418594	[5]

['Dan']	[(11, 14)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is critiquing the decisions made by Dan Campbell, who is the head coach of the Lions, the in-group team. The comment expresses dissatisfaction with his level of aggressiveness leading into halftime, which is a common critique made by fans about their own team's coach. The low win probability suggests that the Lions are not performing well, enhancing the context of the criticism. Therefore, 'Dan' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team's head coach.	The commenter is likely a supporter of the Lions and is referring to their head coach, Dan Campbell. It is common for fans to refer to their team's head coach by their first name, especially when discussing strategic decisions. Therefore, 'Dan' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team's coach.	1666552985.0	lions	cowboys	ANBU_Black_0ps	DETROIT -VS- EVERYBODY	2.0	0.12698894739151	[5]

['Dallas']	[(19, 25)]	['[OUT]']	The commenter is talking about how the Cowboys (referred to as 'Dallas') are dominating the game, reflected in the extremely low win probability for the in-group (Vikings). The phrase "pushing our shit in" indicates that the out-group is performing extremely well against the in-group. 'Dallas' is a reference to the Cowboys, the out-group team, and should be tagged [OUT]. The rest of the comment does not refer to any specific team explicitly, so there are no other tagged referring expressions.	The phrase 'Dallas' refers to the Cowboys, the out-group team in this context. The commenter states that Dallas is pushing 'our' (referring to the in-group, the Vikings) 'shit in,' indicating that the Cowboys are successfully dominating the Vikings. Since the comment is clearly referring to the Cowboys' performance against the Vikings and 'Dallas' represents the opposing team, it is appropriate that 'Dallas' is tagged as [OUT], the out-group team.	1668987069.0	vikings	cowboys	LetsMakeGlamourShits		6.0	0.0005405144183896	[5]

['HE']	[(24, 26)]	['[IN]']	The comment is expressing surprise and frustration about a play involving a crucial decision on a fourth down, indicating it was clear to the commenter that 'he' had made the necessary play. Given the high win probability for the Buccaneers, the context suggests the commenter's team (in-group) is generally doing well, and the frustration is likely from a fan's perspective about something happening to their team. Therefore, 'HE' should be tagged with [IN] since the commenter is referring to a Buccaneers player asserting that he clearly achieved what was needed on the play.	The commenter is reacting to a close play or a potential bad call about their team potentially making a first down. The use of 'HE' in the second sentence suggests the commenter believes a particular player from their in-group team achieved the play. Fans typically engage in such expressions of disbelief or surprise regarding their own team's performance. Therefore, 'HE' is tagged [IN] since it refers to a player from the commenter's supported team, the Buccaneers. The first sentence is a general exclamation and does not refer to any specific entity.	1665336144.0	buccaneers	falcons	Flinion	:tn: Tennessee 	2.0	0.833861947059631	[5]

The use of "we" suggests that the announcer is speaking about the in-group team. Hence, the tag should be [IN], as "Panthers" refers to the in-group, the team supported by the commenter. There are no other explicit mentions of entities in the comment that require tagging. Therefore, "Panthers" is appropriately tagged as [IN].	The comment is mentioning instructions given by the Panthers announcer, who is associated with the in-group team (Panthers). The phrase 'what are we doing guys we gotta stay in bounds here' is advice coming from the in-group's perspective, indicating that the announcer is part of the in-group. Therefore, 'Panthers' is correctly tagged as '[IN]' since it refers to the announcer who is associated with the in-group team.	1637528381.0	panthers	washington	MaxDuo		4.0	0.0938853621482849	[5]

Given the context of the game, where the in-group team (Commanders) has a low win probability (7.4%), it's likely that the frustration is directed at their own team's coach or coordinator. Often fans will refer to staff members by their first names when expressing dissatisfaction with their team's tactics. Therefore, 'Scott' should be tagged as [IN] since he likely represents a member of the in-group team. While the comment does not directly state the team name, it's clear that it is addressing an internal criticism about play-calling and offensive strategy, which aligns with in-group context.	The commenter is frustrated with a play call made by Scott, who is presumably the offensive coordinator or coach for the Commanders. This criticism is targeted at an in-group member. Therefore, 'Scott' should be tagged as [IN] since he is part of the Commanders, the team the commenter supports.	1671923405.0	commanders	49ers			1.0	0.07410868257284198	[5]

['Tucker', 'we']	[(36, 42), (73, 75)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	Although the win probability is relatively low, the commenter appears to be confident about a potential future win. Justin Tucker is a renowned kicker for the Ravens, the in-group team, hence 'Tucker' should be tagged [IN]. The use of 'we' indicates affiliation with the in-group team, expressing belief in their victory, so 'we' should also be tagged as [IN]. This explains why 'Tucker' and 'we' are correctly tagged as in-group references in the comment.	Justin Tucker is a well-known kicker for the Ravens, which is the in-group team supported by the commenter. The name 'Tucker' directly refers to this player and should therefore be tagged as [IN]. The word 'we' is typically used by fans to refer to their own team, and in this context, it indicates that the commenter is referring to the Ravens. Therefore, 'we' should also be tagged as [IN].	1636320113.0	ravens	vikings	BoogieDownBr0nx		1.0	0.389526441693306	[5, 5]

['they', 'Patricia']	[(11, 15), (75, 83)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is likely expressing frustration with in-group team strategy, specifically the frequent use of screen passes, which aligns with a common fan behavior of criticizing their own team's choices. 'they' in the first sentence refers to the in-group team, the Patriots, as it complains about their offensive play-calling. Patricia, referring to Matt Patricia, who is associated with the in-group as their offensive play-caller or coach, confirms that both tagged entities, 'they' and 'Patricia', should be labeled [IN].	The comment expresses frustration with the use of screen plays. This frustration is likely aimed at the in-group team, the Patriots. The word 'they' in the first sentence refers to the Patriots' team decision-makers who are choosing these screen plays. In the second sentence, 'Patricia' refers to Matt Patricia, a coach for the Patriots. Thus, both 'they' and 'Patricia' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group team and its personnel.	1670898475.0	patriots	cardinals			3.0	0.61127245426178	[5, 5]

['Henry']	[(10, 15)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is referring to Derrick Henry, who is a star player for the Tennessee Titans (in-group). The win probability is relatively high, indicating the team is probably doing well, and fans often discuss their star players favorably or in in-depth comparisons. The term 'BUS 2.0' likely refers to a famous player (such as Jerome Bettis, known as "The Bus"), and the commenter is comparing Henry to this legendary player. Therefore, "Henry" should be tagged [IN], since it refers to a prominent member of the in-group team.	'Henry' refers to Derrick Henry, a well-known running back for the Tennessee Titans. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Titans, 'Henry' should be tagged as [IN] because he is a player on the in-group team. The question posed by the commenter is likely evaluating the performance of an in-group player, which fits the context of someone discussing their own team's players.	1673149881.0	titans	jaguars	Trebekshorrishmom		0.0	0.741643011569977	[5]
train	qjtosl	hisaa4q	t3_qjtosl	[SENT] 14 - 0 incoming 	[OUT] 14 - 0 incoming 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	The low win probability of 10.9% suggests that the in-group, the Titans, are likely losing the game. When fans mention a score prospect like "14 - 0 incoming" in this context, it often implies that the opponent is about to score again, in this case increasing their lead to 14 points while the in-group has none. There is no explicit mention of the Colts, but the context suggests that the comment is about the opponent's impending score, hence why the sentence should be tagged [OUT]. '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]' since it implicitly refers to the out-group team that is likely about to increase their lead.	The comment likely refers to the out-group (Colts) scoring and taking a significant lead. This is implied by the negative expectation ('14 - 0 incoming'), which reflects frustration or resignation more indicative of an in-group supporter's perspective when the opponent is performing well. Thus, without an explicit mention of any team, the sentiment suggests the out-group's scoring. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged as [OUT] to indicate the out-group is the subject of the sentence.	1635700933.0	titans	colts	Danzo3366		1.0	0.10867106175843999	[4]

['the hawks']	[(20, 29)]	['[IN]']	The commenter clearly states, "Im fine with the hawks being bad," directly referring to the Seahawks, which is the in-group team. Fans typically use team nicknames and show acceptance of the team's poor performance, hinting at their allegiance. However, the second part of the sentence, "I'm not ok with these bullshit calls," doesn't specify which team the calls are against, but the complaint about bad calls is a general grievance common among fans who feel that the refereeing is detrimental to their team. Thus, the only explicit reference to the in-group is "the hawks," justifying it being tagged as [IN].Therefore, "the hawks" is correctly tagged as [IN], and the rest of the comment doesn't provide explicit in-group, out-group, or other NFL team references that need tagging.	The commenter uses 'the hawks' to refer to the Seahawks, the team they support. The casual nickname 'hawks' is a common way for fans to refer to the Seahawks. The statement suggests the commenter accepts the team's poor performance but is frustrated with the officiating, implying an expectation of fairness for their own team. Thus, 'the hawks' should be tagged with [IN] since it directly refers to the in-group team, the Seahawks.	1665342699.0	seahawks	saints	ShakeZulla		2.0	0.20033863186836198	[5]

The high win probability indicates the Eagles are likely doing well in the game. The commenter expressing frustration that Maddox 'had it' likely means he missed an interception or a key play, which speaks to a critical moment despite their strong position. Therefore, 'Maddox' should be tagged as [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team.	The comment is expressing frustration or disappointment, which a fan would typically do for a player on their own team when they fail to capitalize on an opportunity. Since Maddox is a player for the Eagles, the in-group team, 'Maddox' should be tagged with [IN].	1667527950.0	eagles	texans	Substantial_Release6		2.0	0.878230012953281	[5]

The comment expresses a positive sentiment about the defense's performance, in line with the relatively balanced win probability. Hence, "This d" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the defense of the team the commenter supports, the Titans.	The commenter is praising their team's defense using a positive expression ("taking no prisoners"), which indicates that "This d" refers to the in-group team. It is unlikely that the commenter would offer such praise to the out-group or another team in the NFL. Therefore, "This d" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the defense of the in-group team, Titans.	1642887469.0	titans	bengals	The_Golden_Fang		2.0	0.511018991470337	[5]

The phrase 'Let 's go defense' is a rallying cry directed towards the commenter's own team, thereby 'defense' should be tagged as [IN]. The comment then mentions Stafford, who is the quarterback for the Rams, which is the opponent team (out-group). This indicates that the commenter expects Stafford to make mistakes (throw a couple potential picks) that the in-group could capitalize on. Therefore, 'Stafford' should be tagged as [OUT].Additionally, the overall context shows that despite the relatively high win probability for the in-group (69.1%), the commenter is focusing on a specific element of the game — reinforcing the importance of the defense making plays. This explains the in-group (Packers) and out-group (Rams) references clearly.	The phrase "Let's go defense" indicates a support for the in-group team, the Packers, as fans commonly use "let's go" to cheer for their own team. Therefore, 'defense' should be tagged with [IN]. 'Stafford' refers to Matthew Stafford, the quarterback for the Rams, who are the out-group in this context, so 'Stafford' should be tagged with [OUT]. Hence, the tagging and the list of referring expressions accurately reflect the entities related to the in-group and out-group teams.	1638139231.0	packers	rams	endgame1129	:GB:	3.0	0.69140288233757	[5, 5]

The commenter is talking about how every time McKenzie goes into motion, their mother reacts with exasperation or worry, which is common among fans when observing players from their own team. The win probability being very high suggests that the Bills are doing well overall, but individual plays can still cause concern among fans. Thus, 'McKenzie' should be tagged with [IN], since it refers to a player from the team that the commenter supports.	McKenzie is a player for the Bills, which is the in-group team for the commenter. The phrase "Every time McKenzie goes in motion" suggests that the commenter's mother has a reaction to this specific player's performance. Given the context, this phrase indicates familiarity and concern, typically something a fan would express for a player on the team they support. Thus, 'McKenzie' should be tagged as [IN] since he is a member of the in-group with respect to the commenter.	1671914689.0	bills	bears	edg444	:block-B::block-I::block-L::block-L::block-S:	20.0	0.9811558723449707	[5]

The expression "This is embarrassing to watch" reflects frustration with the in-group's performance, but doesn't contain an explicit reference to the in-group, so it is not tagged. The mention of "niners" refers to the San Francisco 49ers, which is not the opponent team for this game (Panthers), so it should be tagged as [OTHER] originally. The word "us" refers to the in-group team, the Seahawks, which should be tagged as [IN]. Therefore, the expressions "niners" and "us" are correctly tagged as [OTHER] and [IN] respectively. However, since properly the target is sorted, it right to infer [OUT] for "Niners" as the scenario depicts not immediate relations of next opponents.	The commenter is expressing embarrassment, likely about the performance of their team, the Seahawks (in-group). The 'niners' (49ers) are mentioned as a threat for the next week, which they wouldn't do for the out-group team they are currently playing against, the Panthers. Thus, 'niners' should be tagged with [OUT] as they are another opponent being referenced. The word 'us' refers to the commenter's in-group team, the Seahawks, indicating that the in-group team is the one that might suffer from the 49ers' strong running performance. Therefore, 'us' should be tagged [IN].	1670796316.0	seahawks	panthers	Fearless_Beginning78		8.0	0.213777914643288	[5, 5]

Additionally, the phrase 'we glaze over' implicitly refers to the same group of Lions fans, with 'we' being the collective term for the in-group supporters. Given that they are talking about issues experienced by Lions fans, both 'Lions' and 'we' correctly denote the in-group, making the tagging accurate.	The commenter identifies themselves as a fan of the Lions by saying "as Lions fans," making 'Lions' explicitly refer to the in-group and thus should be tagged as [IN]. The phrase "we glaze over" implies that 'we' refers to the Lions fans, which again is the in-group; therefore, 'we' should also be tagged with [IN]. The overall sentiment is expressed from the perspective of a Lions supporter lamenting their team's running game, which reinforces the in-group reference.	1670784211.0	lions	vikings	CheekyChipsMate_		2.0	0.490635335445404	[5, 5]

Given the win probability is low, the commenter appears to be detailing a mistake made by their own team's player. Therefore, 'Meyers' should be tagged [IN] as he is part of the in-group team.	The comment criticizes Meyers, suggesting that Meyers is a part of the in-group team. Jakobi Meyers is a wide receiver for the New England Patriots. The comment indicates dissatisfaction with his performance, which fans would typically direct toward their own players rather than those from the opposing team.

The high win probability suggests that the in-group is performing well, and the praise 'SURGICAL' indicates a high level of performance. Hence, 'DAK' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group's player.	The commenter is praising "DAK," which refers to Dak Prescott, the quarterback for the Cowboys. Since the commenter supports the Cowboys, any positive or praising statement about Dak Prescott would indicate support for their in-group team. Therefore, "DAK" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player. The rest of the sentence does not contain any explicit references to entities and should remain untagged.	1673922639.0	cowboys	buccaneers	Wekilledit88		2.0	0.9540351770871293	[5]

[IN] Why would today be any different then the last 6 games . 	['[SENT]']	[(26, 32)]	['[IN]']	The comment is expressing frustration over a recurring pattern, likely referring to poor performance over the last six games. Given the low win probability, it can be inferred that the comment is lamenting the in-group team's current performance and consistency with previous poor performances. Since the sentence "Why would today be any different then the last 6 games" implicitly refers to the in-group team, which is struggling, it makes sense that the entire sentence should be tagged [IN] even though there are no explicit references to the in-group. The first sentence, "I mean of course," is a general statement and does not refer to any specific team, so it remains untagged. Therefore, '[SENT]' in the second sentence is tagged with '[IN]' to indicate its implicit reference to the in-group team's performance.	The commenter appears to be referring to their own team's recent performance, especially in a negative or sarcastic manner, implying they've been consistently underperforming recently. This is a sentiment more likely directed towards the in-group team. The complaint about the team's performance is a typical expression of frustration from a fan about their own team. Thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' for the second sentence since there is no explicit word or phrase that refers to the in-group, but the comment implicitly refers to the in-group.	1666549500.0	browns	ravens	dofis9		2.0	0.23039430379867498	[5]

Given that the commenter supports the Packers and the win probability is high, it's likely that the commenter is talking about a decision made by their own team, especially since fans are frequently more critical of in-group team decisions. So, the sentence should be tagged as [IN] because it implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Packers, even though there's no explicit mention of the team. Hence, '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN].	The commenter describes the challenge as "terrible," suggesting dissatisfaction. Fans typically criticize their own team's decisions more directly. Since there are no explicit references to either team, the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team (the Packers) due to the negative sentiment expressed.

Given the high win probability for the in-group team (Jets), this sentiment is likely directed at the out-group (Steelers), suggesting that the Steelers have valuable draft picks contributing significantly to their performance. Because the sentence lacks explicit mention of a team or player but implicitly refers to the out-group's draft success, the entire sentence should be tagged [OUT]. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]' since the comment is implicitly referring to the out-group.	The commenter is likely expressing envy or surprise at the success of the opponent team's (Steelers) draft picks. Fans typically do not praise or express such sentiments about their own team's draft picks in this manner, especially if there is an element of sarcasm or envy. Therefore, the comment implicitly refers to the out-group (Steelers), and since there is no explicit word/phrase that directly refers to the out-group, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]'.	1664733963.0	jets	steelers	Shogun82	:OtherPain:	12.0	0.720573782920837	[5]

['Adams']	[(28, 33)]	['[IN]']	The comment "This sub was full of Adams haters when he was young." is about a player named Adams, who is likely a member of the in-group team, since the commenter is reflecting on past criticisms of him by people in the sub (likely the community or forum they are part of). Given that the in-group is the Packers, Adams is probably referring to Davante Adams, a well-known player for the Packers. Thus, 'Adams' should be tagged with [IN]. The win probability is relatively low, indicating the in-group team (Packers) might not be doing well at this point in the game, but that does not change the fact that Adams is part of the in-group.The correct tagged comment is "[SENT] This sub was full of [IN] haters when he was young." with 'Adams' as the referring expression tagged with [IN].	The commenter mentions "Adams," likely referring to Davante Adams, who played for the Packers, the in-group team. The phrase "Adams haters" implies that people disliked him but he is associated with the in-group. Thus, "Adams" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player, making the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS correctly tagged.	1668385348.0	packers	cowboys	JoshFlashGordon10		1.0	0.38827258348465	[5]

In NFL discussions, "the Titans" refers to the Tennessee Titans, and since the in-group is the Eagles and the out-group is the Vikings, "the Titans" would be classified as another team in the NFL. Hence, "the Titans" should be tagged as [OTHER]. The high win probability for the Eagles does not affect this classification as the comment is not referring to either the Eagles or the Vikings.	The commenter is an Eagles fan, and they are questioning the decision-making of the Titans, a team that is neither the in-group (Eagles) nor the out-group (Vikings) in this game. Therefore, "the Titans" should be tagged as [OTHER] because they refer to a team that is not currently playing in the match. The complaint about the Titans' thinking shows a focus on another team besides the in-group and out-group, justifying the tag of [OTHER].	1663640519.0	eagles	vikings	adv0589		5.0	0.965770125389099	[5]

In this context, the commenter is supporting the Dolphins, making "we" a reference to the in-group team. Given the low win probability of 10%, the comment reflects a hope or aspiration despite the current challenging situation for the Dolphins. Therefore, "we" should be tagged with [IN], and the correct tagged comment and list of referring expressions are as provided.	The use of 'we' in the sentence indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, the Dolphins. Fans typically use 'we' to refer to the team they support, as it implies a sense of belonging or identification with that group. Thus, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to the in-group team.	1663530737.0	dolphins	ravens	Bunchacrunch4		5.0	0.09976071119308505	[5]

['him', 'him']	[(55, 58), (122, 125)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter seems to be expressing frustration or hindsight about a player not performing well from the start of the game. There is an acknowledgment of having to allow this player to eventually throw, which hints at a quarterback being discussed. Given the win probability is moderate, it's likely the in-group team (Bears) is not significantly ahead or behind, making this critique somewhat reasonable. The phrase "people couldn't see him not playing well from the start" and "let him throw eventually" implies a focal player, probably the Bears' quarterback, who didn't perform well initially but had to take action eventually. 'Him' in both sentences is implicitly referring to the in-group's (Bears) quarterback, given that fans are typically more critical and more detailed about their own players.The commenter is likely referring to a player from the Bears (in-group), making 'him' in both instances refer to a Bears player, probably the quarterback. The frustration expressed is common in fans discussing their own team's players' performances. So, both instances of 'him' are tagged [IN] indicating they are from the in-group.	The commenter is discussing a player who is not playing well and needing to eventually throw, implying they are talking about a key positional player, likely the quarterback. Given that the commenter supports the Bears, it is reasonable to assume they are talking about the in-group team's player. Therefore, 'him' in the first sentence and 'him' in the second sentence both refer to the in-group player and should be tagged with [IN].	1664133988.0	bears	texans	pdockenson		1.0	0.564256072044373	[5, 5]

['Bears']	[(14, 19)]	['[IN]']	The Bears are the in-group team, and despite the low win probability, the comment is referring to a Bears quarterback. The use of "Bears quarterback" without any negative or positive adjective suggests a neutral mention, but it is contextually about the in-group's quarterback performance history. 'Bears' here is identifying the source of the quarterback, which directly ties the quarterback to the in-group team. Thus, 'Bears' should be tagged with [IN], since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The phrase "With a Bears quarterback" refers to the quarterback of the Bears, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. The rest of the sentence "you always know one's coming" implies a level of expectation associated with that in-group quarterback. Therefore, "Bears" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, making the tagging of "Bears" as [IN] appropriate.	1668977795.0	bears	falcons	Lobanium	Bears	0.0	0.029777228832244984	[5]

[SENT] [OUT] have an excuse not sure what [IN] is 	['Cowboys', 'ours']	[(85, 92), (122, 126)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	The comment is discussing the overall quality of the game, which is described as ugly. In the second sentence, the commenter compares the Cowboys, who are the out-group team, implying they have a reason for their poor performance, and contrasts this by questioning the in-group team, which is the Vikings. Given the zero percent win probability, it makes sense that the commenter is critical of their own team. 'Cowboys' refers explicitly to the out-group, so it is tagged [OUT], while 'ours' refers to the in-group team, the Vikings, thus it is tagged [IN]. The in-group team is evidently struggling, reflecting the low win probability and reinforcing the critical tone towards their own performance.	The commenter is distinguishing between the Cowboys and the Vikings in their criticism. 'Cowboys' explicitly refers to the out-group and is tagged with [OUT]. 'ours' implicitly refers to the in-group, as the commenter wonders about their own team's (the Vikings') excuses, tagging it with [IN]. The tag '[OUT]' for Cowboys and '[IN]' for 'ours' accurately reflects this distinction.	1635733309.0	vikings	cowboys	DrColours		3.0	0.0	[5, 5]

Such a term of endearment is typically reserved for players on the team that the commenter supports, which is the in-group. Since Allgeier is being praised and referred to in a positive light, it aligns with the context of supporting the in-group team (Falcons). Therefore, "ALLGEIER" should be tagged as [IN]. Despite the relatively low win probability for the in-group, which suggests the Falcons are currently not doing well, it is still consistent for fans to cheer on individual performances or moments. Hence, the tagged output and the list of referring expressions are correct.	The commenter is expressing enthusiastic support for 'ALLGEIER', who is a player for the in-group team, the Falcons. The phrase 'MY BOY' reflects a sense of pride and personal connection, which a fan would typically express towards a player on the team they support. Therefore, 'ALLGEIER' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a member of the in-group team, the Falcons.	1669581561.0	falcons	washington	SpideyM1ke		3.0	0.36971738934516896	[5]

['our', 'them']	[(13, 16), (39, 43)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The phrase "our destiny" uses "our," which indicates that the commenter is including themselves with the in-group team, the Packers. Fans typically refer to their team and themselves using "our," so "our" should be tagged as [IN]. The phrase "never have them both firing on all cylinders at once" implies that there are two elements (likely players or units of the Packers team) not performing well together. Given the context of the sentence that expresses frustration about consistency in team performance, "them" must also be referring to individuals or units within the in-group team, the Packers. Hence, "them" should be tagged as [IN] as well. The win probability being 100%, indicating the in-group has likely already won, does not change the frustration expressed about the team's performance consistency over time, making the identification of the in-group appropriate in this context.	The use of 'our' indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group team, which is the Packers in this case. The expression 'our destiny' suggests a sense of inevitability or fate concerning the in-group team's performance. The word 'them' is used to refer to members or sub-groups within the Packers, implying they are players or units within the same team. Therefore, 'our' should be tagged [IN], and 'them' should also be tagged [IN] as they both refer to entities within the in-group team.	1637529750.0	packers	vikings	Blueandigo	:4:	6.0	1.0	[5, 5]

Since Josh Johnson is a player on the Jets, he should be tagged as [OUT]. The use of 'our' in "wrecks our shit" implies the in-group (Colts), but because 'Josh Johnson' is performing the action, it is tagged as [OUT]. The high win probability (82.3%) for the in-group suggests the commenter might be worried about a rare event where an out-group player dramatically changes the game's outcome in favor of the out-group team.	Josh Johnson is a player for the Jets, the out-group team in this context. The commenter is expressing concern about this specific player impacting the game's outcome negatively for their team, the Colts. Thus, 'Josh Johnson' should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to an out-group player.	1636073771.0	colts	jets	chode_daddy	Ashton Dulin	5.0	0.823165655136108	[5]

"Our" is a possessive pronoun indicating that the commenter is talking about their own team, which is the 49ers, making "our" tagged as [IN]. The phrase "Good start" is a general statement of approval without directly specifying which team it's about but considering the win probability implies a slight advantage for the in-group, it indicates a positive sentiment probably related to the 49ers' performance, though it's not tagged since it doesn't contain an explicit reference.	Philly refers to the Philadelphia Eagles, which is the out-group team. 'our run defense' indicates ownership and refers to the in-group team, the 49ers. Therefore, 'Philly' should be tagged [OUT] and 'our' should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence 'Good start' likely refers to the performance of the in-group team, but there is no explicit reference, so the sentence itself is not tagged.	1632071506.0	49ers	eagles	bashsports	:jerseyaway08: Steve Young	9.0	0.576807856559753	[5, 5]

Thus, tagging this with [OTHER] is a safe choice, indicating the ambiguity. In the second sentence, "He did get hit as he was throwing tho," the pronoun "He" probably refers to the out-group's quarterback or another offensive player, especially given the context that the in-group has a high win probability (89.4%). While the Raiders have a high chance of winning, the commenter acknowledges that an out-group player was hit while throwing, which could be pointing out a moment of fairness or sportsmanship. Hence, "He" and "he" should be tagged as [OUT] because they refer to a specific out-group player in the current game between the Raiders and Rams.	The comment appears to be critiquing a particular decision and then making an excuse for the player who made the decision, suggesting a level of empathy or at least an attempt to explain an incident. Given that the in-group is the Raiders and the out-group is the Rams, the player who got hit and made the throw is likely from the out-group. s- The first sentence "Not a good decision" is a general comment that does not clearly refer to either the in-group or out-group; since there is no explicit reference, it could be tagged as [OTHER] as a neutral observation about the game.- In the second sentence, the commenter says, "He did get hit as he was throwing tho," which appears to refer to a specific player. Given this context, it is likely that this player is from the out-group (Rams), and thus both instances of "He" and "he" should be tagged as [OUT].	1670553106.0	raiders	rams	bproofstk		0.0	0.894481711089611	[5, 4, 4]

['Refs', 'the jets']	[(7, 11), (40, 48)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]']	The comment mentions "Refs only throwing flags against the jets today apparently," which indicates dissatisfaction with the referees perceived as biased against the Jets. The term "Refs" is not specific to either team within the game, and it could apply to referees in general, thus it's tagged as [OTHER]. "The jets" explicitly refers to the in-group team, the Jets, so it is tagged as [IN]. The win probability of 27.8% suggests the Jets are losing, which aligns with the frustration expressed by the commenter regarding penalties. Therefore, the tags are correct for identifying the entities, and "Refs" and "the jets" are appropriately tagged as [OTHER] and [IN] respectively.	The commenter is likely complaining about the referees' decision-making during the game. 'the jets' clearly refers to the in-group since the commenter supports the Jets. The word 'Refs' is tagged as [OTHER] because referees are neither part of the Jets (in-group) nor the Saints (out-group); they are a neutral entity within the sport. Thus, 'Refs' should be tagged with [OTHER] and 'the jets' with [IN].	1639335793.0	jets	saints	KingkingKingkiller		6.0	0.277524262666702	[5, 5]

The phrase 'it's disappointing' can be associated with the fan's feelings about the in-group team. In the second sentence, the phrase 'they' can be inferred to refer to the Cowboys since it follows from the context of disappointment and the desire for the team to carry over positive emotions from a previous successful performance or game. Hence, 'they' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The comment is indicative of a Cowboys supporter's frustration or disappointment, likely due to their team's performance. The use of "they" in the second sentence suggests the commenter is talking about their own team, the Cowboys, and hoping for a continuation of positive momentum from a previous game. This type of hopeful reflection and disappointment is typical for a commenter discussing their in-group team.Thus, the reference "they" should be tagged as [IN] to indicate that it refers to the Cowboys, the in-group team the commenter supports.	1641162299.0	cowboys	cardinals	jrh1972		1.0	0.366233770858981	[5]

[SENT] Lmaooo 	['Creed']	[(40, 45)]	['[IN]']	The win probability for the Chiefs is quite high, indicating that they are likely performing well in the game. "Creed" refers to Creed Humphrey, a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, the in-group team. The comment expresses affection and admiration for Creed, which aligns with the commenter being a supporter of the Chiefs. Therefore, "Creed" should be tagged [IN], as it refers to an in-group player. The second sentence "Lmaooo" does not have any explicit reference and thus does not get tagged, but it carries an implicit positive reaction that aligns with supporting the in-group.	Creed Humphrey is a player for the Kansas City Chiefs. The statement expresses love for Creed, which signifies a positive sentiment towards the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Creed' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team. The second sentence, "Lmaooo," does not contain any specific referring expression but is likely a continuation of the positive sentiment, reinforcing the in-group context.	1636943150.0	chiefs	raiders			12.0	0.804404854774475	[5]

['McVay', 'refs']	[(7, 12), (46, 50)]	['[OUT]', '[OUT]']	The commenter is discussing Sean McVay, the head coach of the Rams, hinting at his influence on referees. Given the context, 'McVay' is clearly a reference to an out-group entity, as he is the head coach of the Rams. The win probability being high for the in-group (Cardinals) might indicate that the team is doing well, and the comment may be a sarcastic way of dismissing the threat posed by McVay's tactics. 'Refs' is likely tagged as out-group because of its connection to the same context involving McVay, suggesting a perceived bias that would benefit the Rams (out-group). Therefore, 'McVay' and 'refs' should both be tagged as [OUT], and the comment implicitly refers to underhanded tactics by the Rams' coach to gain an unfair advantage.	The commenter is referencing 'McVay', who is the head coach of the Rams, the out-group team in this context. Therefore, 'McVay' should be tagged with [OUT]. The 'refs from the SuperBowl' phrase is used disparagingly, implying they favor the Rams, the out-group team. Thus, 'refs' should also be tagged with [OUT]. The overall tone suggests that these entities are perceived negatively by the in-group supporter, reinforcing the out-group tagging.	1668380429.0	cardinals	rams	TheSkullsOfEveryCog		3.0	0.885452404618263	[5, 5]

['Mac', 'opposing hoes']	[(70, 73), (97, 110)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	The win probability is relatively low, indicating that the game isn't going particularly well for the in-group, the Patriots. However, the comment focuses on a positive aspect: Mac Jones, the Patriots' quarterback, performing well ("increasingly stunts") against the opponents ("opposing hoes"). This suggests admiration for Mac Jones and a sense of triumph over the opponents, who are the Texans. The use of "Mac" clearly indicates the in-group player, Mac Jones, and "opposing hoes" derogatorily refers to out-group players, fitting within the competitive and often impassioned nature of NFL commentary.1. "Mac" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to Mac Jones of the Patriots, the team the commenter supports.2. "opposing hoes" should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group players, the Texans, whom the Patriots are playing against.Therefore, the sentence captures the in-group (Patriots) and out-group (Texans) dynamics appropriately.	The commenter refers to 'Mac,' which is likely a shorthand for Mac Jones, the quarterback of the Patriots, and uses the phrase 'increasingly stunts on opposing hoes,' which is a way of saying that Mac Jones is performing well against the opposing teams. Since Mac Jones plays for the Patriots, 'Mac' should be tagged with [IN]. The phrase 'opposing hoes' refers disparagingly to the opposing players, which, in this context, are the Texans. Therefore, 'opposing hoes' should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the opponent team players. The rest of the sentence doesn't explicitly refer to any team or players, so it doesn't need additional tagging.	1633892939.0	patriots	texans	HugeSuccess		1.0	0.42819705605506897	[5, 5]

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	Despite the moderate win probability for the Broncos, the commenter appears to be expressing frustration with their team's offensive performance by noting that they are 'Averaging less than 1 TD a game.' This is likely a critical comment about the in-group (Broncos) because fans are generally concerned with their own team's lack of scoring. There is no direct reference to any players, so '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN] to represent the implicit criticism of the in-group team. The 'Ugh.' in the second sentence further expresses the commenter's disappointment, making it reasonable to associate the frustration with the in-group's performance. Given the context of the game and typical fan behavior, it is reasonable to assume that the dissatisfaction described is directed toward the in-group's performance.Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' for the first sentence, and there's no explicit referring expression in the comment, making 'Ugh.' a general exclamation of frustration that doesn't require additional tagging.	The comment expresses frustration about averaging less than one touchdown per game, indicative of poor performance. A fan is more likely to complain about their own team's shortcomings, especially in a frustrated tone like "Ugh". There is an implicit reference to the in-group team (the Broncos), as the commenter is implicitly upset about their in-group team's performance and no explicit reference to the opposing team (the Chargers). Thus, the entire statement implicitly refers to the in-group team, so '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN], since it represents the in-group team the commenter supports.	1666062362.0	broncos	chargers	LionelHutz88	:CWxQy4O:	5.0	0.274134516716003	[5]

The commenter is asking about people who were critical of Mac Jones, implying a defense or challenge towards those critics. This is a common in-group behavior where fans defend their own players against criticism. Despite the relatively low win probability, the commenter's focus remains on defending an in-group player. Hence, "mac" should be tagged with [IN], as it pertains to the commenter's team.	The comment is addressing 'mac haters', likely referring to Mac Jones, who is a player for the Patriots. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Patriots, the term 'mac' should be tagged with [IN], as it refers to an in-group player.

"reich" refers to Frank Reich, who is the head coach of the Colts, so "reich" should also be tagged [IN]. The comment is expressing frustration about potentially losing the game and blaming it on the play calling of their team's coach, further confirming that the commenter is referring to the Colts. Thus, "we" and "reich" are correctly tagged as [IN] because they refer to the in-group team, the Colts.	The commenter uses "we" to refer to the in-group, which is the Colts, as fans commonly use "we" to show their identification with their team. Reich is the head coach of the Colts, and any mention of him in the context of play calling would also refer to the in-group team. Thus, 'we' and 'reich' should be tagged with [IN].	1667171409.0	colts	washington	YungAvocadoDaGawd84	Future HOF Bobby Okereke	1.0	0.500636130571365	[5, 5]

The comment mentions the "Vikings," who are neither the in-group (Lions) nor the out-group (Bears). Therefore, "Vikings" should be tagged as [OTHER] because they refer to another team in the NFL, not involved in the current game between the Lions and Bears. The comment does not mention the in-group or out-group directly but focuses on another game entirely. Hence, "Vikings" is correctly identified and tagged as [OTHER].	The in-group team is the Lions and the out-group team is the Bears. The comment refers to a game involving the Vikings, which is neither the in-group (Lions) nor the out-group (Bears).

Additionally, the phrase 'Packers FO' (Front Office) refers to the administrative segment of the Packers organization, so it should also be tagged as [IN]. The low win probability for the in-group reinforces the negative sentiment about the team expressed by the commenter. Thus both 'Joe Barry' and 'Packers FO' refer to the in-group and are correctly tagged as [IN].	The commenter mentions being "sick of the Joe Barry experiment" and criticism towards the "Packers FO" (Front Office). Joe Barry is an entity associated with the in-group team (Packers), as he is their defensive coordinator, and "Packers FO" refers to the Packers' Front Office, which is part of the organizational structure of the in-group team. The frustrated tone of the comment indicates dissatisfaction with the in-group team's management decisions. Therefore, "Joe Barry" and "Packers FO" are correctly tagged as [IN].	1631481862.0	packers	saints			6.0	0.18349471212692203	[5, 5]

['Jim Tomsula']	[(19, 30)]	['[OTHER]']	Jim Tomsula is neither associated with the Cardinals (in-group) nor the Rams (out-group) in this context but is a coach who has been associated with other teams in the NFL, notably the 49ers and NFL Europe league. The comment does not reference the current game or any players/coaches from either the in-group or out-group team. Hence, mentioning Jim Tomsula is unrelated to the Cardinals or Rams and should be tagged as [OTHER]. The win probability being extremely low for the in-group might indicate that the commenter is already thinking beyond the game and about other football contexts, supporting the idea that Jim Tomsula is just being mentioned as part of a general football topic, not tied to the current in-group or out-group teams.	Jim Tomsula is not a player or coach associated with either the Cardinals (the in-group) or the Rams (the out-group). He has been a head coach and an assistant coach for other NFL teams, but none directly related to the in-group or the out-group.

'Colts' is clearly the out-group as it directly refers to the opponent team. The phrase 'aren't they' also refers back to the Colts, emphasizing the belief that the Colts are going to score. Despite the high win probability for the in-group (Titans), the commenter is expressing concern about the Colts' potential to score, thus both 'Colts' and 'they' should be tagged as [OUT].	The commenter is concerned that the Colts, the out-group team, will score a touchdown and a 2-point conversion. The terms 'Colts' and 'they' both refer to the out-group team. Therefore, 'Colts' and 'they' should be tagged as [OUT], since they refer to the out-group opponent team.	1664739375.0	titans	colts	shittyfingers	:JRob:	5.0	0.810832142829895	[5, 5]

[IN] Fucking idiots 	['Sanders', '[SENT]']	[(33, 40), (43, 49)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is likely criticizing the in-group team (Eagles) for not utilizing their player, Sanders, suggesting that continuing to use Sanders would have been a better strategy. 'Sanders' is therefore tagged as [IN] because he is a player for the Eagles, the in-group team. In the second sentence, the derogatory phrase 'Fucking idiots' is assumed to be directed at the in-group team for their decision-making, as fans typically criticize their own team using such strong language. As this sentence lacks an explicit reference to the in-group, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN].	The commenter is complaining about strategic decisions, which is something fans do about their own team. Sanders is a player for the Eagles, indicating the first sentence is about the in-group. The second sentence, although not mentioning a specific entity, conveys frustration typically directed at the in-group for poor management or play-calling. Therefore, 'Sanders' should be tagged with [IN], and the second sentence [SENT] should also be tagged with [IN], as it implicitly refers to the in-group's coaching or management.	1671924779.0	eagles	cowboys	Domestic_AA_Battery	Santa isn't real 	13.0	0.455376038451591	[5, 5]

The exclamation "bro" and the lack of pressure suggest disappointment with their own team's performance rather than a comment on the opponent. Given the context, the sentence is implicitly about the Seahawks' defense not applying enough pressure on the Raiders' offense, despite not explicitly mentioning the Seahawks. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team's lack of defensive pressure.	The comment is expressing frustration over a lack of pressure, which likely refers to the performance of the in-group's defensive line. Fans typically voice such concerns about their own team rather than the opponent. Since the comment lacks explicit references to specific entities, it implicitly pertains to the in-group (Seahawks). Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to indicate that the complaint is about the in-group team, and there are no explicit referring expressions in the sentence.	1669595241.0	seahawks	raiders	electricmnky	:sea1:​	6.0	0.334767246735282	[5]

[SENT] At least [IN] looks to be heating up . 	['[SENT]', 'the D']	[(23, 29), (60, 65)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	The comment contains both frustration and a bit of optimism, and contextually, the win probability is low for the Buccaneers, indicating they are trailing at this point. The phrase 'Damn it, man!' expresses frustration and doesn't refer directly to either team, hence the [SENT] tag without an entity-specific label. 'Lucky break' is more likely to refer to the opposing team (the Packers) catching a break because the commenter, being a Bucs fan, would likely blame the opponent's luck for negative events affecting their team. Thus it is tagged as [OUT]. The final sentence, 'At least the D looks to be heating up', appears to find a positive in the Buccaneers' defensive performance ('the D') amid the overall negative situation, thus tagging it as [IN] is appropriate.	The first sentence, "Damn it, man!" is an expression of frustration without a clear referring expression, and it's reasonable to associate it with the out-group's success or the in-group's failure, given the typical fan-based commentary. The second sentence, "Lucky break," is likely referring to a favorable, potentially fortuitous event for the out-group, so it's tagged as [OUT]. The third sentence, "At least the D looks to be heating up," indicates a positive observation about the defense, presumably referring to the in-group's defense improving. Therefore, "the D" is tagged with [IN].	1664139559.0	buccaneers	packers	zoanthidcoral	:o20: Ronde Barber	2.0	0.29914253950119	[5, 5]

This context commonly stems from fans critiquing their own team rather than giving a balanced assessment of both teams' units, especially when the win probability is relatively low, indicating frustration. Thus, both 'O' and 'D' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group team, the Eagles.	The commenter is referring to the performance of their own team's offense and defense. The phrase "Unpopular opinion but" suggests that the commenter is offering a critical view of their in-group team. The criticism is aimed at the performance disparity between the offense ('O') and the defense ('D'). Since the commenter is supporting the Eagles and is providing an opinion on their team's performance, 'O' and 'D' should both be tagged as [IN]. Thus, 'O' and 'D' in the comment are referring to units within the in-group team, the Eagles.	1641151299.0	eagles	washington	tractor_pull		-1.0	0.34014704823494	[5, 5]

Consequently, 'the Cowboys' is tagged [IN]. The complaint is based on the notion that the NFL prefers certain teams and players, specifically mentioning a Superbowl matchup between the 'Bucs', 'Chiefs', and 'Tom Brady'. As these teams and the player mentioned are neither the in-group (Cowboys) nor the out-group (Cardinals) within this specific matchup, they should be tagged [OTHER]. Therefore, 'Bucs', 'Chiefs', and 'Tom Brady' are rightfully assigned [OTHER], with the target output correctly reflecting the perceived bias in favor of other high-profile teams and players.	The commenter is frustrated with the NFL and believes there is a bias against the Cowboys, which is clearly indicated by the phrase "the Cowboys," referring to the in-group. The mention of a "Bucs v Chiefs Superbowl" and "Tom Brady" refers to other teams and players in the NFL that are not the ongoing opponent, thus they should be tagged as [OTHER].

The comment expresses a strong negative sentiment towards Harris, which suggests that Harris is a player from the in-group team. Fans often express such frustration towards their own team's players when the team is losing or performing poorly. Therefore, "Harris" should be tagged as [IN] because he is being referred to as an unwanted player on the commenter's own team, the Chargers.	The comment is expressing dissatisfaction with Harris, indicating a desire not to see him play again. This is typically something a fan would say about a player from the team they support (the in-group) when they are disappointed or frustrated with that player's performance. Since the commenter supports the Chargers, 'Harris' refers to a member of the Chargers, and thus should be tagged with [IN].	1641786732.0	chargers	raiders			5.0	0.14212579017132498	[5]

The pronoun 'them' is used to refer to the opponent since the commenter is a Chiefs fan and the opponent is the Steelers. The win probability is 100% for the Chiefs, indicating they are performing extremely well, solidifying that 'them' refers to the out-group team. Hence, 'them' is correctly tagged as [OUT].	The commenter is urging their team (the Chiefs) to keep the other team (the Steelers) out of the end zone. The word 'them' here refers to the out-group opponent, the Steelers. Fans typically use 'them' to refer to the opposing team in such contexts. Therefore, 'them' should be tagged with [OUT].	1642392197.0	chiefs	steelers	Chief_Peej		4.0	0.999653220176697	[3]

['they', 'The Bears', 'Houston']	[(99, 103), (138, 147), (184, 191)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]', '[OTHER]']	The comment sequence reflects a mix of praising the in-group and acknowledging the opponent team's current standing. The explanation for the targeting and tagging is as follows:1. **Sentence 3** - "Settle down, they had a good showing today.": The 'they' here is referring to the in-group team, the Packers, since the comment is reflective of the high win probability (99.6%) and the fact that the commenter is urging for calmness and acknowledging a good performance by the in-group team. Consequently, 'they' should be tagged as [IN].2. **Sentence 4** - "The Bears are 3 - 2, not like we're playing Houston or something.":     - "The Bears" is the out-group team, and hence is tagged [OUT].    - "Houston" refers to a different team in the NFL, the Houston Texans, which is neither the in-group nor the out-group in this context. Therefore, it is tagged [OTHER].    To summarize:- 'they' is referring to the in-group, hence tagged [IN].- "The Bears" is referring to the out-group, hence tagged [OUT].- "Houston" is referring to another team not involved in this match	The comment appears to be defending the performance of the in-group team while discussing the relative strength of the out-group and other teams. 1. The phrase "they had a good showing today" implies that the commenter is defending the performance of the in-group team. The mention of "they" in this context refers to the Packers, who are being praised, indicating that "they" should be tagged as [IN]. 2. The fourth sentence states that "The Bears are 3-2", which is a clear reference to the out-group team. Thus, "The Bears" is tagged [OUT]. 3. The phrase "not like we're playing Houston or something" is comparing the level of difficulty faced. "Houston" here refers to another team in the NFL, not involved in the current game but used for comparison, and thus should be tagged [OTHER].The explanation for why 'they', 'The Bears', and 'Houston' are correctly tagged as referring expressions with [IN], [OUT], and [OTHER] respectively is as follows:The word "they" in "they had a good showing today" refers to the in-group team, the Packers, as the commenter is defending their performance.

['him', '[SENT]', 'Byron']	[(33, 36), (107, 113), (147, 152)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment is expressing frustration with the team's coaching staff, specifically with Byron, who is a coach for the Buccaneers. When commenters use terms that do not explicitly name individuals but refer to performance issues, it is often the case that they are talking about their own team, especially when the comment is negative or critical. In this case, 'him' refers to Byron, a known figure associated with the Buccaneers, so it is tagged [IN]. 'What the fuck' is a general exclamatory statement often used by fans of the in-group when frustrated with their own team's performance, so '[SENT]' is tagged [IN]. Lastly, 'Byron' is referring to Byron Leftwich, the Buccaneers' offensive coordinator, so it too should be tagged [IN]. The combined win probability and critical tone support the idea that the commenter is focusing on their in-group's coaching strategy failures.	The commenter is expressing frustration and disbelief, which, given the context, is likely directed towards the in-group team, the Buccaneers. 'Him' in the first sentence refers to Byron, which is a nickname or a shorthand for someone (likely Byron Leftwich, the Buccaneers' offensive coordinator). Thus, 'him' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group member. The second sentence ('What the fuck') is an expression of frustration that is continuous from the first sentence, hence it should also be tagged as [IN]. In the third sentence, 'Byron' refers to Byron Leftwich again, indicating ongoing criticism of the in-group team. Therefore, 'Byron' should also be tagged as [IN].	1667774333.0	buccaneers	rams	Lil_LempelZiv	:alstottjersey: Alstott Jersey	10.0	0.462972939014435	[4, 5, 4]

Given that the in-group is the Bears, the commenter is likely referring to a key player on the Bears' team, especially since the win probability is relatively low, indicating they might be looking toward an individual to change the game. Therefore, the sentence should be implicitly tagged with [IN], and there are no specific words or phrases that need tagging, so '[SENT]' is correctly tagged with '[IN]' to signify the implicit reference to the in-group.	The commenter is excitedly referencing a positive aspect of their own team, indicated by the phrase "YOUR SAVIOR OF THE FRANCHISE." This type of enthusiastic praise is typical for in-group supporters celebrating a key player or a crucial moment. The lack of a specific noun or phrase means there isn't an explicit referring expression to tag, but the sentiment clearly applies to the in-group team, the Bears. Therefore, the '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because the comment implicitly refers to a positive moment for the in-group team.	1635708816.0	bears	49ers	godly_mercs	1	1.0	0.2968430519104	[5]

The statement "We are the kings of New York and New Jersey" is suggesting that the Bills are superior within the regions of New York and New Jersey. Since the game is against the Jets, which is a team from New York/New Jersey, the references to "New York" and "New Jersey" are implicitly about the Jets, the out-group opponent. Therefore, "New York" and "New Jersey" should be tagged as [OUT]. The high win probability implies the Bills are nearly certain to win, reinforcing the boastful tone of the comment. While "We" typically refers to the in-group, in this context it is not explicitly tagged because the focus of the tags is on "New York" and "New Jersey."	The phrase "We are the kings of New York and New Jersey" expresses the idea that the in-group (Bills) dominates the region. However, when tagging cities, they should be tagged with the corresponding out-group label if they are the home regions of the out-group team. In this context, both New York and New Jersey are associated with the out-group team, the Jets. Hence, '[New York]' and '[New Jersey]' are tagged as [OUT] since they refer to the territories the Jets are often associated with, even though the commenter is implying dominance over them.	1636920076.0	bills	jets	Letsgobuffalo2210	:hamlin:	2.0	0.9940687417984009	[5, 5]

The exclamation of frustration with the angry emojis suggests the commenter is either emphasizing a rare positive in an otherwise bad situation (as indicated by the very low win probability) or being sarcastic about the current performance to express disappointment. Regardless, Slay is being referred to as an in-group player, so he is tagged [IN].	The commenter is praising a player named 'Slay', calling him a "lockdown CB" which is a positive comment. This kind of praise is typically directed towards an in-group player rather than an out-group player. Since 'Slay' is a player for the Eagles, which is the in-group team supported by the commenter, 'Slay' should be tagged as [IN]. The strong positive reaction with the emoticons further indicates that this is a supportive comment towards an in-group entity.	1632797374.0	eagles	cowboys	AgentFernandez		2.0	0.008891448112785971	[5]

['We', 'We', 'we']	[(7, 9), (55, 57), (89, 91)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is a supporter of the Raiders, as indicated by the high win probability of 92.4%, suggesting they are likely winning. The continuous use of "We" indicates a personal identification with the team, common among fans discussing their own team's performance. The comment expresses confidence and satisfaction with the Raiders' efforts and expected outcome. Therefore, "We" in the first sentence should be tagged [IN] because the commenter is referring to the in-group team, the Raiders. Similarly, "We" in the second sentence and "we" in the phrase "what we wanted" should also be tagged [IN], as they both refer to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter's use of "We" in both sentences indicates their support for the in-group team, the Raiders. Fans generally use "We" to refer to their own team, showing a collective sense of identity and investment in the outcome of the game. The comment reflects an optimistic perspective about their team's performance and efforts, as well as confidence in winning, which they would only express regarding the in-group team. Thus, "We" and "we" in both sentences should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1641789108.0	raiders	chargers	grumpysky	:Logo_95-Present:	2.0	0.923849061131477	[5, 5, 5]

['Refs']	[(7, 11)]	['[OTHER]']	In this comment, the commenter is talking about the referees' performance. The term 'Refs' refers to the referees in the game, who are neutral officials and not associated with either the in-group (49ers) or the out-group (Rams). Therefore, 'Refs' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The second sentence appears to comment on the fairness of the calls, which is related to the referees but does not introduce new referring expressions. Hence, 'Refs' is the only explicitly tagged term with [OTHER] in this case.	When referring to "Refs," the commenter is talking about the referees, who are neutral officials and not part of either the in-group (49ers) or out-group (Rams) teams. Therefore, "Refs" should be tagged as [OTHER]. The rest of the sentences don't contain explicit mentions of the in-group or out-group teams, nor do they indicate specific actions directly attributable to either, so they remain untagged outside of the 'Refs'. Hence, the tagging and list of referring expressions are correct.	1643592457.0	49ers	rams	Accomplished_Yard984	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	3.0	0.573770225048065	[5]

The phrase "does it again" indicates a recurring positive action by Kerby, creating the sense that the commenter is somewhat impressed or supportive of this player's efforts, despite the low win probability. The mention of "of course there's a flag" appears to express frustration at a penalty, but this does not change the identification of Kerby as an in-group reference. Therefore, 'Kerby' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a player on the team that the commenter supports.	The commenter uses 'Kerby', which likely refers to Kerby Joseph, a player for the Detroit Lions (in-group team). The expression 'does it again' suggests a positive action, likely meaning a significant play or contribution by Kerby Joseph. Fans typically highlight positive actions by players from the team they support. Given this context, 'Kerby' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. The rest of the sentence does not explicitly mention the out-group, so no further tags are needed.	1673235548.0	lions	packers	spydrwebb44		5.0	0.25264835357666005	[5]

[IN] A wins a win 	['ref', '[SENT]']	[(28, 31), (58, 64)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]']	The first sentence mentions wanting a referee job, which is in reference to NFL referees, commonly seen as neutral parties, thus 'ref' should be tagged as [OTHER] to denote it is not part of either the in-group or out-group teams. The second sentence appears to take pride in a win, suggesting it relates to the in-group team, even if the win probability is low at the moment. Therefore, the whole second sentence should be tagged [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group, the Dolphins.	The commenter sarcastically mentions taking a "ref job," implying dissatisfaction with the referees. Referees are neither part of the in-group nor the out-group but are neutral officials, so "ref" should be tagged as [OTHER]. In the second sentence, the commenter is happy about their team winning ("A wins a win"), indicating that this comment refers to the in-group team. Since there is no explicit mention of the in-group team, the [SENT] token is tagged as [IN] to indicate this implicit reference.	1635704430.0	dolphins	bills	zp57		0.0	0.347561836242676	[5, 5]

['we', 'We']	[(15, 17), (73, 75)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter uses "we" and "We" to describe the team's performance, which is a common way for fans to refer to the in-group team they support. Despite the high win probability indicating the in-group Bills are likely to win, the commenter seems to be providing reasons for their success (being ahead in stats like yards, plays, and possession) and acknowledging that they've had some lucky breaks. This language shows a sense of identification with the team, justifying tagging both instances of "we" and "We" with [IN] as they clearly refer to the in-group Bills.	The word 'we' and its capitalized form 'We' both refer to the in-group team, the Bills. The complaint about being ahead in key metrics like yards, plays, and time of possession but attributing their success to lucky turnovers and fourth down holds is framed from the perspective of a Bills supporter, who uses 'we' to describe their team's performance. Therefore, 'we' and 'We' are tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group.	1632075941.0	bills	dolphins	RedNeckBillBob	:still-bill:	1.0	0.9301313906908035	[5, 5]

['We', 'we']	[(40, 42), (53, 55)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is discussing a hypothetical scenario involving Russell Wilson (Russ), who was a key player for the Seahawks. 'We' in this context is likely referring to the in-group (Seahawks) fans, as it is common for fans to speak as part of their team. The phrase 'we don't care about winning' suggests dissatisfaction with the potential move of a major player, which directly involves the fans' in-group team. Given that 'we' and 'We' are both referring to the Seahawks (the team the commenter supports), they are correctly tagged as [IN]. The win probability of 10.2% also implies that the team is not performing well, which adds context to the sentiment of the comment regarding a critical player move and team performance.	The phrase "We move Russ we don't care about winning" clearly implies that the commenter is talking about their own team trading Russell Wilson, a significant player for the Seahawks. When the commenter says "we," it typically refers to the team they support. Given this context, "We" and "we" should be tagged as [IN], as it is indicative of the commenter's in-group team, the Seahawks. The sentence "Moves ? For sure." is a general comment and does not explicitly refer to any group. Therefore, the tags for this sentence are left as is.	1634522931.0	seahawks	steelers	HeyEverythingIsFine	​	1.0	0.10188751667738005	[5, 5]

This is supported by the win probability being 0.0%, indicating the in-group is losing badly. The comment is mainly about the in-group, the Packers, and their struggle and partial success despite certain weaknesses like a poor offensive line ('the o-line'). 1. 'the o-line' refers to the Packers' offensive line, which is being criticized and is thus tagged [IN].2. 'he' refers to the in-group QB who seemingly outperformed the other team's QB yet still lost, so should be tagged [IN] since the focus is on the in-group player's performance.3. 'the opposing QB' clearly denotes a player from the out-group, hence tagged [OUT].4. 'his' in the larger sense criticizes the narrative that the in-group QB is to blame for the loss, implying it is the in-group QB's fault, and thus tagged [IN]. Thus, in all three parts of the comment, the emphasis is on criticizing or defending the in-group team's performance, with specific references to both the in-group and the out-group, making the tags appropriate as specified.`	The commenter appears to be frustrated with the performance of the team they support, the Packers. The first sentence mentions the "o-line" which is often a point of criticism for fans regarding their own team's performance, thus it is tagged [IN]. The second sentence suggests that a player (likely the Packers' quarterback) outperformed the opponent's QB (the Jets' QB) but still lost, indicating a discussion about an in-group player ("he") outperforming an out-group player ("the opposing QB"), thus "he" and "the opposing QB" are tagged [IN] and [OUT] respectively. The final sentence sarcastically blames the in-group player for the loss, marking "his" as [IN].	1665951498.0	packers	jets	TurboS54		0.0	0.0	[5, 5, 5, 5]

The high win probability indicates that the Ravens are doing well overall, but the commenter seems concerned about the presence or performance of this specific Ravens player in this instance. Fans typically show concern about the performance or absence of their own players rather than those on the opposing team. Therefore, "Marlo" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	'Marlo' likely refers to Marlon Humphrey, a well-known player for the Ravens. The commenter is asking for his presence, implying interest and concern specific to a player on their supported team, the Ravens.

The phrase 'Doesn't trust the offense to gain two yards' criticizes the capabilities of the offense, which is implicitly referring to the in-group team as well. Despite the high win probability, which suggests the in-group team is doing well overall, the commenter focuses on a specific moment where the team's strategy was questioned. Therefore, both 'Kyle' and 'the offense' are correctly tagged as [IN].	The comment appears to criticize someone named Kyle, along with a negative remark about not trusting 'the offense.' Given the context, 'Kyle' likely refers to Kyle Shanahan, the head coach of the 49ers, which is the in-group team supported by the commenter. Furthermore, 'the offense' also refers to the 49ers' offensive unit. Since both 'Kyle' and 'the offense' pertain to the in-group, they should be tagged with [IN]. The negative sentiment ('coward shit' and 'Doesn't trust the offense') indicates frustration with the in-group, confirming the association. Thus, 'Kyle' and 'the offense' are correctly tagged as [IN].	1668390231.0	49ers	chargers	pinesolthrowaway	:jerseyaway74: Joe Staley	5.0	0.705707788467407	[5, 5]

Therefore, "Flock Fam" should be tagged as [IN]. The last sentence "[SENT] Let 's go shock the nation !" implies a collective motive and support for the in-group team, even though no team-specific word is mentioned. This sentence should be tagged with [IN] as it implicitly refers to the in-group team, indicating a rallying cry for the Ravens.	The term 'Flock Fam' is referring to a community of Ravens supporters, indicating that "Thanks Flock Fam" is expressing gratitude to fellow in-group members. Therefore, 'Flock Fam' should be tagged as [IN]. In the last sentence "Let's go shock the nation!", the commenter is rallying support for the in-group team, hinting at an implicit reference to the Ravens. Since there is no explicit phrase that directly names the in-group, the [SENT] token should be tagged as [IN] to reflect this context.	1673831596.0	ravens	bengals	Moonpile	 :BAL: 	9.0	0.736337780952454	[5, 5]

It is a neutral mention, without it being related to either the in-group or the out-group in context. Thus, "Trubisky" should be tagged as [OTHER], since he is associated with a different team in the NFL, and does not play for the Packers or the Chiefs. The low win probability of the Packers does not change the fact that this comment does not involve the in-group or out-group directly. Therefore, "Trubisky" is tagged [OTHER].	The Packers are the in-group, and the Chiefs are the out-group according to the provided input. Trubisky is a player for the Chicago Bears, which is neither the in-group (Packers) nor the out-group (Chiefs) in this context. Therefore, 'Trubisky' should be tagged with [OTHER] as it refers to another team in the NFL that is not involved in this specific game.	1636330263.0	packers	chiefs	skolkings1		3.0	0.03969243913888898	[5]

The in-group team is the Jets, evidenced by the term 'BOYS,' which fans frequently use to refer to their own team players. Therefore, 'BOYS' should be tagged as [IN] since it is a supportive and motivational address intended for the in-group.	The commenter is clearly expressing a desire for their team to score, which indicates support for the in-group. The term 'BOYS' is often an affectionate or motivating term used by fans to refer to their own team. Thus, 'BOYS' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, which is the Jets in this case.	1668972158.0	jets	patriots	NtoDyslixec	:OtherJamesGandolfini: 	3.0	0.405218183994293	[5]

The phrase "Solid win !!!!!" is a celebratory comment, which a fan would make about their own team. Therefore, the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group, the 49ers. Since there is no explicit mention of the in-group in the sentence, the sentence itself is tagged as referring to the in-group ([IN]).	The commenter expresses positive sentiment about a "Solid win," which usually indicates they are celebrating a victory by their favored team. Since the commenter supports the 49ers, the sentence is about the in-group team, even though no specific words or phrases directly refer to the 49ers. Thus, the entire sentence should be tagged [IN], making '[SENT]' the correct referring expression for the in-group.	1639958302.0	49ers	falcons	gbassman5	:jerseyaway20: Garrison Hearst	2.0	1.0	[5]

Given the rest of the sentences discuss motivation and rooting for "him," it implies a player on the in-group team. This conclusion comes from the phrasing that fans typically use when discussing players on teams they support, especially when the comment is positive overall. The use of "I'll be rooting for him" further strengthens that "he" in the context is a player from the in-group team. The win probability being low suggests the team is not doing well, yet the commenter is looking to the future, discussing motivations and supporting their player. Consequently, the words "he" and both instances of "him" are referring to an in-group player and should be tagged [IN] accordingly.	The commenter is talking about a player who will be in a contract year next season, and it is someone whom they will be rooting for, which implies a sense of support and in-group affiliation. The use of "I'll be rooting for him" indicates that this player is someone whom the commenter supports, which aligns with the in-group team Rams. The statement "Won't be drafting him in fantasy tho haha" is a casual mention that further personalizes the connection to this player as part of the in-group. Therefore, 'he', 'him', and 'him' should all be tagged [IN] as they are referring to a player in the in-group team (Rams) the commenter supports.	1671501236.0	rams	packers	Rough_Huckleberry333	Torry Holt	1.0	0.21720516681671098	[5, 5, 5]

'Harris' is Najee Harris, a player for the Steelers, which is the in-group team for the commenter. Hence, Harris should be tagged [IN].- 'The defenders' are described as the players who are making a particular defensive move. While it might not be clear at first, the comment states they are not even biting on the Steelers' receivers, which makes it evident that they are defenders from the opposing team, the Packers (out-group). Thus 'the defenders' should be tagged [OUT].- 'The receivers' refers to the in-group (Steelers) receivers, as they are the ones the defenders are supposed to cover. Therefore, 'the receivers' should be tagged [IN].- 'Big Ben' refers to Ben Roethlisberger, the quarterback for the Steelers (in-group team). Thus, 'Big Ben' should be tagged [IN].The explanation aligns with the contextual understanding of American football and the specific situation described in the comment. hedi7rz,The commenter is expressing a belief that 'DPJ', which refers to Donovan Peoples-Jones, a player for the Browns, will become their WR1 (Wide Receiver 1), thereby showing support and confidence in his future performance. This indicates that 'DPJ' should be tagged as [IN] since he is a player for the in-group team Browns. The use of 'our' further emphasizes that the team the commenter supports is the Browns, so 'our' should be tagged [IN] as well. The win probability of 64.3% suggests that the in-group is likely performing well at this point in the game, fitting the positive outlook in the comment. The second sentence, "You heard it here first," is a standalone expression with no direct reference to either team, and thus does not require any additional tagging.	The commenter is discussing specific players from both the in-group and out-group teams in a critique of a play's defensive and offensive actions. 'Harris' and 'Big Ben' (Ben Roethlisberger) are players for the Steelers, hence they should be tagged as [IN]. When the commenter mentions 'the defenders' who are not responding appropriately, they are referring to the defensive players of the Packers, thus it should be tagged [OUT]. 'the receivers' are part of the in-group's offensive lineup that the defenders are failing to cover, so it should be tagged as [IN]. Therefore, the entities 'Harris' and 'Big Ben' are correctly tagged [IN], 'the defenders' are tagged [OUT], and 'the receivers' are tagged [IN] in the context of the Steelers' offense against the Packers' defense.	1633299586.0	steelers	packers	keji_goto	Quack	2.0	0.10053084045648597	[5, 5, 5, 5]

While such comments could pertain to calls against either team, the high win probability (85.5%) for the in-group Panthers suggests they are likely leading and performing well. This makes it less likely that the comment refers to a call negatively affecting the Panthers. Instead, it is reasonable to assume the comment is about a call that might negatively impact another team or is seen as unjust in a broader context. Given the ambiguity and lack of specific references to the Panthers or Texans, tagging the sentence as [OTHER] is appropriate. The sentence itself does not clearly indicate the in-group or out-group, hence the '[SENT]' is tagged as [OTHER].	The comment 'What a bullshit call' does not specifically refer to either the in-group (Panthers) or the out-group (Texans) directly by name, player, or clear context that separates the teams. Since the nature of a 'bullshit call' can potentially be aimed at any team without additional context, it is safer to tag this as [OTHER]. In this instance, '[SENT]' should be tagged as [OTHER] to indicate the lack of specific reference to either the in-group or out-group.	1632445944.0	panthers	texans	Vaadwaur		2.0	0.855393320322037	[4]

"Stephons" refers to Stefon Diggs' brother, Trevon Diggs, who is a player for the Cowboys, the out-group team. However, the absence of "JJ" is critical for the Vikings, reflected in the 0.0% win probability, indicating they have lost or are about to lose. The mention of "Stephons" can be misunderstood directly as out-group, but it should instead be inferred as another team contextually. Trevon plays for another team making him the related entity from another team. Hence, "JJ" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a Vikings player, while "Stephons" should be tagged as [OTHER] since it is referring to a player from another team like the Bills since Stefon Diggs plays for the Bills, not the Cowboys.	The commenter is likely referring to Stephon Diggs, a player for the Bills, who is not part of either the Vikings or the Cowboys. Therefore, 'Stephons' should be tagged as [OTHER]. 'JJ' refers to Justin Jefferson, a player for the Vikings, making 'JJ' an in-group reference.	1635732289.0	vikings	cowboys	LBJBROW		1.0	0.0	[3, 4]

The word "him" likely refers to a player currently on the Dolphins (in-group), suggesting concern about him potentially leaving, so "him" is tagged [IN]. The commenter then mentions "dallas" and "new england," which are the Cowboys and Patriots respectively—teams that are neither the Dolphins nor the Ravens. Therefore, both "dallas" and "new england" should be tagged [OTHER].	This comment is about the Dolphins potentially losing a player to another team. 'miami' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. The word 'him' refers to a player on the in-group team. 'dallas' and 'new england' refer to other teams in the NFL, not the opponent team (Ravens), so they should be tagged as [OTHER]. Hence 'miami' and 'him' are tagged with [IN], whereas 'dallas' and 'new england' are tagged with [OTHER].	1636682928.0	dolphins	ravens	baudelairean		1.0	0.238276541233063	[5, 5, 5, 5]

Given the use of 'we', it is clear that the commenter is referring to their in-group team, the Patriots. This is a common way fans refer to their own team, showing affiliation and frustration. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team. Despite the win probability being relatively balanced, the comment's focus on the team's shortcomings during halftime means 'we' signifies the Patriots.	The use of 'we' suggests the commenter is discussing their own team, which in this context is the in-group team. The complaint about missing plays for dramatic music is something a fan would express concerning their in-group team, as they care about their team's performance and viewing experience. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN], as it implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Patriots.	1636310998.0	patriots	panthers			8.0	0.520903944969177	[5]

['ref']	[(49, 52)]	['[OTHER]']	The comment refers to a perceived unfair action by the referees, who are considered neutral parties in a game and not associated with either the in-group or out-group team in this context. NFL referees officiate games for all teams, hence they are not considered part of the in-group (Bengals) or out-group (Chiefs). Therefore, the term 'ref' should be tagged as [OTHER] since it denotes an entity that is neither part of the in-group nor the out-group but rather an external, neutral party.	The term "ref" refers to the referee, who is not associated with either the in-group (Bengals) or out-group (Chiefs) team, but instead serves as a neutral authority overseeing the game. Thus, "ref" should be tagged as [OTHER] since referees are part of the officiating crew that applies to all games in the NFL and are not specific to any team involved in this specific game. The commenter, expressing frustration with a referee decision, sees the refs as separate from the competing teams, attributing the alleged unfairness to them.	1675046577.0	bengals	chiefs	choconut5		14.0	0.387135028839111	[5]

Given the low win probability, the commenter seems to be expressing frustration with the performance of the team and, by extension, its coaching staff. There is an implicit critique in the statement "what a damn shame," which further supports the notion that the commenter's discontent is directed toward the in-group team. Hence, "byron leftwich" should be tagged [IN] since he is part of the in-group, the Buccaneers.	Byron Leftwich is the offensive coordinator for the Buccaneers. The comment likely expresses frustration aimed at their own team's coaching staff, which suggests the commenter supports the Buccaneers. Therefore, 'byron leftwich' should be tagged as [IN], referring to a member of the in-group. The '[SENT]' tokens in the second sentence do not have explicit entities but continue the sentiment related to the in-group.	1664146718.0	buccaneers	packers	PowerfulForce_		2.0	0.0935675799846649	[5]

Dennis Allen was indeed a coach for the Raiders, hinting that any mention of him here would relate to the in-group. The phrase "re-hired Dennis Allen" and "he put on 135 lbs of crayon bulk" are indicative of an internal critique, common for a supporter discussing their own team. Therefore, "we" implies the Raiders, "Dennis Allen" refers to a figure associated with the in-group, and "he" continues the reference to Dennis Allen. As such, it is appropriate that "we", "Dennis Allen", and "he" be tagged as [IN].	The comment is discussing the decision to re-hire Dennis Allen, which the commenter attributes to their own team's questionable choices. 'we' is referring to the in-group team the commenter supports. 'Dennis Allen' and 'he' refer to the same individual, who must be a coach or player for the in-group team (Raiders) since this re-hiring is being disparaged by the commenter. Thus, all tagged words refer to the in-group, making the tags [IN].	1671407081.0	raiders	patriots	gildakid		6.0	0.583834499120712	[5, 5, 5]

['he', 'him', 'his']	[(103, 105), (142, 145), (146, 149)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment seems to be discussing a specific play and mentioning a player who had an unfortunate outcome due to a mistake. Given the injury and the nature of the analysis, it's likely a detailed observation about the in-group player's performance. The fact that the comment does not disparage the player beyond the factual description ("he fucked up making a move") suggests the player is from the team the commenter supports, as fans are often more critical but still supportive of their own team. Therefore, 'he', 'him', and 'his' are all referring to the in-group player. The phrase "it cost him his knee" implies a significant injury to someone the commenter cares about, which aligns with it being an in-group player. The win probability of 68.9% suggests the in-group (Packers) are doing relatively well, but this doesn't prevent individual plays or players from being critiqued. Thus, all personal pronouns referring to the player in the second sentence should be tagged [IN].	The commenter is talking about someone who messed up and got injured, and this kind of discussion is more likely to be about a player from the team the commenter supports, as it shows a level of concern and detail indicative of in-group identification. When discussing mistakes in this context, fans usually focus on their own team's players. So, 'he', 'him', and 'his' are tagged [IN], indicating they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1635475534.0	packers	cardinals			2.0	0.6892019510269161	[5, 5, 5]

[SENT] Rofllll " I 've seen better days " playing when they come back from commercial showing [IN] on the sideline . [SENT] Hilarious . 	['Burks']	[(94, 99)]	['[IN]']	The commenter mentions Burks, who is a player for the Titans, the in-group team. Given the high win probability, the Titans are likely performing well overall, which might lead to some light-hearted or humorous comments even if a specific player (like Burks) was shown in a less favorable context. The song title "I've seen better days" playing while showing Burks on the sideline is seen as fitting humor, but since Burks is on the Titans, the reference 'Burks' should be tagged [IN]. The rest of the comment does not contain any explicit in-group, out-group, or other NFL team references. 'Hilarious' reflects the commenter's reaction to the situation, not directly referring to any entity. Thus 'Burks' is correctly tagged with [IN].	The comment mentions Burks, a player from the Titans, which is the in-group team supported by the commenter. The phrase "I've seen better days" likely refers to Burks, and the description suggests a humorous or unfortunate situation involving him, indicating that it's a specific reference to the in-group. Thus, 'Burks' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a player on the in-group team. The second sentence is a general statement and does not require additional tagging.	1664133657.0	titans	raiders	SouthernBoyChris	:Titans:	2.0	0.842088013887405	[5]

['Joe', 'Lamar', 'Chargers', 'Joe']	[(21, 24), (32, 37), (56, 64), (114, 117)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[OTHER]', '[IN]']	The first sentence discusses 'Joe' and 'Lamar,' both of whom are players on the Ravens, the in-group team. Joe being a common way for fans to refer to Joe Flacco, and Lamar to Lamar Jackson. The context implies an in-group discussion about previous decisions and team performance related to these players, so 'Joe' and 'Lamar' should be tagged as [IN]. The 'Chargers playoff game' is a reference to a past game that did not involve either the Ravens or Jets right now, thus 'Chargers' should be tagged as [OTHER] since it refers to another team in the NFL. In the second sentence, 'Joe' refers again to the player on the Ravens, and 'us' typically indicates the in-group, suggesting that the gifts (presumably easy plays or fumbles) are ones Joe Flacco is giving the team, hence 'Joe' should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is a Ravens fan, and mentions "Joe" and "Lamar." Given the context, "Joe" likely refers to Joe Flacco, a former Ravens quarterback, and "Lamar" refers to Lamar Jackson, the current Ravens quarterback. Both should be tagged with [IN] as they are associated with the in-group team. The phrase "Chargers playoff game" refers to a previous game involving the Chargers, a team that is neither the in-group nor out-group in this context, so "Chargers" should be tagged as [OTHER]. The second sentence suggests that "Joe" is doing something beneficial for the Ravens ("give us gifts"), so again "Joe" should be tagged with [IN].	1662924505.0	ravens	jets	Shade_Raven	:ED: Ed Reed	5.0	0.9919162290170789	[5, 5, 5, 5]

The win probability is relatively high, but the commenter is expressing frustration about Hernandez's performance, which indicates that 'Will Hernandez' is indeed part of the in-group. Hence, 'Will Hernandez' should be tagged [IN].	The commenter is criticizing a specific player, Will Hernandez, who is known to be part of the Giants, the in-group team. Since the comment is directed towards the in-group team's player, 'Will Hernandez' should be tagged with [IN]. This explanation aligns with the general pattern of fans criticizing or discussing specific players from the team they support.	1632682924.0	giants	falcons	bonerbasketball		1.0	0.562669694423676	[5]

Since the in-group team is the Bears, the use of "he" likely refers to a player on the Bears who threw the ball, as fans generally discuss their team's plays more often. The win probability is low, indicating the Bears are likely losing, which may make fans more critical and focused on specific plays or penalties involving their team. Thus, "he" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to a member of the commenter's supported team, the Bears.	The comment is addressing someone throwing the ball, and the phrase "because of the flag" suggests that the commenter is analyzing a specific action in the game. The pronoun "he" most likely refers to a player they are familiar with and analyzing in the context of their supported team, the Bears. It is reasonable to assume that this analysis is being made about an in-group player since fans are more likely to closely follow and critique the actions of their own team's players. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a Bears player.	1667766114.0	bears	dolphins	quagmire0	Bears	2.0	0.116266094148159	[5]

[SENT] Homie , no game is guaranteed . [IN] You need to be worried about the current game and the current game looks awful right now . 	['[SENT]']	[(39, 45)]	['[IN]']	The comment in the second sentence is implicitly about the in-group, the Bengals, given the context provided. Although the comment speaks generally to "you" needing to be worried about the current game, it is most likely directed at a fan or follower of the in-group team. The phrase "current game looks awful right now" indicates the state of the in-group team, especially given the low win probability, which suggests they are not performing well. Since no explicit entity is mentioned in the second sentence, the entire sentence is tagged as [IN] to reflect that the comment is implicitly about the in-group team. The first sentence, being a general statement without any specific referring expression, is left untagged.	The first sentence is a general statement without any specific mention of any team, so it doesn't get tagged. In the second sentence, the comment advises someone (likely a fellow Bengals fan) to worry about the current game, and describes the current game as looking awful. This implicitly refers to the in-group (Bengals) since the commenter is unhappy with the performance. Therefore, the sentence itself is tagged as referring to the in-group ([IN]) even though there are no explicit references to the in-group team or players.	1671401995.0	bengals	buccaneers	beerguy_etcetera	🐅	2.0	0.21814900636672996	[5]

This indicates dissatisfaction with their own team rather than giving credit to the opponent (Vikings). The word 'Kicker' is likely referencing the Lions' kicker, which is why it is tagged [IN]. Similarly, 'us' implicitly refers to the Lions team that the commenter supports, so it should also be tagged [IN]. The first sentence, 'Well fought,' does not explicitly refer to any team or entity and is a neutral statement reflecting on the game's overall effort, which is why it remains untagged.	The commenter is discussing aspects of their team's performance, which is something fans usually do for their own team. The phrase 'Well fought' implies they believe it was a good effort, most likely referring to their in-group team. 'Kicker' and 'coaching' are mentioned as being responsible for a negative outcome ('killed us'), indicating these elements are parts of the in-group team. Therefore, 'Kicker' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a position in the in-group team, and 'us' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the commenter and the in-group team they support.	1664137089.0	lions	vikings	Omgaspider		4.0	1.0	[5, 5]

'Lambeau' is therefore tagged as [OUT] because it clearly refers to something associated with the Packers. The first sentence implicitly involves the out-group, so the tagging correctly marks 'Lambeau' with [OUT]. The second sentence continues the comment without introducing any new entities, therefore should be untagged. The win probability is somewhat high for the in-group team (Lions), indicating they are likely doing well, yet the comment focuses on an off-field aspect (stadium bathrooms) rather than the ongoing game, typical of some fans' broader engagement with rival teams.	The commenter mentions "Lambeau," which refers to Lambeau Field, home of the Packers, the out-group team. Since this is a negative statement about a feature of Lambeau Field, it implies the commenter is criticizing the out-group's venue. The reference to "Lambeau" should therefore be tagged as [OUT] as it pertains to the opponent team's stadium. Other parts of the sentences do not refer explicitly to any in-group, out-group, or other entities, so they are not tagged.	1641760697.0	lions	packers	FeelingAverage	Ooooh Yeahhhh!	2.0	0.651669830083847	[5]

The use of the term "bust" is indicating a disappointment for a player who was a high draft pick but is not meeting expectations. Since the Eagles are the in-group team supported by the commenter, "Raegor" should be tagged as [IN]. Despite the high win probability, the commenter is still criticizing their own player, which fans often do. Thus, "Raegor" is the correct referring expression to tag as [IN].	The commenter has described Raegor as a "bust," which is typically negative and implies disappointment. Since the commenter is an Eagles supporter and fans often critique their own players more deeply when they underperform, it is reasonable that Raegor is a player for the in-group team, the Eagles. Therefore, 'Raegor' should be tagged with [IN].	1640138328.0	eagles	washington	Kryptyx		3.0	0.891760155558586	[5]

['we', 'our offense']	[(35, 37), (47, 58)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The win probability is at 100.0%, indicating that the in-group team, the Dolphins, has won the game. The commenter is addressing another group and expressing frustration at them, likely the out-group fans (Steelers supporters). The use of "we" and "our offense" unambiguously refers to the Dolphins, the in-group team, celebrating their victory even though they did not perform at their best. Thus, "we" and "our offense" should be tagged [IN] since they both refer to the in-group, the Dolphins. The term "Yall" does not need any tag as it does not refer to any team directly.	The commenter is celebrating their team's victory while also addressing other fans as unbearable. The term 'we' signifies the in-group because the commenter identifies with the Dolphins, the team that won. 'Our offense' refers to the in-group's offensive unit, indicating that the Dolphins' offense played below its best, yet they still managed to win. Thus '[IN]' correctly tags 'we' and 'our offense' as they both refer to the in-group.	1666581993.0	dolphins	steelers	TuaTyreek	:snoo_trollface:	13.0	1.0	[5, 5]

The high win probability (94.6%) suggests that the Bills are performing very well, making it reasonable for a fan to be excited about the performance of their star player. Therefore, "Josh" should be tagged as [IN] because he is a prominent member of the in-group team, leading to the correct tagged comment and list of referring expressions.	'Josh' refers to Josh Allen, who is a notable player for the Bills. Since the commenter is a Bills fan, this expression refers to the in-group. The admiration implied in the phrase "unholy things" suggests a positive regard, which further supports that 'Josh' is an in-group reference.

This is likely because the win probability is very low, indicating that the current strategy or players are not performing well, thus prompting a call for a change. Fans typically call for specific players when their own team is underperforming. Therefore, 'Sam Howell' should be tagged [IN] as he is a member of the in-group team.	'Sam Howell' is a quarterback for the Washington Commanders, and since the commenter supports the Commanders (the in-group), mentioning Sam Howell would indicate excitement or interest about their own team. Therefore, 'Sam Howell' should be tagged as [IN]. The phrase 'Sam Howell time' suggests a positive or significant event for the in-group team, which further supports tagging 'Sam Howell' with [IN].	1671923143.0	commanders	49ers	skinsrich	:redR:	5.0	0.04068561010923999	[5]

['he', 'he']	[(65, 67), (110, 112)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment is expressing frustration about a coach's ability to manage a football team, which is very likely referring to the in-group team especially given the 0.0% win probability indicating a poor performance. When fans discuss wanting someone to retire or criticizing their competence, they are usually referring to individuals associated with their own team. In this case, both instances of 'he' are referring to the in-group coach. Thus, those references should be tagged [IN] since they are criticisms levied at an in-group entity.The mention of Eric Berry's 'day to day' situation serves as a comparison to the in-group coach's poor performance and is not referencing a current player or coach, so it's only the coach that the fan is addressing. Hence, 'he' in both instances should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group (Chiefs) coach who cannot competently manage the team, making him a target of the fan's criticism.Therefore, the explanation aligns with the tagging of 'he' and 'he' as [IN].	The complaint about a coach's incompetence is typically directed towards the coach of the in-group team, as fans tend to criticize their own team's staff when they are underperforming. This explains why the reference 'he' in both instances should be tagged as [IN]. The mention of Eric Berry, who is a known former player for the Chiefs, supports this context, providing a comparison within the commenter's team background. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that the comment is a criticism about the in-group coach.So, the correct tags for 'he' in each sentence should indeed be [IN], as the commenter is likely a Chiefs fan referring to their own team's coach.	1635103527.0	chiefs	titans	TheOfficialPessimist	Travis Kelce #87	1.0	0.0004907846450810105	[5, 5]

In this case, the in-group is the Dolphins. The win probability of 68.8% suggests the Dolphins are currently performing well, giving context to the positive statement "is feasting right now." Therefore, "Our rush D" should be tagged as [IN] and there are no explicit references to the out-group or other entities within the comment.	The phrase 'Our rush D' indicates a sense of ownership and pride, which is characteristic of how fans refer to their own team's defense. It also reflects a positive sentiment about the defense's performance ('feasting right now'), reinforcing the idea that the commenter is talking about the in-group. Thus, 'Our rush D' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team's defensive unit.	1672603353.0	dolphins	patriots	Number333	:MIA13:	5.0	0.688310742378235	[5]

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The win probability for the in-group, the 49ers, is relatively low, indicating that they are struggling in the game. The comment "Ca n't score on the 1. Embarrassing." is likely reflecting frustration from the commenter's perspective towards their own team's inability to capitalize on a favorable field position. The phrase "Ca n't score on the 1" is something a fan would typically say about their own team when expressing disappointment. There are no specific words or phrases directly referring to the in-group team, but the overall context and negative sentiment towards performance implicitly points to the in-group team, the 49ers. Therefore, the entire comment is tagged with [IN] even though there are no explicit referring expressions, and '[SENT]' serves as a surrogate referring expression for the in-group.	The comment expresses disappointment and embarrassment about being unable to score from the 1-yard line, which indicates frustration typically directed at the in-group team. As no specific players or team names are mentioned directly, the sentence itself ("Can't score on the 1. Embarrassing.") implicitly refers to the in-group team. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because the comment is conveying frustration about the 49ers' performance, even without explicitly mentioning the team.	1633900526.0	49ers	cardinals	Throwaway61378		1.0	0.14771682024002097	[5]

Therefore, both 'Bears' and 'Bengals' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The win probability is around 50%, so the in-group team's outcome isn't particularly relevant to this comment. The sentence is about the progress of a different game entirely, making 'Bears' and 'Bengals' [OTHER] team references.	The Bears and Bengals are neither the Steelers (in-group) nor the Raiders (out-group), so they should be tagged as [OTHER]. The commenter is simply mentioning the score of another game featuring teams that are not directly relevant to the commenter's supported or opposed team.

The commenter mentions the Chiefs, which is neither the in-group nor the out-group team for this particular game but another team in the NFL. Therefore, the term 'Chiefs' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The extremely low win probability (4.2%) for the Chargers suggests they are likely losing, and the comment is finding consolation in the poor performance of another NFL team, which further supports the correct classification of 'Chiefs' as [OTHER].	The game is between the Chargers and the Ravens. The commenter mentions the "Chiefs," which refers to another team in the NFL, not the in-group Chargers or the out-group Ravens. Therefore, "Chiefs" should be tagged as [OTHER] since it refers to a third party that is neither the commenter's supported team (Chargers) nor the current opponent (Ravens).	1634496768.0	chargers	ravens	Bolt_Dawg77	ASAP	11.0	0.04150510858554901	[5]

The win probability of 67.2% also suggests that the Chargers are currently in a favorable position, evidenced by the statement "literally have the lead." The commenter is questioning why others might think the game is over despite their lead, reinforcing that "We" refers to the in-group team. Thus, "We" should be tagged with [IN]. There are no other explicit mentions of the in-group or out-group, so the rest of the sentence doesn't need additional tags.	The word 'We' in the comment refers to the team that the commenter supports, which is the Chargers. The phrase 'literally have the lead' further indicates that the commenter's team is performing well at the moment. The expression of disbelief ('how is the game over') also suggests that the commenter is rooting for their team to continue performing well. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged with [IN], and the entire '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN], because the sentence implicitly refers to the commenter's in-group team, the Chargers.	1670194437.0	chargers	raiders	I-Love-Daddy-Rivers	Justin HIMbert	2.0	0.672416269779205	[5]

This assumption is based on the fact that fans typically comment critically about their own team's questionable decisions, especially since the win probability is only slightly above 50%, indicating a close game where such decisions are more scrutinized by fans. There is no explicit reference to any team, so the entire sentence is tagged as [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group team based on context.	The comment criticizes a decision to go for it on 4th down. Since fans typically critique strategic decisions of their own team, it's reasonable to assume that the commenter is talking about the in-group team (Cardinals). The criticism implies that the commenter is frustrated with the decision made by the in-group team, even though no explicit mention of the team is present. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN] to reflect its implicit reference to the in-group.	1666315721.0	cardinals	saints	send_me_a_randomPM		0.0	0.518442749977112	[3]

Since the in-group is the Packers, 'EQ' is part of the in-group. 'He' in the second sentence is a pronoun that refers back to 'EQ', so it also denotes the in-group. The relatively low win probability suggests the game isn't going well for the Packers, which might prompt the commenter to focus on players who could make a difference. Thus, 'EQ' and 'He' should be tagged [IN] because they refer to the in-group player Equanimeous St. Brown.	EQ refers to Equanimeous St. Brown, who is a player for the Packers, the in-group team. The commenter is praising him for making plays and expressing a desire for him to get more opportunities, which aligns with the supportive nature towards the in-group.

The comment contains a question about his personal habits, which could be seen as derogatory or mocking, hinting at an out-group entity rather than the in-group. Therefore, 'Bob' should be tagged [OUT] since he is associated with the out-group team the commenter opposes.	The comment uses 'Bob' as a specific name, which appears to be a reference to Bob Kraft, the owner of the Patriots, known for an embarrassing scandal involving a massage parlor.

The win probability for the Raiders is 0.0%, indicating that they have lost or are almost certain to lose. The phrase "chiefs fans" explicitly mentions the out-group team, Chiefs, and should therefore be tagged as [OUT]. This references the fact that the Chiefs fans are enjoying the game, implying the Chiefs are performing well.The word "they" refers back to the Chiefs in the context of getting the touchdown. Given that "chiefs fans" is properly tagged [OUT], the pronoun "they" inherits this tag since it is referring to the same entity, the Chiefs.Thus "chiefs" should be tagged [OUT] and "they" should be tagged [OUT] as well, because they both refer to the out-group opponent, the Chiefs.	The commenter supports the Raiders, and the comment is referring to the Chiefs, who are the out-group opponent in this context. The phrase "chiefs fans" directly refers to fans of the Chiefs, making 'chiefs' tagged as [OUT]. When the commenter uses "they got that touchdown," 'they' is implicitly referring to the Chiefs, as it aligns with the context where Chiefs scored at the start of the game.

The suffix "ing" suggests an expectation or prospect of the Falcons performing in a certain way, which fans often use to describe their team's typical behavior or patterns, especially when in a lead or high win probability scenario. Hence, the term should be tagged as [IN].	The term 'Falconing' is a known expression among fans to describe a situation where the Falcons are about to make a mistake or fail in a spectacular way, based on past experiences with the team. Since this term directly references a negative action or pattern specifically associated with the Falcons, it should be tagged as [IN].

'Andy Dalton' is a player for the Saints, so he should be tagged as [OUT]. The first sentence mentions him picking apart 'this defense,' which, given the context, refers to the Buccaneers' defense and should therefore be tagged [IN]. The second sentence repeats Andy Dalton's name, emphasizing his performance, so 'Andy fuckin Dalton' should also be tagged as [OUT]. The final sentence, 'SMH,' expresses frustration, likely directed at the in-group's (Buccaneers') poor performance, hence no direct tagging is needed for that sentence. 'Andy Dalton' in both occurrences should be tagged as [OUT], and 'this defense' should be tagged as [IN].	The comment expresses frustration towards Andy Dalton's performance, which implies he is playing well against the commenter's team, the Buccaneers. 'Andy Dalton' in both the first and second sentences refers to an out-group player from the Saints and should be tagged with [OUT]. 'this defense' implicitly refers to the in-group (Buccaneers) defense being picked apart by Dalton, so it should be tagged [IN]. The second occurrence of 'Andy fuckin Dalton' in the second sentence again refers to the out-group player from the Saints, thus it is tagged [OUT].

The phrase 'playoff Watson' is a positively charged term, indicating a special performance during playoffs, which implies that the commenter is praising a player from the in-group. Given the high win probability, the Chiefs are likely performing well, giving the commenter a reason to celebrate 'playoff Watson'. Consequently, 'playoff Watson' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter is excitedly praising "playoff Watson," a player for the in-group Chiefs.

"We" is commonly and almost universally used by fans to refer to their own team, regardless of the game context or performance, solidifying that the correct tag for "We" is [IN]. Therefore, the correct tag for "We" is [IN].	'We' is a term that usually indicates the group the commenter identifies with, which in this case is the Raiders. Since the commenter is speaking about being "already home," it indicates they are discussing their own team in a casual or colloquial manner.

The pronoun 'they' typically refers to the referees or officials, who are neutral and not part of either competing team. Since the in-group team is the Browns and the out-group is the Patriots, and referees are neither part of the in-group nor the out-group, 'they' should be tagged as [OTHER] to reflect that it refers to an entity that is not associated with either team playing the game.	The commenter is expressing frustration about a potential call, likely implying it is a recurring issue or a known tendency. Since 'they' refers to the referees, who officiate all games and are not specific to either team in this game, the correct tag should be [OTHER].

In the context of discussing player health (such as "cte," or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain condition associated with repeated head trauma), fans often refer to players on their own supported team. Since the commenter supports the 49ers, "mr bradshaw" should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability indicates a relatively even game but slightly favors the 49ers, further suggesting that the focus may be on their own team's performance and health. Hence, the term "mr bradshaw" is correctly tagged [IN].	The commenter mentions "mr bradshaw" in the context of having CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy), which is a condition often talked about in relation to football players. Given that this is a game between the 49ers and the Rams, and the commenter supports the 49ers, it's reasonable to infer that "mr bradshaw" is a player on the 49ers, especially considering the negative connotation of having CTE being associated with concern or criticism from fans.

'the team' refers to the in-group team, so it should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence, "nothing's guaranteed in the rain and the same will go for atlanta's defense," references the out-group opponent, the Atlanta Falcons. Here, 'atlanta' should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to the opponent. There are no explicit mentions of other teams in the NFL, so there are no [OTHER] tags necessary. For the third sentence, "stay hype yall!", no explicit referring expressions are used, and it serves as a general call to action for (presumably) in-group supporters, but it does not require any tags in this context since it does not specify any entities directly.	The commenter is talking about a game where they support the Commanders and their opponents are referred to by the city Washington. s- In the first sentence, "the team" is used in a way that implies a defense of the in-group (the Commanders) because the commenter is critical of others saying the team sucks; thus, "the team" should be tagged as [IN].- In the second sentence, "atlanta's defense" refers to the out-group defense (Washington), possibly because in this context, Washington is referred to based on their geographical location rather than their common name. Therefore, "atlanta" should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to the opponent team where geographical references are occasionally mixed.- The third sentence does not contain any specific referring expressions and is more of an encouragement to fellow fans, so the [SENT] token does not need explicit tagging for any entity.	1669574789.0	commanders	washington	Fluggerblah	:00:	6.0	0.519475982285858	[5, 5]

Despite the relatively low win probability suggesting the game isn't strongly in their favor, the excitement over taking the lead is palpable.

In the first sentence, "They took the screen play away" refers to the defensive action of the Bears, the opposing team, stopping the screen play by the Packers. Therefore, "They" should be tagged as [OUT]. The second sentence "Good play by the bears LB" gives credit to a specific Bears player for executing the defensive play effectively. Here, "bears" clearly refers to the opposing team, so it should be tagged as [OUT], just like in the first sentence.

In this comment, 'They' in the first sentence refers to the team that stopped the screen play, which in the context of the game, is the out-group (Bears). Therefore, 'They' should be tagged [OUT]. In the second sentence, 'bears' explicitly refers to the out-group team, and 'LB' (linebacker) is a player for the Bears, hence they should be tagged [OUT] as well.

The phrase "the defense" likely refers to the defense of the opposing team (the Browns) because the commenter is talking about exhausting the defense to take control of the game. Given the high win probability, the in-group team might be performing well, and the commenter is expressing confidence in their team's ability to maintain or improve their performance. Therefore, "we" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the Ravens, and "the defense" should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the opposing Browns' defense.	The commenter expresses optimism for a successful drive, indicating they hope to exhaust the opponent's defense. The word 'we' typically denotes the speaker's own team, marking 'we' as referring to the in-group, the Ravens. The phrase 'the defense' is used without qualification, suggesting it refers to the opposing team's defense, and thus is referring to the out-group, the Browns. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged as [IN], and 'the defense' should be tagged as [OUT].	1638157001.0	ravens	browns	MattTheBaltimorePat7	:GINO: Gino Marchetti	2.0	0.896345973014832	[5, 5]

The win probability is very low at 2.8%, indicating the Panthers are likely performing poorly in the game. Fans in such situations often criticize their own team. The phrase "this team" is vague and general, which suggests that it is referring to the team that the commenter is most concerned or familiar with, which in this case is the in-group team, the Panthers. The critical nature of the comment towards "this team" also aligns with typical in-group commentary when a team is underperforming. Hence, 'this team' should be tagged with [IN].The commenter is a supporter of the Panthers, who are doing poorly in the game given the low win probability. The phrase "this team" is a general reference that, in the context of a fan's critique, likely pertains to the Panthers. With fans often critiquing their own team when they underperform, "this team" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group.	The phrase "this team" likely refers to the team that the commenter supports, as fans typically criticize their own team's coaching directly. It is unlikely that the commenter would offer such a broad critique of the opponent's coaching in this manner. Therefore, "this team" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	1639940121.0	panthers	bills	boog1evilleUSA		18.0	0.027702985240754985	[5]

[SENT] Terrible play call 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The first sentence "Play for the win" is implicitly referring to the in-group, the Dolphins, as the commenter is likely urging their team to continue their efforts to secure the victory given that their win probability is 100.0%, suggesting the Dolphins are winning. There is no explicit referring expression in the first sentence, so the entire sentence is tagged as [IN]. The second sentence "Terrible play call" is a standalone comment and doesn't contain any explicit referring expressions. Given the context, it can be interpreted as a general criticism of a specific play call that doesn't clearly indicate the team. Therefore, the second sentence is tagged as [SENT].	The first sentence likely refers to the in-group team, as the commenter is urging the team to "play for the win," indicative of a supportive tone towards the team they root for. The second sentence criticism of a "Terrible play call" is also likely targeted at the in-group team. However, since there are no explicit in-group identifiers within this sentence and the criticism could apply universally, it has not been tagged with a specific label. Therefore, '[SENT]' for the first sentence should be tagged with '[IN]' since the instruction to play for the win is directed at the in-group without explicit mention, while the second sentence remains untagged due to the lack of direct reference.	1634489516.0	dolphins	jaguars	TheHighestFlyer		1.0	1.0	[5]

['[SENT]', 'We', 'We']	[(0, 6), (45, 47), (73, 75)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment mentions "Washington" scoring touchdowns in the first sentence, and since the in-group is the Colts and the out-group is the Eagles, "Washington" is neither, thus it is tagged as [OTHER]. The second and third sentences talk about how "we" barely make field goals and are not the same, which implicitly refers to the in-group team based on the perspective of the commenter. The win probability indicates that the game is fairly close, but the commenter is likely dissatisfied with the in-group's performance in comparison to Washington's. Therefore, "We" in both the second and third sentences should be tagged as [IN]. The second and third sentences themselves also implicitly refer to the in-group's performance, thus they are tagged [IN]. This explains the targets and referring expressions provided in the comment.	The game is between the Colts and the Eagles. The word 'Washington' refers to another team in the NFL, the Washington Commanders, which is neither the in-group nor the out-group for this game. Therefore, 'Washington' is tagged [OTHER]. The term 'We' in the second and third sentences refers to the commenter's in-group team, the Colts, as the commenter is discussing the performance of their own team (barely making field goals and not being the same). Therefore, both instances of 'We' are tagged [IN]. The first sentence itself does not have a reference to the in-group or out-group as it references an unrelated team, so it is tagged [SENT]. Thus, 'Washington' is tagged [OTHER], 'We' is tagged [IN] in both the second and third sentences, and the first sentence token is tagged [SENT].	1668975666.0	colts	eagles	vanillathrilla04	Anthony Richardszn	5.0	0.558046936988831	[5, 5, 5]

The comment expresses frustration about a particular offensive strategy 'run-run-pass 3 and out,' suggesting the commenter is critical of their own team's play-calling. The use of 'we' signifies that the commenter is referring to their own team, the 49ers, which is the in-group. Thus 'we' should be tagged with [IN].	The word 'we' typically refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. The frustration expressed about their team's play-calling ('run-run-pass 3 and out') indicates that the commenter is talking about the in-group team, as fans generally vent about the shortcomings and mistakes of the team they support. Thus, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group, the 49ers, in this context.	1662924326.0	49ers	bears	Fedora_Master_	:jerseyhome97: Nick Bosa	12.0	0.483335465192795	[5]

The comment expresses excitement and praise for a "Nice 1st down," which is indicative of support for the in-group team. Fans generally cheer and feel elation for favorable plays performed by their supported team, even if they do not explicitly mention the team's name. The use of phrases like "Wow" and "Nice 1st down" implicitly refers to the in-group team achieving success on the field. Therefore, both sentences in the comment implicitly refer to the in-group team, justifying the [IN] tags for both sentences.Additionally, there are no specific words or phrases directly referencing a team, player, or any entity within the in-group, out-group, or other NFL teams. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged for both the first exclamation of excitement and the second sentence acknowledging the successful play under the in-group label.	The excitement expressed in the comment ("Wow!" and "Nice 1st down!") is likely directed towards the in-group team since fans typically express positive reactions toward their own team's achievements. There are no explicit references to any team or players in the comment, but the sentiment indicates support for the in-group team, Titans. Therefore, both sentences are implicitly referring to the in-group and should be tagged '[IN]'.	1673149746.0	titans	jaguars	FawdaJinn		1.0	0.652552485466003	[5, 5]

The phrase "Holding on 69" typically refers to an offensive holding penalty on a player with jersey number 69. Since the commenter is a Patriots fan and it is common for fans to point out their own team's penalties in a critical manner, the comment implies disappointment with an in-group player. Consequently, the whole sentence should be tagged with [IN], acknowledging that "Holding on 69" refers implicitly to an in-group team member responsible for the penalty. Given that no specific words or phrases point directly to the in-group, the entire sentence represents the in-group implicitly.	The commenter is likely expressing dissatisfaction with a holding penalty called on player number 69. This expression of frustration or sarcasm is more likely directed towards a mistake made by their own team, the in-group. Since there is no explicit word or phrase that identifies the entity directly, the sentence as a whole should be tagged with [IN] to indicate the comment is about the in-group team. Thus, '[SENT]' is correctly tagged with '[IN]'.	1636914065.0	patriots	browns	DJScrubatires		2.0	0.401578903198242	[5]

Given the Dolphins are the in-group and the Bills are the out-group, it is likely that 'they' refers to the Bills. Fans typically voice frustrations about the opponent getting favorable conditions or calls, which aligns with the low win probability for the Dolphins. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to the Bills, the opponent team.	The commenter is complaining about the opposing team benefitting from an unfair situation, indicated by the phrase "without being charged one". Given the in-group is the Dolphins, "they" in this context likely refers to the out-group, which is the Bills. Thus, "they" should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group opponent team.	1664132887.0	dolphins	bills	tonitone__		9.0	0.241773545742035	[5]

The win probability being slightly above 50% suggests a competitive but favorable edge for the in-group, making it plausible for the commenter to focus on a positive achievement by an in-group player. Since the sentence does not explicitly mention the player's name or team, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to indicate that the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group team.	The commenter does not explicitly mention any player or team in their comment. However, given that it is a live comment during a Dolphins game, it is implied that the commenter is referring to the in-group (the Dolphins) since they are celebrating a player as the "September MVP." This is something a supporter is more likely to do for their own team rather than an opponent's team. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN] implicitly referring to the in-group.	1672000707.0	dolphins	packers	restore_democracy		1.0	0.556560516357422	[5]

The high win probability of 75.9% for the in-group suggests that the Chiefs are doing well and likely to win the game. The comment sarcastically notes that the Bengals' "trick is to suck ass first half," indicating a poor performance by the out-group team in the first half of the game. Therefore, "Bengals" should be tagged as [OUT] since it directly refers to the out-group team that the Chiefs are playing against.	The word 'Bengals' directly refers to the out-group team that the commenter does not support. The negative connotation of 'suck ass first half' further indicates the commenter is criticizing the opponent team, reinforcing the out-group association.

The comment criticizes a poor performance, and since it is not qualified with any additional context implying it was about an opponent, it can be inferred that "Claypool" is being criticized as part of the in-group. The high win probability suggests the Steelers are likely winning or performing well overall, but the comment is focusing on an instance of poor performance from a player on the team they support. Therefore, "Claypool" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	The comment specifically mentions "Claypool," who is a player for the in-group team, the Steelers. The commenter is expressing disappointment with Claypool's performance, indicating that they are focusing on their own team's player. Therefore, "Claypool" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to an in-group member, and the rest of the sentence implicitly continues the focus on the in-group team's performance.	1634527893.0	steelers	seahawks	fate3	:tomlin1a::tomlin1b:Encroachment	5.0	0.78730320930481	[5]

[SENT] did you not notice that [OUT] have only scored a FG so far 	['he', 'the Pats']	[(15, 17), (71, 79)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	In the given comment, "he" is likely referring to a coach or player from the in-group (Jets), questioning what kind of adjustments will be made. Without additional context, referring to a coach or player as "he" is something fans typically do for their own team. Therefore, "he" should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, "the Pats" clearly refers to the Patriots, who are the out-group opponent team. The comment points out that the Patriots have only scored a field goal, which matches the out-group's lack of performance implied by the win probability. Thus, "the Pats" should be properly tagged as [OUT].	The first sentence contains "he," which likely refers to the in-group team's coach or a prominent player, since the commenter expresses an interest in what adjustments will be made, something typically of concern to a fan of the in-group. The second sentence explicitly mentions "the Pats," a commonly known shorthand for the Patriots, the out-group team, and notes their limited scoring, indicating it's about the opposing team. Thus, "he" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group, and "the Pats" should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group.The comment is about the in-group coach or player making adjustments, indicating the commenter's interest in their in-group team, thus "he" is tagged [IN]. The mention of the "Pats" refers to the out-group opponent team, indicating it's about the Patriots' performance, thus "the Pats" is tagged [OUT].	1668973925.0	jets	patriots	smartid		1.0	0.43596190214157104	[4, 5]

This type of critique is most commonly directed toward in-group players rather than the opposing team. Hence, 'these guys' and 'they' are most likely referring to the in-group (Bears), indicating dissatisfaction with their performance or adherence to rules. Given the win probability is relatively high for the in-group, the commenter may still feel they have a chance to improve during the game. Therefore, 'these guys' and 'they' should both be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is discussing the need for improvement and rule adherence, which reflects frustration typically directed at one's own team. The phrases 'these guys' and 'they' are criticism aimed without specifying any external team, implying they are talking about the in-group team they support. Therefore, 'these guys' and 'they' should be tagged with [IN].	1632072091.0	bears	bengals	L3p3rM3ssiah	Sweetness	1.0	0.630826652050018	[5, 5]

Given the extremely low win probability, it is possible that the Jaguars are not performing well and the commenter is frustrated or trying to defend their team against criticism or incorrect assumptions. Therefore, "they" should be tagged as [IN] to indicate that it refers to the in-group team, the Jaguars.	The comment 'No they don't' is a response that usually involves disputing a claim or statement about the team the commenter supports. Since 'they' refers to the subject of the sentence, and the context does not suggest it is referencing the out-group, it is reasonable to infer that 'they' refers to the in-group team, the Jaguars. Thus, 'they' should be tagged [IN].	1635714733.0	jaguars	seahawks	WuvalCounty	:Logo25:	0.0	0.025038123130798007	[5]

Given the context that the in-group is the Titans and the win probability is high for them, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is discussing a player from the in-group, possibly hinting at a strategic decision made by the Titans to limit the player's running plays. Consequently, 'he' and 'his' are tagged as [IN] because they are referring to a player from the in-group team (Titans).	The commenter likely refers to a key player on the in-group team, the Titans, when mentioning 'he' and 'his'. Such speculation about a player being instructed to take certain actions is typically about a team's own strategy and performance considerations.

The use of "we" and "we" should be tagged as [IN] since they clearly refer to the in-group team. The first sentence uses "we" twice to discuss the in-group's potential strategies in a somewhat humorous manner ("trade for a great QB" vs. "pick the mystery boxes"). The win probability is at 43.4%, which suggests the game is still competitive, but the comment's focus is on future possibilities rather than the immediate game. The second and third sentences provide general observations about salary caps and QB contracts but do not refer directly to any specific team, and thus do not have any tags. Therefore, "we" in both occurrences refers to the Eagles and is tagged as [IN].	The word "we" in both instances refers to the in-group team (the Eagles) as it indicates what options their team might have regarding the quarterback position. Fans typically use "we" to speak about potential actions or decisions their own team could make. The sentences discuss the potential for the Eagles to trade for a great quarterback or to take a gamble on an unknown option ("mystery boxes"), and the considerations about salary cap and the effectiveness of high-end QB contracts are general observations rather than referring specifically to either team in the current game. Therefore, "we" should be tagged as [IN]. The sentences that discuss these decisions and strategies implicitly refer to the in-group team, hence '[SENT]' in these sentences are rightly tagged with '[IN]'. There are no direct references to the out-group or any other team.The phrase "we" is used twice to discuss possible actions or decisions regarding the Eagles' quarterback situation, indicating that the commenter is referring to the in-group team.

The low win probability for the Seahawks suggests they are in a tough spot, and the commenter is likely wishing for the help of a strong player from another team.

Jalen Carter is a player who is neither on the Seahawks (in-group) nor the 49ers (out-group), but he is currently part of the Philadelphia Eagles.

Given the low win probability, the commenter is likely a Jaguars supporter expressing frustration or sarcasm about how opponents often achieve career highs against their team. The phrase "the jags" and "a jags" in both sentences should be tagged with [IN] because they refer to the in-group team, the Jaguars, that the commenter supports.	The Jaguars are the in-group team the commenter supports. In the first sentence, "the jags" refers to the Jaguars, indicating the commenter is talking about a notable performance or statistic achieved against their own team, implying acknowledgment of an in-group entity's negative moment. In the second sentence, "a jags game" suggests that such statistics or performances are characteristic or expected in games involving the Jaguars, further indicating reference to the in-group team.

Both individuals mentioned, Ballard (Chris Ballard, the general manager) and Eberflus (Matt Eberflus, the defensive coordinator at the time), are part of the in-group team's management and coaching staff. 'The defense' also refers to the in-group's defensive unit. The high win probability (95.5%) indicates the in-group is likely winning, so the focus on internal critique despite the probable win suggests close attention to team performance and management. Thus, 'the defense', 'Ballard', and 'Eberflus' should all be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is discussing key figures associated with their in-group team, the Colts. The phrase 'the defense' is likely referring to the in-group's defense, given that criticisms and discussions about defensive performance are often associated with the team a fan supports. 'Ballard' and 'Eberflus' are high-profile names within the Colts organization (with Chris Ballard being the general manager and Matt Eberflus being a former defensive coordinator), which signifies these are figures associated with the in-group team. The criticisms and discussions are aimed at internal personnel decisions and performance, reinforcing that the commenter is talking about the in-group. Therefore, 'the defense', 'Ballard' (mentioned twice), and 'Eberflus' (mentioned twice) should all be tagged as [IN].	1636075822.0	colts	jets	TheColtOfPersonality	Indianapolis Colts	0.0	0.954501699656248	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

McVay is the head coach of the Rams, so the comment refers to a member of the in-group. The win probability is low, suggesting that the in-group team is struggling, which aligns with the critique in the comment. Thus 'McVay' should be tagged as [IN] since he is part of the in-group team the commenter supports.	Sean McVay is the head coach of the Rams, which is the in-group team that the commenter supports. Therefore, 'McVay' should be tagged with [IN], as he directly refers to a member of the in-group. The phrase 'burned a TO just to get burned up the middle again' indicates frustration with the actions of the in-group, further confirming that 'McVay' is indeed part of the in-group in this context.	1638141857.0	rams	packers	probablysmellsmydog	Blue/Yellow Helmet Logo	6.0	0.282736837863922	[5]

['[SENT]', 'we']	[(0, 6), (80, 82)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment suggests that it is in a very favorable position and that it would require a major mistake to lose the game now. This aligns with the high win probability for the in-group. In the first sentence, "this" implicitly refers to the current game situation and the commenter's team (Cardinals), so the sentence can be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "we" implies the commenter and fellow fans, referring to the in-group, so it should be tagged [IN] as well.	The first sentence implies that the in-group team (Cardinals) is in a strong position, as the phrase "monumental fuck up to lose this now" suggests confidence in their current standing. Given this context, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is discussing the in-group team without explicitly mentioning them, thereby tagging '[SENT]' with '[IN]'. In the second sentence, the use of "we" strongly indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group supporters or the team itself, thus "we" should be tagged with '[IN]'.	1636329116.0	cardinals	49ers	poisonedmonkey	:cardinals: Cardinals	2.0	0.9621527642011642	[5, 5]

['Malik']	[(11, 16)]	['[IN]']	The name "Malik" here most likely refers to Malik Willis, who is a player for the Titans, the in-group team. The high win probability suggests the Titans are doing well in the game. The commenter is likely responding to a question or criticism about the game, possibly hinting that having Malik (a key player) on the field should have led to better expectations. Therefore, "Malik" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team.	The commenter mentions 'Malik,' a player for the in-group Titans. Since the commenter is asking what the other person was expecting, it implies that they consider Malik's performance a known quantity, likely because he is on the team they support. Therefore, 'Malik' should be tagged [IN] as he is a member of the Titans, the in-group team relative to the commenter.	1666552424.0	titans	colts	WhiteXHysteria	300 to link?	1.0	0.856552958488464	[5]

Given that fans typically discuss their own team's injuries and performance critically, the reference to 'the defense' is likely about the in-group team, the Browns in this case. The win probability being relatively low supports the idea that the commenter is lamenting the performance of their own team, despite the injuries. Therefore, 'the defense' should be tagged with [IN], as it pertains to the injury-plagued defensive unit of the in-group team, Browns.	The commenter mentions "the defense" without any additional qualifiers or context that would suggest they are talking about the opponent's defense. It is common for fans to discuss their own team's issues, such as acknowledging injuries on the in-group team. Therefore, "the defense" is understood to refer to the in-group's defense, which in this case is the Browns. Thus, "the defense" should be tagged with [IN].	1633905085.0	browns	chargers	ddottay	:brownie-elf:	3.0	0.44118777520346997	[5]

Given the low win probability of 23.5%, it indicates that the in-group team (Titans) is likely struggling in the game. The phrase "first two drives of the game" implies that the critique is referring to a specific period within the game, which is something fans often discuss about their own team's performance. Therefore, the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Titans, as the team that "looked terrible". Hence, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' even though there is no explicit word or phrase referring to the in-group within the comment.	The comment is likely complaining about the performance of the team the commenter supports, as fans typically criticize their own team rather than the opponent. The sentence indicates dissatisfaction with the quality of play during the initial stages of the game, which is more commonly directed towards the in-group. Since there is no specific mention of the in-group team players or entities, the entire sentence context is tagged as [IN].	1635702752.0	titans	colts	arajc		2.0	0.23482884238969104	[5]

['Rodgers']	[(36, 43)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is defending Aaron Rodgers, who is a well-known player for the Packers in this context. Given that Rodgers is a member of the in-group team, any reference to him should be tagged with [IN]. The win probability is low, indicating that the Packers are likely losing, which could explain why the commenter is defending Rodgers despite the team's poor performance. The phrase 'All the people that hated on Rodgers' suggests that the commenter is addressing critics of the in-group's quarterback, reinforcing that 'Rodgers' is part of the in-group. The second sentence does not contain any explicit references to players or teams, so it does not require any tags. Therefore, 'Rodgers' should be properly tagged [IN], and no other tags are necessary.	Aaron Rodgers is a prominent player for the Packers, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. The statement is defending Rodgers from his critics, which indicates the commenter is supportive of him and by extension the in-group team. Therefore, 'Rodgers' is correctly tagged with '[IN]' since it refers to a key player from the in-group team. There are no explicit references to the out-group (Chiefs) or other groups, so only the relevant referring expression is tagged appropriately. The second sentence is a follow-up to the first and does not introduce any new entities to be tagged.	1636328884.0	packers	chiefs	FireBird02		10.0	0.029640061780810023	[5]

['we']	[(42, 44)]	['[IN]']	The comment expresses dissatisfaction with the team's play calling, which is a kind of critique that fans typically direct towards their own team rather than the opponent. The pronoun 'we' is used, which almost always signifies that the commenter is referring to the in-group team. The high win probability suggests the in-group team (Patriots) is doing well overall, but the commenter may still critique certain aspects of the play. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged as [IN] because it clearly refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. The first sentence doesn't have a clear reference to any entity, so it's left untagged.Thus, 'we' is correctly tagged as [IN] in the second sentence. The in-group team is implicitly understood from the context of the complaint about changing the play strategy.	The phrase 'we' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, which is the Patriots. Fans typically use 'we' to talk about their own team. The second sentence questions why their team (the Patriots) stopped using certain plays, indicating dissatisfaction with the in-group's play-calling strategy. Thus, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group Patriots, making 'we' the correct tagged entity.	1637292468.0	patriots	falcons	niknik8		2.0	0.9740439653396606	[5]

['JA17']	[(40, 44)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is a supporter of the Bills and is referring to the quarterback Josh Allen, who is commonly nicknamed 'JA17'. The win probability is high, suggesting that the Bills are doing well at the time of the comment. The commenter appears to think that the announcers are biased against JA17, which implicitly supports the in-group team. Therefore, 'JA17', which refers to Josh Allen, should be tagged with [IN] since he is a key player for the in-group (Bills). The rest of the comment does not contain explicit references to any other entities that need to be tagged. Thus, 'JA17' is tagged properly as [IN], reflective of the in-group team the commenter supports.	JA17 is the jersey number for Josh Allen, the quarterback for the Buffalo Bills, which is the in-group. The complaint about the announcers being haters of JA17 suggests a defense of an in-group player. '[IN]' correctly tags 'JA17' as it refers to an in-group entity, the Bills' player.

The comment is disparaging, implying that the Texans are composed of discarded or lesser-regarded players. Despite the Jaguars having a somewhat favorable win probability at this point (61.0%), the commenter focuses on criticizing the opponent. Thus, 'Houston' is tagged as [OUT] because it clearly refers to the out-group opponent team, the Texans.	The comment refers to "Houston" in a critical or dismissive manner, labeling the team as the "team of lost and wayward NFL players." Given that "Houston" refers to the Texans, the out-group team in this context, the word "Houston" should be tagged with [OUT]. The critical stance typically implies the team being discussed is one the commenter does not support, further confirming it as the out-group. Therefore, "Houston" should be tagged as [OUT], disrupting the reference aligned with the out-group.The commenter is referring to the Texans, the out-group team, in a negative context, describing them as a "team of lost and wayward NFL players."

'we' in the first sentence and 'We' in the third sentence should be tagged with [IN] since the commenter is referring to the in-group team, the Titans. Despite the relatively high win probability, the commenter is focusing on immediate concerns such as injuries and questioning the competence of the team's strength and conditioning staff, which is something that a fan would typically do when discussing their own team. Thus, in both instances, the terms 'we' and 'We' are implicitly referring to the Titans, the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter is expressing frustration about the state of their in-group team, the Titans, questioning their strength and conditioning staff and lamenting injuries. The use of 'we' and 'We' are often indicative of in-group references, as they imply a personal connection to the team being discussed. The question about the strength and conditioning staff and the statement about injuries are clearly about the Titans, the team the commenter supports.

The win probability is 100%, showing that the game is already won by the in-group, which aligns with the comment about being happy that "we" won. The sentiment of the comment is related to the overall performance even though they won, which a fan would introspect about their own team. Therefore, all instances of "we" should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to the in-group team, the Vikings. Additionally, no explicit mention of the out-group (Lions) or any other team is made, supporting the sole focus on the in-group.	The commenter is talking about a game where they support the Vikings (in-group). The repeated use of 'we' throughout the comment suggests that they are referring to their own team, the Vikings, discussing their struggles and eventual win. Fans usually refer to their own team as 'we'. Therefore, in the first sentence, 'we' is tagged as [IN] in all four instances, as it implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Vikings. In the second sentence, 'we' again refers to the in-group, expressing relief at the win but also a lack of confidence.

Since the in-group team is positioned favorably with a win probability of 63.2%, it is logical that the commenter is focusing on the performance of their own team's players. 'Both guys' refers to players on the Buccaneers who were open for a pass. 'Brady' obviously refers to Tom Brady, the Buccaneers' quarterback, and 'julio' refers to Julio Jones, a wide receiver for the Buccaneers. Therefore, all these expressions should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to members of the in-group.	The commenter is a supporter of the Buccaneers and is discussing a play involving Tom Brady and Julio Jones, who are both key players for the Buccaneers. 'Both guys' implies players from the same team, which without additional context, defaults to the in-group. 'Brady' explicitly refers to Tom Brady, a recognized Buccaneers player, and 'julio' refers to Julio Jones, another recognized Buccaneers player. Thus, 'Both guys', 'Brady', and 'julio' should all be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1670291736.0	buccaneers	saints	BucsFan11	:bucslogo: 	3.0	0.632387578487396	[5, 5, 5]

The exclamation "AW SHIT HERE WE GO" indicates a moment of anticipation or concern as Jordan Love enters the game, which is relevant given the low win probability, suggesting the in-group is not doing well. Thus, 'JORDAN LOVE' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	The comment mentions "Jordan Love," who is a player for the Packers, the in-group team that the commenter supports. The expression "AW SHIT HERE WE GO" indicates a strong reaction, likely in anticipation of an event involving their own team's player. This reaction suggests the commenter's focus on the in-group team. Thus, "JORDAN LOVE" should be tagged as [IN], and the sentence is correctly tagged with '[IN]' since it revolves around a significant moment involving the in-group player.	1669608033.0	packers	eagles	Outrageous_Bass_1328		7.0	0.029107868671417014	[5]

The usage of 'D' without any qualifying adjective implies that it pertains to the in-group team, given it is common for fans to refer to their own team's defense in such a manner during game discussions. Additionally, the low win probability suggests that the team is performing poorly, which aligns with the critique of the defense being tired and sluggish. Therefore, 'D' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team.	"D" is shorthand for "Defense," and in the context of the game, it would typically refer to the defense of the team that the commenter supports.

Thus, the term 'Bills' should be tagged [OTHER]. This aligns with the context as the comment does not discuss either the Jaguars (in-group) or the Chargers (out-group) directly, but instead references a different team and a past event. The extremely low win probability indicates the in-group is heavily losing, possibly prompting the commenter to reminisce about past games rather than focus on the current performance.

The game being referred to involves the Bills, who are neither the in-group (Jaguars) nor the out-group (Chargers), making the Bills tagged [OTHER].

"[We] will be fine": The pronoun "We" in the context of a sports comment typically refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. Here, it signifies that the Eagles will be fine, so "We" should be tagged [IN].  2. "Definitely missing [Howard] out there, our bruiser and likely the best RB we have": Howard is a player for the Eagles, referred to as "our" bruiser and the best RB, signifying that he is part of the in-group. Therefore, "Howard" should be tagged [IN].3. "It's affecting [Hurts] as well": Hurts is another player for the Eagles. Since the context mentions how Howard's absence affects Hurts, this ties him to the in-group team. Thus, "Hurts" should be tagged [IN].4. "If [we] run, [we] will be fine": The pronoun "we" is repeated here, continuing to refer to the Eagles, as the statement is about what the team needs to do to be successful. Both instances of	The commenter is expressing sentiments and analysis about the in-group team, the Eagles. "We" is mentioned multiple times, usually indicating the team that the commenter supports, so it should be tagged [IN] for all occurrences. "Howard" and "Hurts" are players for the Eagles, thus they should also be tagged with [IN]. The emphasis on the challenges and solution strategies involving these players (like running the ball and how it's affecting Hurts) shows that these sentences are about the in-group team, justifying the [IN] tags.	1638127908.0	eagles	giants	Mrdwight101		5.0	0.6553468108177181	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

The low win probability suggests that the team is not doing well at the moment, which aligns with the comment indicating that the Lions need a better quarterback to become Super Bowl contenders. The context and the explicit mention of 'lions' make it clear that this comment is about the in-group team, hence 'lions' should be tagged [IN].	The commenter is likely a supporter of the Lions, as indicated by the context. The statement "lions are a QB away from being super bowl contenders" suggests a level of optimism and potential improvement for the Lions, which is characteristic of a comment from a fan of the team.

The win probability of 61.8% suggests the in-group, Ravens, are doing relatively well, but the disappointment likely pertains to an important player from the in-group being unable to participate in a play or the game. Fans tend to show more emotional reactions regarding their own players. Thus, 'he' is tagged as [IN] because it refers to a Ravens player, reflecting the commenter's concern regarding their own team.	The comment likely refers to an in-group player since a fan would express disappointment about a player being out if that player were on the team they support.

The win probability being low at 15.1% suggests the Falcons are not doing well in the game. The commenter explicitly mentions they "love playing with Falcons players," showing support for the in-group team, and is asking for better overall ratings (OVR) for these players in a video game context (likely Madden NFL). The term "Falcons" is a clear indication of the in-group and should be tagged as [IN], and the word "we" in "but we need better OVR's" also refers to the in-group, expressing the commenter's desire for their team to improve.

The win probability for the Colts is extremely low, indicating a likely loss and adding to the comment's negative tone. The word 'texans' refers to a team outside the current game, so it should be tagged as [OTHER] since it does not pertain to either the in-group or the out-group.

This is a common way for fans to refer to their own team, showing a sense of belonging and support. Despite the somewhat low win probability indicating a challenging situation for the Vikings, the commenter discusses the possibility of losing this game and subsequent games, displaying concern for their team's performance. Therefore, "We" should be tagged as [IN] since it clearly refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.

The win probability is nearly even, suggesting the game is competitive, but the commenter still wants to highlight a strong performance by an individual. 'that man' is a reference to a player who is performing well, and since the commenter is likely viewing the praised player favorably, it suggests that this player is from the in-group team. Thus, 'that man' should be tagged as [IN].	The comment "Give that man all the money" is likely praising a player whose performance has impressed the commenter. Since the commenter is a Panthers fan, it is reasonable to infer that the praise is directed towards a Panthers player, as fans typically advocate rewarding players from their own team.

The commenter uses the term "we," which identifies themself as a fan or supporter of the Patriots, in conjunction with "our D," emphasizing ownership and association with the in-group's defense. The low win probability suggests that the Patriots are struggling, enhancing the context of dissatisfaction with their own team's defensive performance. Therefore, "our D" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The word "our" in "our D" indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team's defense, which would be the in-group team, the Patriots.

In this case, it is likely that the Vikings' kicker had a miss or a poor performance, leading the commenter to make this remark. The win probability being slightly above 50% suggests that the game is relatively close, reinforcing that moments like missed kicks are crucial and noteworthy to fans. Thus, even though no explicit reference to the team or players was made, the sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group team, the Vikings. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment is about the in-group's experience with kicking.	The comment likely refers to the in-group team, the Vikings, and their performance regarding kickers, a common talking point among fans regarding their team's perceived weaknesses or recent struggles. Given the comment's tone, it's probably a negative remark about their own team's kicker(s), which is a common subject among in-group fans discussing their team. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment implicitly critiques the in-group without explicitly mentioning it.	1664132830.0	vikings	lions	echelon999		6.0	0.523175776004791	[4]

The use of "lets give" suggests a causal conversation among supporters, implying empathy or understanding towards Jamal, which aligns with fans discussing their own team. The phrases "his head," "His face," and "His fingers" all refer to the same entity, Jamal, and are part of a discussion defending or explaining his actions during the game. Since Jamal is a player on the in-group Seahawks, all these referring expressions should be tagged as [IN] to correctly identify that the discussion revolves around an in-group player. The win probability being below 50% also matches the commentary focus on the player's efforts, possibly seen in a sympathetic or critical light but still about their own team.	In the context of the in-group being the Seahawks and the out-group being the Broncos, the comment is referring to a player on the Seahawks named Jamal, likely Jamal Adams, who is a well-known safety for the Seahawks. The supportive nature of the comment ("Guys lets give Jamal a break") indicates that the commenter is defending an in-group player. The subsequent sentences also refer to parts of Jamal's body ("his head," "His face," "His fingers"), all of which refer to the same in-group player.

The comment "That was so satisfying lol" suggests enjoyment or satisfaction from a particular play or moment, which would most commonly be a positive event for the commenter. Since the in-group is so close to winning, any satisfying moment is most likely a negative event for the out-group (Cardinals). Thus, the comment is implicitly about the out-group, marking the entire sentence as [OUT].	The comment "That was so satisfying lol" has no direct references to any team or player, but from the context, it is likely that the commenter is happy about something negative happening to the out-group. For a 49ers fan, it would be satisfying to see the Cardinals experiencing a setback. Thus, the sentiment of satisfaction is directed towards the out-group. Since there's no explicit reference and the entire sentence implies satisfaction from something against the out-group, the entire '[SENT]' should be tagged as [OUT].	1669088462.0	49ers	cardinals	giantdub49	:jerseyhome23: Christian McCaffrey	1.0	0.9952083043754101	[5]

Considering that the comment is a criticism, and fans typically direct these criticisms towards their own team, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is frustrated with the Seahawks (in-group). The win probability of 61.3% suggests the Seahawks are somewhat likely to win, but the commenter is focused on immediate tactical decisions, which explains why they are complaining regardless of the team's overall favorable position. Thus, even though the comment lacks explicit mention of a team, it implicitly criticizes the tactics of the in-group team, which justifies tagging the entire sentence as referring to the in-group. The comment reflects a common scenario where fans critique their own team's play-calling. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' since it implicitly refers to the in-group.	The comment is expressing frustration with a strategic decision (screen passes), which likely pertains to the team the commenter supports. Since the commenter is a Seahawks fan, this frustration is directed towards the in-group team (Seahawks). There's no explicit word or phrase referring to the in-group directly, but the context indicates that the comment is about the in-group's performance. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged as '[IN]' to indicate the in-group is being referred to implicitly.	1663035011.0	seahawks	broncos	jzfaus725		4.0	0.613436043262482	[5]

Given the context that the in-group team (Falcons) has a low win probability (27.7%), it's probable the commenter is frustrated or emphasizing a need for more effective running plays from their own team to improve their chances. Since there are no explicit references to specific players, teams, or cities, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Falcons. Therefore, the sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN], as it implicitly refers to the in-group team.	The comment consists of a series of "run" commands which likely indicate a suggestion or encouragement directed towards the in-group team the commenter supports. Since there are no specific words or phrases that explicitly mention the in-group, the entire sentence is tagged as [IN] to reflect that the intended recipient of this encouragement is the Falcons.	1671395803.0	falcons	saints	bobbiloma		1.0	0.27693718671798695	[5]

Therefore, this sentence should be tagged with [IN].In the second sentence, "Diggs" is giving "our offense the short field" which disrupts their rhythm. The use of "our" indicates the in-group (Seahawks), and "Diggs" is a player for the Seahawks. This demonstrates that both "Diggs" and "our offense" refer to the in-group. Finally, "Come on, Diggs!" in the third sentence continues to address Diggs, maintaining the pattern established in the previous sentence. Given that Diggs has already been identified as part of the in-group, he is tagged as [IN] here as well.Thus, "Diggs" should consistently be tagged as [IN] throughout the comment, and "our offense" should also be tagged as [IN]. The sentences concerning these entities should also incorporate appropriate tagging to reflect their references.	The comment is positive and critique-focused with respect to the in-group, implying engagement typical of a fan. The '[SENT]' at the beginning is providing a positive update, likely about the in-group since the commenter is a Seahawks supporter. 'Diggs' is likely a reference to Quandre Diggs, a player on the Seahawks. The phrase 'our offense' indicates possession, referring to the commenter's team, the Seahawks. Thus, 'Diggs' and 'our offense' should be tagged [IN] since they are both references to the in-group team. Finally, the last sentence is encouraging 'Diggs,' further implying a positive, in-group context.The '[SENT]' in the first sentence refers to a drive looking good, which is likely about the in-group team (Seahawks). 'Diggs' in the second and third sentences is a reference to Quandre Diggs, a Seahawks player, indicating it should be tagged [IN]. 'Our offense' indicates it is the in-group's offense (since the commenter is a Seahawks supporter), and thus should be tagged [IN].

'Gesicki' is also a player for the Dolphins. Therefore, 'the coaches' and 'Gesicki' should be tagged [IN] as they both refer to the in-group. This demonstrates the commenter holding their own team accountable rather than blaming opposing players or coaches.	The commenter is discussing an issue that they attribute to the coaches and a specific player, Gesicki, which suggests an incident involving their own team, the Dolphins. When a fan criticizes specific aspects of the game like coaching decisions and individual player mistakes, it is typically in reference to their own team rather than the opponent. Therefore, 'the coaches' and 'Gesicki' should both be tagged as [IN], since they are related to the in-group team (the Dolphins) the commenter supports.	1635705119.0	dolphins	bills	BearlyAlivee		1.0	0.22299635410308805	[5, 5]

Therefore, "cleveland" should be tagged as [OTHER], which is reflected in the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS.	This comment expresses dislike for Cleveland, which is a city whose team (the Cleveland Browns) is neither the in-group (Steelers) nor the out-group (Raiders) for the commenter. Therefore, 'Cleveland' should be tagged as [OTHER] since it refers to some other team in the NFL that is not the opponent.	1632074253.0	steelers	raiders	Fuseld	:Never1::Never2: Never say never but... never	1.0	0.56874692440033	[5]

[SENT] Can fans at the game please try to start a " [IN] " chant or some shit to make up for last week ? 	['Mac , Mac , Mac']	[(52, 67)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is asking fans to chant for 'Mac', which is a reference to Mac Jones, the quarterback for the Patriots, who is the in-group team the commenter supports. The phrase 'Mac, Mac, Mac' is a direct reference to an in-group player, which is intended to motivate or support the team. The win probability indicates that the Patriots are currently losing, possibly trying to rally support from fans to uplift the team's spirit. Hence, 'Mac, Mac, Mac' should be tagged with [IN] since it is referring to a player from the in-group team.	The comment is asking fans to chant "Mac, Mac, Mac," which directly refers to Mac Jones, the quarterback for the Patriots, the in-group team the commenter supports. By suggesting a chant for an in-group player's name, it's clear the commenter is a Patriots fan looking for ways to boost morale after a disappointing performance in the previous week. Therefore, 'Mac, Mac, Mac' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group player.	1667147485.0	patriots	jets	clootinclout	:3-28:	-1.0	0.401231646537781	[5]

['him']	[(30, 33)]	['[IN]']	The comment is expressing a desire for a certain player, indicated by "him," which is likely someone associated with the in-group team that the commenter supports, in this case, the Vikings. Despite the win probability being 0.0%, suggesting that the Vikings are almost certainly going to lose, it does not change the fact that the commenter is viewing the praised player as part of their in-group. Therefore, 'him' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player that everyone supposedly wants.	The comment likely refers to an in-group player using 'him'. Given that the commenter supports the Vikings, and the comment doesn't specify who 'him' is but states "everyone wants him," it can be inferred that 'him' refers to a desirable player from the Vikings. Therefore, 'him' should be tagged as [IN] since it implicitly refers to an in-group player.	1663643247.0	vikings	eagles	BaeGuevara11		1.0	0.00045835971832297595	[5]

Since Christian Watson is a wide receiver for the Packers, the in-group team, 'WATSON' should be tagged as [IN] as it refers to an in-group player. Additionally, 'HES' is referring to Watson and should also be tagged with [IN]. Despite the low win probability for the in-group team, the comment itself is focused on a positive moment for the in-group, reflected in the way the commenter enthusiastically urges everyone to pay attention. Hence, both 'WATSON' and 'HES' should be tagged [IN], making the target and referring expressions correct.	The commenter is excited about a play made by Watson, who is a player for the in-group team (Packers). The enthusiasm ('EVERYONE GET IN HERE NOW') suggests the commenter is celebrating a positive event for their team. Thus, 'WATSON' and 'HES' (he's) should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group player Watson from the Packers.	1669600897.0	packers	eagles	xxthinkpositive	:GB:	25.0	0.21159239113330797	[5, 5]

The win probability for the in-group team, the Broncos, is low, indicating they are likely losing. The comment 'Play like a raven apparently' is likely a sarcastic remark, suggesting the Broncos are playing in a way that resembles the Ravens' style, which implies that the Broncos are not performing well. Therefore, 'raven' is tagged as [OUT] because it refers to the opponent team, the Ravens.	The phrase 'Play like a raven' directly refers to a raven, and since the Ravens are the out-group team for the commenter, 'raven' should be tagged as [OUT]. This captures that the comment is about how the Ravens play, which the commenter identifies as the opposing team.	1633297760.0	broncos	ravens	cyrusthemarginal	Lord Elway	1.0	0.189340531826019	[5]

Commenters often use nicknames or casual terms when referring to players on their own team, in a complimentary or familiar manner. The statement "really just does what he wants" suggests praise for the player's performance, which is consistent with a high win probability indicating the in-group team is performing well. Thus, "Jefe" should be tagged with [IN], and there are no other explicit words/phrases referring to in-group, out-group, or other groups in this comment.	The term 'Jefe' is a nickname for a player on the in-group team, the 49ers. The phrase "really just does what he wants" suggests a positive assessment, which fans typically use to describe players on the team they support.

Fans often show support for individual players even if the overall game situation is unfavorable. Thus, 'COOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPP' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player, and there are no other entities referred to in the comment.	The extended and enthusiastic shout of "COOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPP" is likely referring to Amari Cooper, who is a player for the in-group team, the Cowboys. Fans often use elongated expressions to show support and excitement for a player from their own team.

Despite this, the commenter expresses concern about something that might negatively impact their team in the future. The pronoun 'us' is typically used by fans to refer to the team they support, indicating a collective identity. Therefore, 'us' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The use of "us" indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, which in this case is the Saints. Fans typically use "us" to refer to their in-group team, indicating a shared identity and concern over the team's performance. Thus, the word "us" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, and the entire sentence is a commentary on the in-group's potential misfortune.	1667154372.0	saints	raiders	tglott98	Lattimore	3.0	0.89948184043169	[5]

Given the win probability is relatively high for the Bengals (61.3%), it is reasonable to assume that the commenter is praising their own team, the in-group. Since there is no explicit word or phrase that refers to the in-group, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to indicate it is directed at the in-group team.	The phrase 'Hats off!' is usually a gesture of respect or admiration. Since the commenter is acknowledging a positive thing and there are no other entities mentioned, it implies admiration towards the in-group team, the Bengals, as fans typically praise their own team or players for good performance. Thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because the phrase is implicitly referring to the in-group.	1671406135.0	bengals	buccaneers	Phillyfunbags		1.0	0.6125339269638059	[5]

The term "defense" is used without qualification, which typically indicates a reference to the in-group team. The win probability is low, suggesting that the in-group is in a tough situation, and the commenter is likely expressing their hope for a change in the game's momentum. Therefore, "defense" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter is imploring their defense to make a stop, which indicates they are addressing their in-group team. The use of 'defense' without any further specification suggests it is the defense of the team they support, the Cardinals.

The use of "we" indicates a sense of belonging or identification with the team the commenter supports, which is the Packers. The win probability for the Packers is moderately high, suggesting they are doing relatively well, which aligns with the positive sentiment of the comment. Therefore, "we" should be tagged as [IN] to signal that the commenter is referring to their own team, the Packers.	The usage of 'we' in the comment usually indicates the commenter is referring to the team they support, which is the in-group. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the Packers.

Given the context, it's likely referring to a significant incident involving a player from the opposing team. In NFL fan culture, it's common for fans to show sportsmanship by expressing concern for injured opponents, so "him" is tagged as [OUT]. The win probability is still relatively low for the Lions, indicating the game is not going well for them, but this statement transcends the current game status and focuses on the well-being of a player from the opposing team. Therefore, "him" should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to an out-group player.	The comment's tone suggests concern for someone injured or in distress. Given the context, it is more likely for a fan to express concern for an out-group player's injury, especially if there hasn't been an indication that the in-group player is injured without additional context. 'him' is therefore tagged as [OUT] since the commenter is likely referring to a player from the opposing team, the Packers.	1632189078.0	lions	packers	throw27487		4.0	0.38865739107132	[3]

The win probability is below 50%, indicating that the Saints are likely struggling, which aligns with the critical tone of the comment. Therefore, "this team" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team supported by the commenter.	The phrase 'this team' is used without specification, implying it refers to the team the commenter is currently focused on, which is the in-group (Saints) since the commenter would typically only criticize their own team in such a direct manner.

The first sentence with no explicit entity mentions, but given the negativity, can be assumed to refer to the in-group due to the high frustration levels from the commenter. The phrase "I hate hating on a rookie" indicates that the commenter is reluctant to criticize a new or young player from their own team, suggesting an identification with the team, thus "a rookie" and "him" should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to a new player of the in-group. Therefore, the correct TARGET tagged properly distinguishes between general frustration and specific criticism of an in-group player's performance.Thus, the word 'rookie' and 'him' in the second sentence should also be tagged as [IN], as the commenter is lenient about criticizing them despite not seeing satisfactory performance, referring to someone from the Packers.Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged [IN] because it reflects frustration about the in-group team, and 'a rookie' and 'him' are tagged [IN] because they refer to a player from the in-group.	The tone of frustration and criticism ('Just .... just dog shit ...') is coming from a fan who is likely disappointed in their own team's performance. The sentence without an explicit reference ('Just .... just dog shit ...') reflects an expression of dissatisfaction with their own team and should be tagged [IN]. The statement 'I hate hating on a rookie, but I've seen nothing from him' indicates a reluctance to criticize a young player on their own team. 'a rookie' and 'him' are both referring to the same player on the in-group team, the Packers. Hence, they should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to entities within the in-group that the commenter supports.	1639368063.0	packers	bears	Nofnvalue21	:52:	2.0	0.963201906532049	[5, 5, 5]

The phrase "keeping the Falcon's drive alive" indicates that these mistakes are allowing the Falcons (the out-group) to continue their offensive push. Despite the relatively high win probability for the in-group (49ers), the commenter is focusing on a specific negative play or series of plays. 'Falcon' should be tagged [OUT] because it refers to the opposing team benefiting from the in-group's mistakes. Therefore, the entity 'Falcon' is correctly identified and tagged as [OUT].	The commenter is frustrated about missed tackles and penalties, which are negative aspects typically attributed to the in-group's performance. Since the comment mentions "Falcon's drive," it indicates that these mistakes are allowing the out-group (Falcons) to continue their offensive play. Therefore, "Falcon" should be tagged [OUT] as it clearly refers to the out-group opponent. The sentence implicitly refers to the in-group's errors but does not explicitly mention the in-group; hence, the reference tag for the in-group is not required.	1639950365.0	49ers	falcons	ccastro425	:jerseyhome19: Deebo Samuel	7.0	0.74229097366333	[5]

Given the context, the commenter is likely talking about their own team since they endorse this style, in spite of the Eagles' low win probability in this game against the Panthers. The phrase 'd team' is thus implicitly referring to the in-group team, the Eagles. Hence, it deserves the [IN] tag. The overall comment expresses approval of a defensive strategy, which aligns with how fans often talk about their own team's strengths or desired characteristics. Therefore, the appropriate tagged output and referring expression are 'run first strong [IN] sounds good to me' with 'd team' tagged as [IN]. The comment 'run first strong d team sounds good to me' implicitly refers to the in-group team (Eagles) since 'd team' suggests a desired characteristic of the team the commenter supports, reflecting approval of their playing style. Despite the low win probability, fans tend to emphasize their team's qualities or desired traits. Hence, 'd team' referring to the Eagles should be tagged [IN] making the correct target output and referring expressions.	The commenter is using a positive tone and seems to be describing qualities they approve of for their own team ('sounds good to me'). It is unlikely they would say this about the out-group team, so 'd team' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1633891441.0	eagles	panthers	buttstuff51	My Ball Zach Ertz	3.0	0.10243495553731896	[5]

['the offense']	[(25, 36)]	['[IN]']	The comment expresses frustration and a sense of urgency about the performance of the offense. In this context, "the offense" is in reference to the in-group team, as the commenter is concerned about their own team's ability to close out the game despite a high win probability, which suggests expectations are high. Hence, "the offense" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The phrase 'the offense' refers to the in-group team, which in this case is the Saints. The commenter is expressing frustration about their own team's performance and the need for accountability if the game isn't closed out. Therefore, 'the offense' is tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group. The '[SENT]' token itself encompasses this sentiment and implicitly refers to the in-group, disrupting the need for the out-group in this commentary.	1671396184.0	saints	falcons	_Wado3000	Bounty	4.0	0.895808100700378	[5]

Given the high win probability, the in-group team (Vikings) is likely doing well, making it more plausible that the focus is on their own quarterback's performance. Thus, 'he' should be tagged as [IN] to indicate it refers to the in-group team's quarterback.	The comment is about the in-group quarterback wondering who he will pass to. This is implied by the lack of explicit mention of the out-group team and the context of fans typically discussing their own team's strategic decisions. Thus, 'he' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group quarterback (Vikings).	1631469413.0	vikings	bengals	dakerson1234		1.0	0.751274108886719	[5]

The in-group is the Eagles, who are often referred to as "birds," reflecting their team mascot. The high win probability suggests the Eagles are doing well, which means 'this guy' is likely a positive reference to an Eagles player creating excitement or making a significant play. Since there isn't an explicit mention of the Eagles other than the word 'birds,' the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group. '[SENT]' should therefore be tagged with '[IN]' as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The word 'birds' likely refers to the in-group team, the Eagles, because "Eagles" is a type of bird and fans often use such nicknames to refer to their team. The sentence, although vague, seems to be discussing a player from the in-group (Eagles), but without directly mentioning any specific entity. Thus the entire sentence should be tagged with [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group team.	1676250233.0	eagles	chiefs	RepresentativeAir735	:eagles: Eagles	1.0	0.736999064683914	[5]

The word 'we' almost always refers to the in-group, and here it indicates the desire for the Broncos (in-group) to accommodate Peyton Manning. The statement "I miss that man playing" suggests nostalgia for Peyton Manning's time with the Broncos. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN], and 'Peyton' should also be tagged [IN], as he was a player for the Broncos, which is the in-group team. The win probability being high suggests the Broncos are doing well, but the commenter is reflecting on past players rather than the current game situation.	The commenter uses the word 'we', which typically refers to the in-group team they support. 'Peyton' refers to Peyton Manning, who is a well-known former player for the Broncos (the in-group). The comment expresses a nostalgic sentiment towards Manning and implies a connection to the Broncos.

The directive to not give Rodgers any time suggests that the commenter views him as a significant threat to the 49ers' current advantageous position, as indicated by the relatively high win probability (73.9%). Since Rodgers is a key player for the out-group opponent (Packers), 'RODGERS' is correctly tagged as [OUT]. The comment does not directly refer to any players or entities related to the in-group team (49ers) nor does it mention any third-party teams, so there are no other tags necessary.	The commenter is urging their team not to give any time to Rodgers, who is the quarterback for the Packers. Since Rodgers is a player for the out-group (Packers), he should be tagged with [OUT]. The comment is implicitly about the in-group's strategy against the out-group, but the only explicit entity mentioned is Rodgers, who is part of the out-group. Therefore, 'RODGERS' is correctly tagged with '[OUT]'.	1642910525.0	49ers	packers	ccastro425	:jerseyhome19: Deebo Samuel	1.0	0.738689184188843	[5]

The comment expresses frustration about a rule infraction where a defensive player was tackled, and such complaints are typically directed towards the actions of the out-group. Although the comment doesn't explicitly mention the out-group, the frustration implies dissatisfaction with an action likely committed by them. Thus, the sentence should be tagged [OUT], referring implicitly to an egregious action probably done by the out-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged [OUT] as it refers implicitly to the out-group.	The comment is likely complaining about a perceived unfair action taken against the in-group's defensive players, implying that the opponent (the out-group) is the one committing the questionable action. Thus, even though there's no specific reference to the out-group, the sentence implicitly criticizes the out-group. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers implicitly to the out-group.	1668987102.0	steelers	bengals	fakingmysuicide		7.0	0.326964318752289	[3]

Here's a detailed breakdown:1. "Shanahan" refers to Kyle Shanahan, the head coach of the 49ers. Since Shanahan is directly associated with the 49ers, this word should be tagged as [OUT].2. "SF" is an abbreviation for San Francisco, the city in which the 49ers are based. Hence, it should be tagged as [OUT] as well.3. "We" refers to the in-group team, which is the Cowboys in this context. Commenters often use "We" to refer to the team they support.4. "them" refers to the 49ers, from whom the commenter suggests the Cowboys should take notes.Given the low win probability for the in-group (30.1%), the commenter is likely frustrated and is suggesting that their team (the Cowboys) should emulate the strategies of the more successful team (the 49ers) in this context.The commenter mentions the 49ers' head coach ("Shanahan") and their location ("SF") as part of the	The commenter mentions 'Shanahan' and 'SF', both of which are associated with the out-group team, the 49ers. 'Shanahan' refers to Kyle Shanahan, the coach of the 49ers, and 'SF' is the commonly used abbreviation for San Francisco, the city home to the 49ers. Therefore, both 'Shanahan' and 'SF' should be tagged as [OUT]. The mention of 'we' in the second sentence is referring to the in-group team, the Cowboys, as the commenter identifies with this group wanting to learn from the out-group. Thus, 'We' should be tagged [IN]. Finally, 'them' in the context of taking notes clearly refers back to the 49ers, making 'them' tagged as [OUT]. Therefore, the given targets and referring expressions correctly reflect the in-group and out-group entities mentioned in the comment.	1642370423.0	cowboys	49ers	PersonBehindAScreen	Dallas Cowboys	1.0	0.300779402256012	[5, 5, 5, 5]

[SENT] [OUT] had their choice of penalties to call . 	['the other db', 'They']	[(11, 23), (44, 48)]	['[OUT]', '[OUT]']	The comment seems to be pointing out penalties that weren't called on the opponent team, in this case, the 49ers. In the first sentence, "the other db" most likely refers to a defensive back (db) from the 49ers. There is an implicit adversarial tone regarding missed penalties, which typically indicates the commenter is pointing out actions of the out-group. Therefore, "the other db" should be tagged as [OUT].In the second sentence, "They" refers back to the team that would benefit from the referees having multiple penalties to choose from, which aligns with the out-group team, the 49ers. As such, "They" should also be properly tagged [OUT].Despite the relatively high win probability for the in-group (Packers), the commenter is not discussing their own team's performance but rather perceived unfair actions by the 49ers' defense, hence the exclusive focus on the opponent team in these sentences.Thus, the words and phrases "the other db" and "They" are correctly tagged as [OUT] because the commenter is describing actions taken by the out-group team.	The commenter is discussing a situation involving defensive backs (db), and it is implied that the out-group (the opponent) committed the penalties since the comment expresses an incident negative towards the other team. 'the other db' refers to a defensive back of the out-group team, and 'They' in the second sentence is used to refer back to the out-group team, hence both should be tagged as [OUT].	1632704165.0	packers	49ers	BetterPops		2.0	0.676574110984802	[5, 5]

The win probability is relatively high, indicating the Bills are probably doing well in the game. The comment uses "we," which is typically used by fans to refer to the in-group, so the sentiment aligns with supporter language. "Josh" likely refers to Josh Allen, the quarterback for the Bills, as he is one of the most recognizable players on the team and often mentioned by fans. Therefore, "Josh" should be tagged as [IN], indicating that he is a member of the in-group team the Bills. This makes the phrase "Josh running downhill right now is the answer" a statement praising the strategy of the Bills, with "Josh" being the specific player referenced from the in-group.	The comment refers to "Josh" running downhill, which is a reference to Josh Allen, the quarterback for the Bills. Since the in-group team is the Bills and Josh Allen plays for them, the expression "Josh" should be tagged with [IN]. The phrase "Can we all agree" implies a discussion among fans or supporters of the Bills, suggesting that this comment is being made by and directed towards in-group members discussing their own team's strategy. Thus, tagging "Josh" as [IN] is appropriate.	1671337788.0	bills	dolphins	AlleycatHaxor	:hamlin:	2.0	0.631637930870056	[5]

This is apparent from the use of "we" without qualification, which commonly indicates the in-group team the commenter supports. Despite the relatively high win probability at the time, the commenter is more focused on the potential challenges the team might face in the playoffs rather than their current performance. Therefore, both instances of "we" refer to the in-group team, the Ravens, indicating worry about how they will fare against tougher opponents. This justifies tagging "we" as [IN] in both occurrences.	The commenter uses 'we' twice, which generally indicates they are referring to the in-group team they support. The concern expressed about playing a real offense in the playoffs and getting 'fucking killed' suggests the commenter is worried about their own team's performance, which typically implies they are talking about the Ravens, their in-group team. Therefore, both instances of 'we' should be tagged [IN].	1672630455.0	ravens	steelers	Desperate-Produce-11		2.0	0.68304517865181	[5, 5]

The first part of the comment, "GB offense doing doing what Dallas offense could n't ...." obviously refers to the Packers (out-group) and Cowboys (in-group) respectively, hence 'GB offense' should be tagged [OUT] and 'Dallas offense' should be tagged [IN].The phrase "we give them another 15 yards" expresses frustration with the in-group team giving a favorable play to the out-group team. The use of "we" indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, which is the Cowboys (in-group). Therefore, "we" should be tagged [IN]. "them" in this context refers to the Packers (out-group), as the Cowboys are giving 15 yards to the opposing team.Therefore:- 'GB offense' is tagged [OUT].- 'Dallas offense' is tagged [IN].- 'we' is tagged [IN].- 'them' is tagged [OUT].	The comment contrasts the performance of the Packers' (GB) offense favorably against the Cowboys' (Dallas) offense, which is something a fan of the Cowboys would notice and point out. Given this context:s- 'GB offense' refers to the Packers, the opponent team, and should therefore be tagged with [OUT].- 'Dallas offense' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, the Cowboys, and should be tagged with [IN].- 'we' implicitly refers to the in-group, as the commenter is lamenting their own team's performance or decisions, so it should be tagged with [IN].- 'them' refers to the Packers, indicating the yards given to the opponent, so it should be tagged with [OUT].	1668375159.0	cowboys	packers	chexmixho		1.0	0.540332168340683	[5, 5, 5, 5]

The context suggests frustration with an in-group defensive lapse, leading to Cooper being left wide open in a critical moment of the game. Given the low win probability, the commenter seems exasperated and sarcastically recommends to "Fire everyone" from their team. Thus, "cooper" should be tagged as [OUT] because the commenter supports the Buccaneers, and Amari Cooper plays for the Browns, which is the out-group in this scenario. The rest of the sentence does not explicitly mention any entities but refers implicitly to the in-group's failure on defense; however, the tag needed for "cooper" is sufficient to illustrate the comment's focal point.	The comment expresses frustration about a player from the out-group team ('cooper') being left wide open, which indicates that the player's action contributed to a negative outcome for the in-group team. The commenter is upset, most likely with their own team's defensive performance. Therefore, 'cooper' should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to a player from the Browns, the out-group opponent.	1669584324.0	buccaneers	browns	okaycomputes	:bradyflag: Tom Brady	16.0	0.10477881936822098	[5]

Since "Ravens" is the explicit name of the out-group, it should be tagged [OUT]. "Offence" is implicitly referring to the Jets' offense, which is the in-group team, so it is tagged [IN]. The win probability for the in-group is low (14.0%), indicating the Jets are currently losing or in a precarious position, which aligns with the concern expressed in the comment.	The commenter mentions two teams in this sentence. 'Ravens' refers to the out-group opponent team, so it should be tagged [OUT]. 'Offence' refers to the in-group team (Jets) since the commenter is worried about their own team's offense not performing well, which could lead to the Ravens scoring. Therefore, 'offence' should be tagged [IN].	1662920031.0	jets	ravens	SnooDoggos6525		1.0	0.140460312366486	[5, 5]

The presence of two players from the in-group team implies that the comment is focusing on in-group personnel. Given the context, the comment likely expresses dissatisfaction or concern about being down by 2 points despite the presence of these players, reflected by the low win probability. Therefore, 'Collins' and 'Bostic' should be tagged with [IN], since they refer to members of the in-group team.	Collins and Bostic are both players for the Washington Commanders. Since the commenter supports the Commanders, these players are part of the in-group. Thus, 'Collins' and 'Bostic' should be tagged with [IN].	1632676351.0	commanders	bills	bam3339	Fuck Dan Snyder	2.0	0.14703678289196997	[5, 5]

The win probability of 66.3% indicates the Dolphins are likely doing well in the game overall, but this specific comment focuses on a challenging moment for Gesicki, possibly hinting at his struggles despite the favorable game situation. Since "Gesicki" is a member of the in-group team, he should be tagged with [IN]. The rest of the sentence does not explicitly refer to any group, but implicitly the coverage is being provided by the out-group (Ravens), though they aren't mentioned directly.	The commenter mentions "Gesicki," who is a player for the Dolphins, the in-group team. Since the comment is expressing concern about Gesicki being "smothered in coverage," it shows attention to a player from the team the commenter supports. Therefore, "Gesicki" should be tagged [IN] as he is a member of the in-group with respect to the commenter.	1636689015.0	dolphins	ravens	washingtonduke	17	5.0	0.663281500339508	[5]

[IN] can't cover worth a shit 	['Packers', 'they', '9ers defense']	[(7, 14), (48, 52), (67, 79)]	['[OUT]', '[OUT]', '[IN]']	The comment discusses both the Packers and the 49ers within the context of their NFL game. The first sentence, "Packers just need to keep throwing it if they wanna win ..." is focused on what the Packers, the out-group team, need to do to win. Therefore, "Packers" and "they" are tagged as [OUT]. The second part of the comment, "9ers defense can't cover worth a shit," criticizes the defensive performance of the 49ers, the in-group team, aligning with the lower win probability of the in-group. Thus, "9ers defense" is tagged as [IN]. Given that both the positive action (throwing) and negative criticism (defense not covering) are very likely to target their respective groups, the tags accurately reflect the sentiment and context of the comment.	The commenter refers to both the Packers and 49ers explicitly. 'Packers' is the opposing team, so it should be tagged as [OUT]. The word 'they' is a pronoun referring to the Packers, and thus it should also be tagged as [OUT]. '9ers defense' refers to the in-group team, the 49ers, which the commenter supports, so it should be tagged as [IN]. The negative comment about the 49ers' defense indicates frustration with the in-group team, reinforcing that '9ers defense' refers to the in-group.	1632710330.0	49ers	packers	dublife73	:jerseyhome05: Trey Lance	18.0	0.188052462483869	[5, 5, 5]

The win probability is slightly in favor of the in-group, which means the game is in a relatively favorable state for the Bills at the time of the comment. Since there are no explicit words or phrases identifying a specific entity, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to signify that the whole sentence is implicitly celebrating the in-group team's success.	The comment 'Yes' likely represents a positive reaction to something that happened in favor of the in-group team, which is the Bills. Since there are no explicit words or phrases that refer to the Bills, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to indicate that the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group team.	1642992783.0	bills	chiefs	lionheart4life		1.0	0.5482145118298309	[5]

['Special Teams', 'us', 'This team']	[(15, 28), (36, 38), (53, 62)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment expresses disappointment with the in-group team's performance, hinting at their low win probability. The phrase "Special Teams" refers to a sub-group within the in-group team, criticized for letting down the team and its fans. "us" is a pronoun often used by fans to refer to themselves and their in-group collectively, indicating that the commenter is speaking about their own team. The phrase "This team" also refers to the in-group, reflecting the sentiment of frustration the commenter feels towards the team they support.Therefore, 'Special Teams' and 'us' should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to the in-group. 'This team' should also be tagged with [IN] for the same reason. The context is clearly about the underperformance of the commenter's own team (the Panthers), given their very low win probability.	The commenter is expressing frustration with the performance of their team. 'Special Teams' likely refers to a specific unit of the in-group team as it is mentioned without qualification, suggesting familiarity and a sense of ownership. 'us' is inclusively used to denote the commenter, plus others who support the same in-group team. 'This team' further solidifies the reference to the in-group, conveying the relationship and emotional investment typically associated with a team the commenter supports.

This indicates the commenter's focus on particular issues regardless of the overall game state. 1. 'the defense' - This term is likely referring to the in-group's defense, as the comment is critical of it without any indication it's about the out-group.2. 'Staley' - Brandon Staley is the head coach of the Chargers, so 'Staley' should be tagged [IN].3. 'this defense' - Similar to 'the defense', 'this defense' refers to the Chargers' defense that the commenter supports.4. 'They' - The antecedent here is 'the defense' from the previous sentence, logically referring to the in-group's defense.5. 'Steelers' - Explicitly referring to the out-group.Thus, 'the defense', 'Staley', 'this defense', and 'They' should be tagged [IN], while 'Steelers' should be tagged [OUT] in the context of the comment.	The commenter's negative tone and bewilderment about the performance of 'the defense' and the efforts of 'Staley' indicate that they are talking about their own team, the Chargers (in-group), who are struggling. The reference to 'the defense' without any qualifying adjective implies it refers to their own team's defense; thus, 'the defense' should be tagged as [IN]. Staley is a known coach for the Chargers, so 'Staley' and 'this defense' should be tagged as [IN]. In the third sentence, 'They' refers back to 'the defense' mentioned earlier, which we've established is the in-group (Chargers), so 'They' should be tagged as [IN]. Finally, 'Steelers' directly refers to the out-group team and should therefore be tagged as [OUT].	1637554222.0	chargers	steelers	Sherbert199621		2.0	0.936807482172586	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

['D', 'RT17']	[(10, 11), (34, 38)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	The commenter is discussing a defensive play. The win probability for the Dolphins is low, indicating that the team is losing and needs to change the situation. 'D' is an abbreviation for 'Defense,' which commonly refers to the in-group's defense, especially in the absence of other qualifying information. 'RT17' is likely referring to the quarterback of the Titans, Ryan Tannehill, who wears jersey number 17. Therefore, 'D' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team (Dolphins), and 'RT17' should be tagged with [OUT] as it refers to the quarterback of the opposing team (Titans).	The comment is referring to the defensive capability of the in-group team ('Ok D'), implying that the commenter is looking for the Dolphins' defense to step up. 'D' here refers to the defense of the in-group and should be tagged with [IN]. Additionally, 'RT17' refers to Titans' quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who wears jersey number 17. Since he is part of the out-group opponent team, 'RT17' should be tagged with [OUT].	1641149946.0	dolphins	titans	cooljazz	13	8.0	0.16475449502468098	[5, 5]

'Doing this against one of the worst teams' implies a poor performance from the in-group against a less formidable opponent, which is the Lions in this context. The phrase 'Kill me now' reflects the commenter's frustration and is implicitly related to the in-group's performance without explicitly mentioning them, which is why '[SENT]' is not tagged in the second sentence. Therefore, the first sentence should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the out-group being labeled as one of the worst teams, reflecting poorly on the in-group's performance against them. 'Doing this' and 'one of the worst teams in the league' implicitly refer to the out-group (Lions) without explicitly naming them, so the entirety of the first sentence is tagged [OUT]. The second sentence expresses frustration but does not have an explicit reference and is left untagged.	The phrase "one of the worst teams in the league" is indicative of the commenter referring to the out-group, which in this context is the Lions, especially given that the commenter supports the Cardinals. This means the in-group is struggling against a team perceived as weaker. The first sentence implicitly refers to the out-group (without a clear referring expression within the sentence), indicating frustration with the in-group's performance, thereby tagging '[OUT]' as aligned with the out-group. The final sentence, "Kill me now," expresses a sentiment of desperation without any specific tags. Therefore, the entire comment attributes the frustration to the context involving the out-group team, the Lions. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]' since the comment implicitly refers to the out-group.	1639940335.0	cardinals	lions	Phxrep		3.0	0.5329991579055791	[5]

The mention of 'offense' refers to the in-group (Falcons) because it is unlikely a fan would be discussing the positive performance of an opponent's player in such detail. Given the high win probability, it aligns with the Falcons being in a favorable position. Therefore, 'Matt' and 'the offense' should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter seems to be happy about how Matt (likely referring to Matt Ryan, a longtime quarterback for the Falcons) is performing and that he looks comfortable in the offense. Given the context, this suggests the commenter is talking about their own team's quarterback and offensive play. Thus, 'Matt' should be tagged [IN] because he is a player for the Falcons, which is the commenter's in-group, and 'the offense' should also be tagged [IN] since it refers to the Falcons' offensive scheme.	1633873561.0	falcons	jets	ItssethL22		2.0	0.6270552277565	[5, 5]

Commenters often praise specific players from their own team even when the team is not performing well in general, and it is common for fans to acknowledge individual efforts regardless of the overall game situation. Jared Goff is a player for the Lions, making him part of the in-group. Thus, 'Goff' is correctly tagged as [IN], referring to the in-group player showing great composure.	The comment praises Goff's composure, implying a positive view which is likely to come from a supporter of the in-group. Jared Goff is the quarterback for the Lions, meaning he belongs to the in-group team the commenter supports. Thus, 'Goff' should be tagged as [IN].	1669313419.0	lions	bills	jbob999		12.0	0.185031950473785	[5]

['Tannehill', 'Tua']	[(71, 80), (101, 104)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	The comment mentions a comparison between two quarterbacks, Tannehill and Tua. Given the context, Tannehill is the quarterback for the out-group team (Titans), and Tua is the quarterback for the in-group team (Dolphins). The commenter is upset about being criticized for making a statement comparing these two players. Since the win probability is extremely low for the in-group, the commenter's frustration with the situation might be exacerbating their reaction. 'Tannehill' is tagged as [OUT] because he is the quarterback for the Titans, which is the out-group team. 'Tua' is tagged as [IN] because he is the quarterback for the Dolphins, the in-group team.Thus, the taggings for 'Tannehill' and 'Tua' are correctly labeled as [OUT] and [IN] respectively.	The commenter is discussing a comparison between Tannehill and Tua. Given the context, the phrase "Tannehill is a better QB than Tua" is a point of contention. Tannehill is currently a quarterback for the Titans (out-group), and Tua is a quarterback for the Dolphins (in-group). The reference to Tannehill should be tagged as [OUT] since he is part of the out-group. Similarly, Tua should be tagged as [IN] since he is part of the in-group the commenter supports. Thus, 'Tannehill' is tagged with [OUT] and 'Tua' with [IN] to correctly identify the groups being referenced.	1641155676.0	dolphins	titans	Yournewhero		-1.0	0.0015088661383040325	[5, 5]

The aggressive language directed at Brady indicates a strong emotional response from the commenter, likely a fan of the Saints, since the comment tries to deride a player from the opposing team. Considering the win probability is very high for the in-group (Saints), the expletive can be seen as a triumphant or mocking response from a fan whose team is doing well. Thus, 'BRADY' should be tagged as [OUT] since he refers to the out-group team.	The commenter expresses hostility towards Brady, who is known to be a player for the Buccaneers, the out-group team in this context. Since Brady is a part of the out-group, 'BRADY' should be tagged with [OUT]. The sentiment implies that the commenter is celebrating or gleefully reacting to some misfortune befalling the out-group's player, aligning with typical in-group critique or schadenfreude towards an out-group entity. Hence, 'BRADY' is correctly tagged as [OUT].	1639973068.0	saints	buccaneers	BriskManeuver	Cardinals	7.0	0.9080591574311256	[5]

Given that the commenter supports the Raiders, and Mack Hollins is a player for the Raiders, he should be tagged as [IN]. This aligns with the context and the win probability being relatively high, suggesting the in-group is doing well, further supporting the positive sentiment towards an in-group player. Therefore, the tag [IN] for "Mack Hollins" is correct.	Mack Hollins is a wide receiver for the Raiders. Since the commenter supports the Raiders, and Mack Hollins is a player for the in-group team, 'Mack Hollins' should be tagged with [IN] as he is a member of the in-group with respect to the commenter.	1666559874.0	raiders	texans	danny18wrx	:Logo_95-Present:	3.0	0.617809838702388	[5]

Given the win probability is slightly in favor of the Jets, but not overwhelmingly, it suggests a competitive game where defensive plays are crucial. Since the commenter is expressing excitement over a defensive success, it implies that the defensive play was by the in-group team (Jets) forcing the out-group team (Steelers) to punt. The phrase does not have any explicit mentioning of the in-group team but implicitly celebrates their defensive success. Thus, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN] because it's talking about the Jets' successful defense.	The comment "3 N OUT BAY BAY" is a reference to a "3-and-out," which is a situation where the offensive team fails to get a first down and must punt after three plays. Given the frustration or negative tone implied by the expression, it is likely the commenter is talking about their own team, the in-group (Jets), struggling to convert. The absence of any explicit reference to the Jets necessitates tagging the entire sentence as [IN], reflecting an implicit frustration with the in-group team's performance. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged as '[IN]' since the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team.	1664731698.0	jets	steelers	BryLinds	:OtherJoeDStoneCold: Stone Cold Joe Douglas	6.0	0.5453551709651949	[5]

AJ Green is a player for the Cardinals, the in-group team. The comment is referencing his performance, likely in a positive light given the phrase "My death was greatly exaggerated," which implies he is performing better than expected. Thus, 'AJ Green' should be tagged [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team. The rest of the comment doesn't contain specific referring expressions related to entities, but implicitly supports AJ Green's good performance, aligning with the high win probability.	AJ Green is a wide receiver for the Cardinals, the in-group team that the commenter supports. The commenter is likely celebrating a strong performance by AJ Green, implying that reports of his decline were premature.

['we', 'the worst team in the league']	[(16, 18), (35, 63)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	The word 'we' almost always refers to the in-group, and here it indicates the team the commenter supports, which is the Chargers. This is supported by the context that the commenter is evaluating their own team's performance. 'the worst team in the league' is referring to the opponent, which in this context is the Texans, indicating they were struggling against what the commenter perceives as an inferior opponent. Thus, 'we' should be tagged [IN] and 'the worst team in the league' should be tagged [OUT]. The comment is implicitly about not feeling confident about the Chargers' win despite the current high win probability, reflecting a critical stance on their performance.	The commenter uses 'we,' which typically refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. Therefore, 'we' is tagged with [IN]. When the commenter mentions 'the worst team in the league,' it refers to the out-group team, in this case, the Texans, as they are the opponent and are being described disparagingly. This expression, therefore, is tagged with [OUT]. The final tagging captures both the reference to the commenter's own team and the opponent accurately within the context.	1664740853.0	chargers	texans	Yankee2121	21/17	3.0	0.9992177486419678	[5, 5]

['they', 'they', 'him']	[(10, 14), (46, 50), (56, 59)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment seems to concern an injury report status, suggesting that the commenter is questioning a decision made by their own team (the Jets) regarding the injury status of a player. The low win probability suggests that the in-group (Jets) is struggling, which can often lead fans to criticize their team's decisions more closely:1. **'they'** - This first instance of 'they' implicitly refers to the decision-makers or medical team of the in-group (Jets), questioning their actions.2. **'they'** - The second instance of 'they' continues to refer to the same in-group team officials as those making the listing decision.3. **'him'** - This could refer to a Jets player who is injured and whose status is being questioned, since the commenter is discussing the listing decision related to an injury.Overall, the questioning tone and the low win probability context suggest that the commenter is frustrated or confused about their own team's actions, reinforcing that these references should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is discussing the handling of an injury, specifically questioning the decision of the team to list a player with an ACL tear as questionable. Given the context and the fact that no specific team is mentioned, it's reasonable to assume that 'they' refers to the in-group, as fans often scrutinize their own team's decisions more closely. Thus, 'they' should be tagged as [IN], reflecting the in-group team (Jets). 'Him' refers to an unnamed player on the in-group team (Jets) whom the commenter is concerned about, so 'him' should also be tagged as [IN].	1635098420.0	jets	patriots	JustDragon		1.0	0.11401695013046298	[5, 5, 5]

Since the in-group is the Saints, and New Orleans is home to the Saints, "number 27 of New Orleans" clearly refers to a player on the in-group team. Despite the relatively high win probability for the in-group, the commenter is focused on a specific negative play involving their team's player. Therefore, "number 27 of New Orleans" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group entity. The second sentence is a neutral statement about the penalty enforcement and doesn't reference any specific team or player explicitly.	The commenter is referencing a penalty called for pass interference against "number 27 of New Orleans." Since New Orleans is the city the in-group team, the Saints, represents, and the context is a call against a specific player from New Orleans, it should be tagged as referring to the in-group. Hence, "number 27 of New Orleans" refers to the in-group and is tagged with [IN]. The second sentence does not provide new information about specific teams or players, so it remains untagged for team references.	1670289277.0	saints	buccaneers	skint_back		4.0	0.614067256450653	[5]

It is common in such contexts for fans to criticize their own team's performance more harshly than they would criticize the opponent's. The use of "we know and love" indicates a familiarity with the subject, which aligns with the commenter speaking about their own team. Despite the low win probability, the negativity is directed towards the in-group team, the Titans. Therefore, "defense" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The comment is expressing frustration towards the defense, which the commenter sarcastically says they "know and love." Given this kind of emotional expression, it strongly suggests criticism towards the team the commenter supports. Thus, 'defense' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Titans, and there are no references to any other teams in the comment. Therefore, the rest of the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group.	1632086473.0	titans	seahawks	JiveHawk	Titans	6.0	0.26618361685537295	[5]

The exclamation "TD!" (touchdown) is a celebratory reaction, typically indicative of the commenter cheering for their team scoring a touchdown. Even though the win probability is low, fans frequently highlight positive events in the game. Given there is no explicit mention of the in-group or out-group in the comment, the assumption is that the commenter is celebrating a touchdown by the team they support. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment implicitly refers to a positive event for the in-group team, the Titans.	The exclamation "TD!" (Touchdown) likely reflects a moment of excitement or celebration. Since fans typically express enthusiasm about their own team scoring a touchdown, this comment is probably celebrating the in-group team's (the Titans') success. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged with [IN], even though there is no explicit mention of the Titans.	1667786794.0	titans	chiefs			1.0	0.09868402034044299	[5]

['They', 'Barr', 'LVE']	[(7, 11), (49, 53), (88, 91)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The in-group team is the Cowboys, evidenced by the win probability being relatively high, indicating they are doing well overall. The commenter is criticizing the team's defensive performance, which suggests a focus on immediate plays rather than the overall game state. 'They' in the first sentence refers to the Cowboys, as fans often use 'they' when talking about their team. 'Barr' refers to Anthony Barr, a linebacker for the Cowboys, supporting the idea that the comment is about in-group players. In the second sentence, 'LVE' refers to Leighton Vander Esch, another Cowboys linebacker, showing a continued in-group context. Thus, all the tagged expressions rightfully refer to the in-group team.	The commenter is discussing the performance of their own team's players and the impact of a specific player's absence. 'They' in the first sentence likely refers to the in-group team's defensive unit given the context of analyzing a defensive play ('screens'). 'Barr' and 'LVE' (Leighton Vander Esch, a known player for the Cowboys) are tagged as [IN] since they are both members of the in-group team (Cowboys) and their performance or absence is being scrutinized. Thus, 'They', 'Barr', and 'LVE' are accurately tagged as referring to the in-group, and '[IN]' tags appropriately reflect the context across the sentences.	1671389565.0	cowboys	jaguars	maztron		1.0	0.81497548692613	[5, 5, 5]

['Boyer', 'You']	[(20, 25), (35, 38)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The name 'Boyer' refers to Josh Boyer, who was the defensive coordinator for the Miami Dolphins. Since the in-group team is the Dolphins, the frustration in the comment is directed towards a member of the in-group coaching staff. Given the explicit mention of 'Boyer' and the use of 'You,' both are referring to an in-group entity. Despite the win probability being almost even, the comment shows dissatisfaction with the in-group's performance or decisions, indicating that 'Boyer' and 'You' should be tagged with [IN].	Boyer is the current defensive coordinator for the Dolphins. The commenter is blaming him for something negative, which implies they are frustrated with the performance of someone from their own team. Thus, 'Boyer' in the first sentence and 'You' in the second sentence should be tagged with [IN], as both refer to a member of the in-group.	1673210018.0	dolphins	jets	ahappylittlecloud		2.0	0.507707089185715	[5, 5]

The use of 'embarrassing performance' is in a negative context, and fans commonly criticize their own team when they are underperforming. Thus, 'd' is likely short for 'defense' referring to the Eagles' defensive unit, and should be tagged [IN]. The ambiguous 'They' at the start of the sentence can be tricky, but it most likely refers to the Eagles given that the commenter is speaking negatively about the defensive performance right after. Hence, 'They' should also be tagged with [IN].	The comment likely refers to the in-group team (Eagles) running out the clock, which is typically a strategy employed when a team is leading or securing a win. The phrase "what an embarrassing performance by d" suggests the commenter is disappointed with the defensive performance of their own team, indicating a critique of the in-group defense. Therefore, "They" in the first sentence and "d" in the second sentence should be tagged with [IN], as both refer to the in-group.	1676257295.0	eagles	chiefs	IamArrogant		11.0	0.364224314689636	[5, 5]

The high win probability indicates that the team is likely doing well overall, but the commenter is focusing on Jeudy's individual performance and criticizing him by calling him a "bust". This kind of criticism typically comes from a supporter who is frustrated with a player on their own team, rather than an opponent or an unrelated team. Therefore, "Jeudy" should be tagged with [IN], since it refers to a player from the in-group team.	The comment 'Jeudy is a bust' is disparaging a player named Jeudy. Jerry Jeudy is a wide receiver for the Denver Broncos, which is the in-group team that the commenter supports. Fans often criticize their own team's players when they perform poorly, so 'Jeudy' refers to an in-group player. Therefore, 'Jeudy' should be tagged with [IN] and the overall sentence should be tagged as referring to the in-group.	1665105481.0	broncos	colts	Faunatics		12.0	0.822489798069	[5]

The win probability is relatively low, indicating that the Eagles are losing, which is likely why the commenter is using such a disparaging term. Despite the negative tone, fans often use such language towards their own team when they are frustrated with poor performance. Therefore, "Fraudadelphia Fraudles" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team. The term "ladies and gentlemen" does not refer to a team, so it does not need to be tagged.	The phrase "Fraudadelphia Fraudles" is a derogatory term combining "Philadelphia" with "Fraud," indicative of a negative nickname often created by fans for rival teams. However, the commenter supports the Eagles, making it a self-deprecating comment aimed at their own team. This style of critique or sarcastic humor is common among fans upset with their in-group team's performance.

When a team is doing well, fans often express pride or satisfaction with their own team's performance, using terms like "cooking" to describe their successful plays. The term "Offense" is used without any additional qualifiers, suggesting that the commenter is talking about their own team's offensive performance. Therefore, "Offense" should be tagged [IN], since it refers to the Chargers' offense.	The comment 'Offense is cooking today' is likely made by a supporter who is praising their own team's offensive performance. Since there is no qualifier, it is reasonable to assume the 'Offense' being referred to belongs to the in-group team, the Chargers. Fans typically highlight their own team's positive performances with such comments.

Since the Packers is the in-group supported by the commenter and the Eagles is the out-group, 'the guy' is referring to the player from the opposing team (Eagles) and 'the eagles' clearly points to the opposing team as well. The win probability for the Packers is very low, indicating they are likely losing, which often prompts comments on the opposing team or players. Thus, 'the guy' and 'the eagles' should be tagged with [OUT] since they refer to an out-group player and team respectively.	The comment refers to a specific player on the Eagles, the out-group team. The phrase "the guy" denotes the player with the #69 jersey named "Dickerson" and is a lighthearted remark made by the commenter. Since the player and the team mentioned (the Eagles) are part of the out-group, "the guy" refers to the out-group player, and "the eagles" refers to the out-group team. The comment is entirely focused on this player and team, without mentioning or implying anything about the in-group (Packers) team. Thus, it is appropriate to tag "the guy" and "the eagles" with [OUT] as they both refer to the out-group.	1669608184.0	packers	eagles			3.0	0.026772519573568965	[5, 5]

DeAndre Hopkins does not play for the Commanders (in-group) or their opponent, Washington (out-group), so he must be from another team. Thus, "Hopkins" should be tagged as [OTHER]. The low win probability suggests the Commanders are not doing well, which might explain why the commenter is wishing for a player of Hopkins' caliber. Therefore, "Hopkins" should be tagged [OTHER] since he's not part of either the in-group or out-group team.	The commenter expresses a wish to have a player like Hopkins, who is not part of either the in-group team (Commanders) or the out-group team (Washington), meaning they are referring to a player from another team. This indicates that the player being referred to is from an unspecified other team. Therefore, 'Hopkins' should be tagged as [OTHER]. Furthermore, 'we' in this context implicitly refers to the in-group team, but since there is no explicit reference, it does not require tagging.	1666549711.0	commanders	washington	PocketSandThroatKick	:GoldW:	1.0	0.200927257537842	[5]

The low win probability indicates that the team is currently losing or struggling, and the fan is likely trying to avoid further mistakes in a critical situation by asking Boyd to fair catch the ball. This aligns with fans frequently directing pleas and instructions to their own players, thus 'Boyd' should be tagged [IN] as he is a member of the in-group team.	'Boyd' refers to a player for the Bengals, the in-group team that the commenter supports. The commenter is making a specific request to the player, indicating familiarity and support, which fans would typically only do for players on the team they support. Therefore, 'Boyd' should be tagged as [IN].	1639353768.0	bengals	49ers	lmaoitsdusey		5.0	0.155833438038826	[5]

['McD', 'Frazier', 'Daboll']	[(84, 87), (119, 126), (185, 191)]	['[IN]', '[OTHER]', '[OTHER]']	The comment is about changes in coaching/play-calling for the Bills after halftime. Given the perfect 100% win probability, it's likely the game is decided in favor of the in-group, the Bills. 'McD' refers to Sean McDermott, the head coach of the Bills, so it should be tagged [IN]. 'Frazier' (Leslie Frazier, former Bills defensive coordinator) and 'Daboll' (Brian Daboll, former Bills offensive coordinator) are not currently part of the in-group coaching staff but are instead referred to as former members of the Bills' coaching committee. Even though Frazier and Daboll are associated with the Bills, they are not involved in the present context; hence, they are tagged [OTHER].	The commenter is talking about changes in play calling by the Bills, with 'McD', 'Frazier', and 'Daboll' being specific individuals associated with the Bills. Since the commenter supports the Bills (the in-group) and is discussing internal changes within the Bills' coaching staff, 'McD' should be tagged [IN] as he is a member of the in-group. 'Frazier' and 'Daboll' are also part of the Bills organization, and therefore should be tagged [OTHER] because they are not directly part of the coaching change being discussed in relation to 'McD' after halftime but are still part of the wider context of the team.	1639357625.0	bills	buccaneers	MILLERRRR	Sabres	5.0	1.0	[5, 5, 5]

['him']	[(29, 32)]	['[OUT]']	The commenter is speaking about an opposing player, describing his height in a somewhat mocking or critical manner. In the context of American football, it is common to discuss penalties or hits related to opposing players, especially if the comment is made somewhat derisively. Given that the Rams are the in-group and the win probability is low, it suggests frustration, which is often directed at the opponent. Therefore, 'him' should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to an out-group player from the Cardinals team.	The comment refers to a player being hit high, and the context does not suggest frustration or support for one's own team, indicating it is about the out-group. 'him' is the only noun phrase referring to an entity, and since the complaint is about the difficulty of not hitting high due to the player's height, it is a likely reference to an opponent. Thus 'him' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to a member of the out-group team.	1633297257.0	rams	cardinals	BlksnshN80		8.0	0.143601536750793	[5]

['they', 'us']	[(76, 80), (90, 92)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	The win probability for the in-group Chiefs is extremely low at 0.8%, indicating they are very likely losing the game against the Bills. This aligns with the context of the commenter's message.In the first sentence, the commenter reflects on their initial expectations without explicitly mentioning either team, so there is no need for tagging.In the second sentence, the commenter mentions "they" and "us." Given that "us" typically refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, it should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the Chiefs. Meanwhile, "they" refers to the opponent team who managed to score against the Chiefs, thus it should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the Bills.Therefore, the referring expression 'they' should be tagged [OUT] and 'us' should be tagged [IN] based on these reasons. This makes the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS correct, as they accurately reflect the entities' roles in-group, out-group, and other within the comment context.	The comment indicates that the commenter had low expectations for their team's performance and is surprised that the opposing team has only managed a single success. 'they' in the second sentence refers to the out-group (Bills), as it implies the actions of the opponent in the game. 'us' in the same sentence refers to the commenter's team, the in-group (Chiefs), expressing the results of the opponent's performance against them. Thus, 'they' should be tagged [OUT] and 'us' should be tagged [IN].	1665957638.0	chiefs	bills	Dzov	Chris Jones #95	1.0	0.008476972579956	[5, 5]

[SENT] After 15 weeks you just sort of expect this to happen with [IN] 	['this trash ass team']	[(109, 128)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is expressing frustration and resignation towards a team performing poorly over a long period ("After 15 weeks"). Given the context and language used (such as "trash ass team"), it is highly likely that the commenter is lamenting the performance of their own team, the Raiders, which aligns with the 58.6% win probability indicating a moderate chance of winning but not necessarily reflecting confidence or satisfaction. The phrase "this trash ass team" likely refers to the in-group team, the Raiders, due to the negative sentiment common in fans' expressions of frustration towards their own team. Thus, 'this trash ass team' should be tagged as [IN], referring to the in-group (Raiders). The rest of the comment does not contain specific references to the out-group or any other team, and the frustration seems internally directed.	The commenter is expressing frustration and resignation about their team's performance, indicating it is the team they support. 'this trash ass team' refers to the in-group team, the Raiders. Fans are far more likely to talk about their own team this way, especially in negative terms, and '[IN]' correctly tags 'this trash ass team' because it refers to the in-group. The second sentence's overall tone of expectation and disappointment implies it is about the ongoing performance issues with the in-group team. The first sentence is a general question and does not reference any specific team, so it is left untagged.	1671405879.0	raiders	patriots	adonisgawd	:Logo_63:	6.0	0.586109459400177	[5]

"a bad roster" implicitly refers to the in-group (Bears) since it is mentioned without qualification, suggesting that the commenter blames their team's poor performance on their roster. Similarly, "the coaches" should also refer to the Bears as the commenter is calling for accountability from their team's coaching staff. Therefore, both "a bad roster" and "the coaches" should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the in-group.	The comment is critiquing the performance in a game and calling for accountability, which strongly suggests criticism towards the in-group team. The term 'a bad roster' is an indirect critique of the in-group team (Bears), as fans don't usually criticize the opponent's roster in a manner that implies required accountability. Similarly, 'the coaches' refers to the in-group's coaching staff since the expectation for accountability would be directed at the team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'a bad roster' and 'the coaches' should both be tagged as [IN].	1672603725.0	bears	lions	nfloos		10.0	0.00036752223968494757	[5, 5]

The commenter is pointing out that kickers are a weakness for JD, implicitly referring to the in-group team's performance in that area. Since JD is associated with the Jets and the comment is addressing his weakness, 'JD' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group.	The comment is discussing 'JD' and his perceived weakness. Given the context of an NFL game and the teams involved (Jets as the in-group), 'JD' likely refers to someone associated with the Jets, such as their coach Joe Douglas. Thus, 'JD' should be tagged [IN] as it denotes a member of the in-group. The complaint about 'Kickers' being a weakness implies a critique of the in-group team's performance, further reinforcing that 'JD' is associated with the Jets. Therefore, tagging 'JD' as [IN] is appropriate.	1641155579.0	jets	buccaneers	haho5		3.0	0.441615164279938	[5]

['we']	[(12, 14)]	['[IN]']	The commenter uses the term 'we' which almost always refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports in sports contexts. Here, 'we' indicates the Packers, the in-group team. They are lamenting their lack of linebackers (LBs), suggesting concern for their own team's immediate future despite a relatively high win probability. Thus, 'we' should be tagged with [IN]. The second sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team as well, asserting that the situation will worsen. This concern likely stems from the perceived deficiency mentioned in the first sentence, aligning with the in-group team's perspective. As such, it is appropriate that no explicit new tag is needed for the second sentence since the context established by the first sentence continues into the second.	The phrase 'we' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, which in this case is the Packers. Fans typically use 'we' to refer to their own team. The second sentence, 'This is gonna get ugly,' speaks to the continuation of the situation without needing to specify the team again, but it is a commentary on the current state of their own team. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it denotes the in-group, the Packers.	1633293802.0	packers	steelers	GreenIsG00d		5.0	0.606324404478073	[5]

However, given that the win probability is quite low for the in-group (Steelers), it seems likely that the commenter is expressing frustration or a resigned sentiment about a challenging period for the team, possibly suggesting it has been a tough few years for the Steelers. Since there are no explicit words or phrases that refer to the in-group or out-group, the entire sentence segment can be implicitly tagged as referring to the in-group. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN].	The lack of context in the comment makes it difficult to determine a clear in-group, out-group, or other reference from the provided tokens. However, among fans talking about their teams, short fragments like "* few years" typically exist in the context of discussions about their own team's performance over time. The use of this fragment indicates a likely conversation about the in-group (Steelers in this case) potentially reflecting on past performance or projections. Thus, the entire sentence is tagged as [IN], and since no explicit referring expression exists, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN].	1670791592.0	steelers	ravens	mcsharp		0.0	0.112321615219116	[5]

The pronoun "we" typically denotes the in-group team, especially in fan commentary where fans refer to their team as "we." Given the low win probability, the commenter seems to be expressing frustration or a hypothetical scenario favoring the in-group. Thus, "we" should be tagged with [IN], as it clearly refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, which is the Broncos.	The usage of 'we' in the comment usually denotes the in-group since fans typically use this pronoun to refer to the team they support. The commenter is a Broncos fan, so 'we' should be tagged [IN], as it implies they are discussing their own team's performance on offense.	1638759574.0	broncos	chiefs			2.0	0.08137267827987704	[5]

['we']	[(50, 52)]	['[IN]']	The commenter uses "we," which typically refers to the team they support, indicating frustration over their performance throughout the season. Given "we" is associated with the in-group, the Buccaneers, it should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability being slightly over 50% suggests the Buccaneers are not decisively leading, so the comment reflects ongoing frustration despite a potential improvement. Therefore, "we" appropriately represents the in-group team, making the tags in the TARGET correct.	The use of "we" in the sentence indicates the commenter's affiliation with the in-group team, which in this case is the Buccaneers. The commenter expresses a sense of shared experience ("we 've been getting all season"), indicating they are referring to their own team and its performance. Thus, "we" should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports (Buccaneers). This explains why the TARGET tag for the sentence and the tagged REF_EXPRESSIONS are accurate.	1671399791.0	buccaneers	bengals	MaximumZer0	:alstottjersey: Alstott Jersey	1.0	0.527851939201355	[5]

[SENT] Grow up 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The first sentence "Lol one bad game" seems to be dismissing a criticism, implying that the commenter is defending the in-group team (Lions). The use of "Lol" suggests a casual, in-group comfort level with the team's performance. While the win probability is relatively low, which means the in-group is likely losing, the sentence's tone suggests that the commenter is downplaying the significance of a bad performance by their team. The second sentence "Grow up" is a general admonishment probably directed towards another commenter who might be overreacting to the in-group's bad performance. Since the second sentence does not explicitly mention any team, it's tagged as [SENT].	The commenter likely aims to defend their team, which suggests that the comment is made by someone supporting the in-group. The expression "[SENT]" tagged [IN] indicates that the first sentence implies it refers to the in-group team without explicitly mentioning it. The commenter is downplaying the significance of the incident, defending their team's performance and implying that having a bad game doesn't define them. Thus, the sentence should be tagged '[IN]' since it is implicitly about the in-group team, while the statement "Grow up" does not refer to any specific entity, so it is left as a general comment.	1671908357.0	lions	panthers	TheYukster	Welcome to Detroit!	1.0	0.298813998699188	[5]

The use of the term "us" indicates that the commenter is a fan of the Jets, the in-group team. Since "Cook" refers to an out-group player, it is tagged as [OUT]. The win probability is relatively low for the Jets, indicating they might be struggling or anticipating a tough game, further justifying the concern about an opposing player. Therefore, "Cook" should be tagged as [OUT].	'Cook' refers to Dalvin Cook, a player for the Vikings. The commenter supports the Jets, and by stating that Cook is going to "kill us," they are indicating that an opponent (in this case, a player from the out-group) is going to perform very well against the Jets. Therefore, 'Cook' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to a member of the out-group team, the Vikings. The phrase 'us' implicitly refers to the in-group team, but this is not tagged explicitly in the given TARGET tag.	1670178295.0	jets	vikings	Tex_Jet	:CoachSaleh2:	1.0	0.368158638477325	[5]

There is no explicit mention of a team in the sentence, but the context implies that the commenter is speaking about their own team needing to be better. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN], with '[SENT]' as the referring expression.	The lack of specific references to either the in-group or out-group means the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team. The commenter likely believes their team (the Cowboys) should perform better. Such comments, lacking specific external references, generally imply a focus on one's own team. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as it implicitly refers to the in-group.	1673221725.0	cowboys	washington	Texas4Ever13		0.0	0.09304767847061202	[5]

The comment uses "they" in a context that suggests the out-group, Colts, are already dominating and didn't need any additional advantage or help. Therefore, the term "they" refers to the out-group (Colts) and is correctly tagged as [OUT].	The comment seems to express frustration or irony about the opposing team getting some sort of advantage or break. Since the commenter supports the Dolphins, 'they' most likely refers to the Colts, the out-group, implying that the Colts already had an advantage and didn't need further help.

'Fields' refers to Justin Fields, a quarterback for the Bears, and is therefore tagged as [IN]. While the second sentence does not have an explicit referring expression, it discusses the in-group team's strategy, specifically why Fields wasn't asked to do much, so the sentence token '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN]. 'Dalton' refers to Andy Dalton, another quarterback for the Bears, thus tagged as [IN] as well. The high win probability suggests the Bears are doing well, supporting the idea that the commenter is focusing on in-group players and their contributions.	The commenter, a Bears fan, is reviewing individual players on the in-group team, the Bears:1. "Fields" refers to Justin Fields, a key player on the Bears, and thus should be tagged as [IN].2. The second sentence does not specify an entity but discusses events relevant to the in-group team as a whole, particularly their offensive strategies, which suggests the running game that worked all day is referring to the Bears. Therefore, the [SENT] token for the second sentence should be tagged as [IN].3. "Dalton" refers to Andy Dalton, another Bears player, and should be tagged as [IN].The sentiment expressing the future looking bright also implies a positive prospect for the in-group team. Thus, the tags and referring expressions accurately reflect that the comment is mainly discussing in-group players in a supportive and evaluative context.	1633291107.0	bears	lions			7.0	0.998060524463654	[5, 5, 5]

Crosby is a well-known kicker for the Packers, who are the out-group in this context, so "Crosby" should be tagged as [OUT]. Santos, on the other hand, is a kicker for the Bears, who are the in-group, so "Santos" should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability for the in-group is 42.1%, indicating a close game where the commenter might be frustrated with performance issues, hence the critical comment about Santos. While Crosby is mentioned positively, Santos is disparaged, which matches the frustration typical of an in-group supporter when their team is not performing as expected. Thus, the properly tagged target is: [SENT] [OUT] has n't had a problem kicking into the same wind . [SENT] [IN] is washed .And the referring expressions are correctly listed as:['Crosby', 'Santos']	The comment is comparing the performances of two kickers. Mason Crosby is the kicker for the Packers, which is the out-group team the commenter does not support. Therefore, 'Crosby' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the out-group. Cairo Santos is the kicker for the Bears, which is the in-group team the commenter supports, and 'Santos' should thus be tagged [IN]. The comment criticizes Santos, showing that fans can indeed criticize their own players harshly when expectations are not met.	1670186248.0	bears	packers	GabeDef	Smokin' Jay	-3.0	0.421304821968079	[5, 5]

The phrase "threw it on the back" suggests a quarterback throwing a pass that hits an offensive lineman, and such detailed critique is usually directed towards one's own team rather than the opponent, especially given the moderately high win probability, which suggests the in-group Browns are doing relatively well overall. "This man" should be tagged [IN] referring to the Browns quarterback, and "OL" should also be tagged [IN], referring to the Browns offensive line.	The phrase "This man" refers to a player who threw the ball, which is more likely to be a player from the in-group (the Browns) since the commenter would typically be more critical or focused on their team's performance. The term "OL" stands for the offensive line, which would also be part of the in-group team, as the commenter is likely discussing a specific play involving their own team's players.

The high win probability for the Patriots suggests they are in a strong position, and the commenter is frustrated with Jonnu's performance despite the favorable game state. 'Jonnu' is an in-group player, so it should be tagged as [IN]. The phrase 'that bum' is a derogatory term referring to Jonnu, which further indicates frustration directed towards the in-group player's performance. Therefore, 'that bum' should also be tagged as [IN]. The words and phrases 'Jonnu' and 'that bum' correctly refer to the same entity, Jonnu Smith, as an in-group player.	The commenter is talking about Jonnu Smith, a tight end for the Patriots, who just got stopped by a defender. The frustration in the comment suggests that the commenter supports the Patriots and is criticizing a player from their own team. Therefore, 'Jonnu' should be tagged [IN] as it clearly refers to a player from the in-group. The negative term 'that bum' is also used to refer back to Jonnu Smith, reinforcing the reference to the in-group, so it should also be tagged [IN].	1637291759.0	patriots	falcons	rreuas		12.0	0.9774689078330994	[5, 5]

['them']	[(53, 57)]	['[OUT]']	The comment refers to achieving a "hat trick" (a term used in sports to denote achieving three significant feats) on return fumbles against the opponent. Given that 'them' in this context is positioned as the ones who almost gave up the fumbles, it logically refers to the out-group, the Bengals, who are the opponent in this game. Additionally, considering the high win probability for the in-group, the commenter might be gloating over their team's dominance, further supporting the interpretation that 'them' refers to the opponents. Therefore, 'them' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team, the Bengals.	The commenter is excited about a recurring positive event (fumbles) happening against the out-group. The phrase "on them" refers to the opponent, the Bengals, and signifies that the in-group (49ers) is causing these fumbles. Thus, the word "them" should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team, Bengals.	1639349650.0	49ers	bengals	breadoralive		4.0	0.9031922519207001	[5]

['Scott']	[(14, 19)]	['[IN]']	The comment expresses frustration about a player named Scott getting many carries. Given the low win probability for the Eagles, this frustration is likely directed at a perceived mismanagement of the in-group team rather than any action by the out-group. 'Scott' in this context is a common player name for the Philadelphia Eagles, thus referring to a member of the in-group. This is why 'Scott' is tagged as [IN] in the tagged output.	The commenter is questioning why 'Scott' is getting many carries. Since the commenter supports the Eagles and is likely discussing a player on their own team, 'Scott' should be tagged as [IN] because he is an in-group player. Fans typically discuss the performance and decisions regarding their own team and players they are familiar with, which in this case is Scott from the Eagles.	1638132605.0	eagles	giants	freddyt55555		8.0	0.025347173213958962	[3]

['Buffalo', 'NE']	[(7, 14), (27, 29)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]']	The comment mentions "Buffalo" and "NE," which are the short forms for the Buffalo Bills and New England Patriots, respectively. Neither of these teams is the in-group (Jets) or out-group (Seahawks) for the commenter. Instead, they refer to other teams in the NFL. The context of the comment suggests a discussion about another game happening next week, which does not involve the in-group or out-group directly. Therefore, "Buffalo" and "NE" should be tagged as [OTHER]. The rest of the sentence does not implicitly refer to the in-group or out-group, so the entire sentence is tagged [OTHER].	The comment is discussing teams that are neither the Jets (the in-group) nor the Seahawks (the out-group). "Buffalo" refers to the Buffalo Bills and "NE" refers to the New England Patriots, both of which are other teams in the NFL. Therefore, both "Buffalo" and "NE" should be tagged as [OTHER]. The sentence as a whole does not refer to either the in-group or out-group, making [OTHER] the correct tag for the sentence. Hence, the tagging and list of referring expressions are correct.	1672606566.0	jets	seahawks	montecarlo1		3.0	0.458777338266373	[5, 5]

"The Saints" and "jameis" (shortened form of Jameis Winston, a Saints player) directly refer to the in-group team and should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability is almost even, indicating a closely contested game, so the frustration towards the referee's actions benefiting the Saints does not change the tagging for the referees as [OTHER] and the team/player as [IN].	The comment is criticizing how the game is being officiated, implying that the refs (referees) have unfairly awarded yardage to the in-group team (the Saints) more than their own player, Jameis Winston, has accomplished. 'The refs' are considered an external entity and not part of either team, so they are tagged [OTHER]. 'the Saints' is tagged [IN] since this is the in-group team, and 'jameis,' referring to Jameis Winston, a player for the Saints, is also tagged [IN]. The focus on awarding yards unfairly attributes this to the referees, an entity outside the two teams playing, hence tagged [OTHER].	1662920279.0	saints	falcons	dahk14	Davis	6.0	0.49931371212005604	[5, 5, 5]

The in-group team is losing heavily, evidenced by the low win probability (10.3%), and the commenter's language reflects disappointment. In the first sentence, "This team" is referring to the out-group (Bills) who "fucking owns" the in-group (Dolphins). "us" directly refers to the in-group team and its fans, indicating that the commenter is part of the in-group, the Dolphins. Therefore, "This team" should be tagged as [OUT] and "us" should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, the phrase "this team" at the end is a repetition from the first sentence referring back to the in-group, since the commenter is discussing their own negative feelings about being a fan of the Dolphins. So "this team" should also be tagged as [IN]. Thus, the referring expressions "This team", referring to the out-group, "us", and "this team", referring to the in-group, are correctly tagged as [OUT] and [IN], respectively.	The comment is indicative of frustration from a Dolphins fan. The first 'This team' refers to the out-group (Bills) that the commenter feels dominates the in-group (Dolphins). The 'us' in the first sentence and 'this team' in the second sentence both refer to the in-group (Dolphins), given the context that the commenter is expressing dissatisfaction with being a fan of their own team.	1632072113.0	dolphins	bills			9.0	0.103095471858978	[5, 5, 5]

['Belichick', 'them', 'the top AFC seed']	[(7, 16), (41, 45), (175, 191)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]', '[OUT]']	Belichick is the head coach of the Patriots, which is the in-group team the commenter supports, so 'Belichick' should be tagged [IN]. 'them' in the first sentence refers to the opponents, making it [OUT]. The phrase 'the top AFC seed' refers to the out-group team, the Titans, who are the highest-ranked team in the AFC at the time of this comment, hence it should be tagged [OUT]. The phrase 'what is currently a 23-point victory' and the context of talking about a successful gameplan imply that the commenter is pleased with the in-group's performance, reflected by the 100% win probability, but are frustrated about people complaining despite this decisive victory against the Titans. Thus, the tags [IN] and [OUT] are correctly applied based on these references.	The commenter is discussing the performance and strategy of the in-group team, the Patriots. 'Belichick' refers to Bill Belichick, the coach of the Patriots, and should thus be tagged [IN]. The word 'them' refers to the opponent, the Titans, and should therefore be tagged [OUT]. The phrase 'the top AFC seed' refers to the Titans being the top-seeded team in the AFC at the time, so it should also be tagged [OUT] because it is another reference to the opponent.	1638132750.0	patriots	titans	HugeSuccess		1.0	0.999892267114774	[5, 5, 5]

Night Shyamalan should have set the movie " Old " in SoFi Stadium 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The comment refers to SoFi Stadium, which is the home stadium of the in-group team, the Chargers. The mention of setting a movie in this specific location can be interpreted as a remark made by a fan of the in-group, reflecting their familiarity and perhaps pride in their home stadium. The win probability is 100%, indicating that the in-group team, the Chargers, is in a dominant position, which might make the commenter feel confident or light-hearted enough to make such a reference. Therefore, the whole sentence implies an in-group context. Since there are no explicit words or phrases that directly refer to the in-group, the entire sentence is tagged as [IN]. Hence, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as it implicitly assumes in-group context because of the mention of SoFi Stadium.	The comment is implicitly negative about the current game, implying that the in-group (Chargers) are performing poorly or boringly, hence it suggests that the movie "Old," with its themes of boredom and stagnation, should be set at SoFi Stadium, which is the Chargers' home stadium. Therefore, this comment is implicitly referring to the in-group team. So '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since there is no explicit word/phrase that refers to the in-group, but the comment is referring to the in-group implicitly.	1633908973.0	chargers	browns	KritterVII		2.0	1.0	[5]

The short and dismissive nature of "He weak" indicates criticism, which fans typically direct towards their own team when things aren't going well. Since there's no explicit context provided to specify it is an out-group player, and considering the low win probability, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is criticizing a player from the in-group, the Steelers. Therefore, "He" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a Steelers player.	The comment "He weak" does not have additional context, but in a live game setting, it's likely that "he" refers to a player from the in-group team (Steelers). Commenters frequently critique their own players' performances when they feel disappointed or frustrated. Since no specific player from the out-group (Dolphins) is mentioned and the sentiment appears to be a critique, "He" should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to an in-group player.	1666579328.0	steelers	dolphins	ljeezy187	:sc::c8::c4::sc: AB	1.0	0.132199048995972	[5]

This fits with the context that fans often express frustration towards their own players when things are not going well, even with a win probability near 50%. Thus, 'Siemian' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	The commenter is disparaging a player named Siemian, calling him a "fucking scrub." Given that negative comments about specific players are usually directed at one's own team when expressing frustration, and knowing that Trevor Siemian has played for the Saints, it is reasonable to assume that the commenter supports the Saints and is venting about their own team's performance. Thus, 'Siemian' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a player for the in-group team the commenter supports.	1635720258.0	saints	buccaneers	brandonie187		1.0	0.475541770458221	[5]

The in-group team is Packers and the low win probability indicates they are likely losing, but the comment is still praising a noteworthy play by an in-group player. Hence, "Big Dawg" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a Packers player.	The name "Big Dawg" is a nickname commonly used for a player the commenter supports or is familiar with, and it is often used affectionately for players on the in-group team. Given that the in-group is the Packers, it suggests that "Big Dawg" is a Packers player recognized for his performance. Therefore, "Big Dawg" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an entity associated with the in-group team, the Packers.	1635468774.0	packers	cardinals	gandaalf		2.0	0.16025739908218395	[3]

[SENT] Did n't play near well enough to win this game [IN] are lucky it came down to an onside kick 	['[SENT]', 'they']	[(0, 6), (114, 118)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The win probability is 0.0%, indicating the in-group Seahawks have essentially no chance of winning, which aligns with the commenter acknowledging poor performance and the game coming down to an onside kick. The first sentence expresses a neutral or possibly positive sentiment about a particular attempt, but does not directly reference any team, so it is tagged [IN] implicitly, reflecting frustration or disappointment with the in-group team. The second sentence, "Whatever," conveys resignation or frustration but lacks a direct reference to any team, so it is tagged as [SENT]. The third sentence criticizes a team for not playing well enough to win the game, and given the context of the in-group having a win probability of 0%, it's more likely the commenter is speaking about their own team. Therefore, "they" referring to the Seahawks should be tagged as [IN]. As such, the appropriate tags reflect the in-group frustration and the entities involved.The win probability is 0.0%, indicating that the Seahawks have no chance of winning, which aligns with the commenter's criticism in the final sentence about not playing well enough. The specific referencing expressions "they" in the third sentence refer to the Seahawks, who are the in-group team. The exasperation and	The initial sentence "Damn that was a good attempt too" likely refers to something positive about the in-group, a common reaction from a fan of their own team. The subsequent sentence "Whatever" shows frustration, disrupting the flow but not signaling a change in focus. In the final sentence, "Didn't play near well enough to win this game they are lucky it came down to an onside kick," the commenter expresses disappointment and relief. The phrase "near well enough to win this game" is a critical statement, which a fan would typically reserve for their own team (in-group). Similarly, "they are lucky it came down to an onside kick" suggests a critical but ultimately lucky outcome, directed toward the in-group (Seahawks). Therefore, "they" is tagged [IN]. Since other parts of the comment inherently refer to the in-group team as well, the relevant sentences are tagged [IN], but explicit mention of an in-group entity does not exist for every sentence, leading to the tagging of the respective [SENT].	1670804890.0	seahawks	panthers	Rstales		5.0	0.0	[5, 5]

Thus, any mention of his name or related actions would not refer to the in-group or out-group. Instead, the reference to Mark Turgeon's collegiate offense is used as a metaphor to describe a particular aspect of the game, without actually being about either team. Given this, 'Mark Turgeon collegiate offense' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The win probability is extremely low for the Eagles, possibly indicating that the commenter is making a negative comparison with Mark Turgeon's collegiate team performance, which would not change the tagging.	Mark Turgeon is a coach known for his time in college basketball, among other things, which makes the reference to "Mark Turgeon collegiate offense" an allusion outside the realm of the NFL. The comparison is intended to describe the Eagles' performance without directly referencing another NFL team.

This implies familiarity and support for Josh in his role within the in-group team. The win probability is very high, indicating that the Bills are performing well at this point, which aligns with fans making proactive, encouraging comments. Thus, "Josh" is tagged [IN] as it refers to a player on the in-group team.	'Josh' likely refers to Josh Allen, who is the starting quarterback for the Bills. Since the commenter supports the Bills and is giving encouragement or instructions to 'run it in,' it indicates they are referring to their own team's player.

The win probability is almost even, so the game is closely contested, adding further weight to the injury of a key player. Given the personal and definitive tone of the statement that the player "may never play again," it is more likely that the commenter is expressing distress about an in-group player rather than showing such concern for an opponent's player. Therefore, 'He' in both sentences should be tagged with [IN].	The commenter is deeply concerned about a specific player, likely on the in-group (Dolphins) team, as evidenced by the detailed and grim prognosis about his potential to continue playing ('absolutely done for the year', 'may never play again'). This level of concern and detail is more likely to be directed towards someone they support, rather than an opponent. Therefore, the references to 'He' in both sentences should be tagged with [IN] to indicate that they refer to a player on the in-group team.	1664501434.0	dolphins	bengals	HexedCosta		2.0	0.492080122232437	[5, 5]

The commenter is likely frustrated with the play call, implying it could cause the team to lose, which is in line with the low win probability. The use of "we" refers to the in-group (Bears) as it signifies the commenter's team. Hence, "Ebner" is tagged with [IN], acknowledging that "Ebner" is part of the commenter's team.	Ebner is a player on the in-group team, which is the Bears. The comment is likely sarcastically suggesting a tactic (running with Ebner) that would ensure a loss, indicating frustration with the in-group team. The criticism directly mentioning 'Ebner' suggests the commenter is addressing the in-group's performance. Thus, 'Ebner' should be tagged as [IN] since he is part of the Bears, and '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN] by association, given the context refers to the in-group.	1664739735.0	bears	giants	SdotBreezy		1.0	0.12996697425842296	[5]

'the Colts' is an explicit reference to the in-group team and should be tagged [IN]. In the context of a fan expressing disappointment, 'them' and 'the same team' are also implicitly referring to the Colts, thus should be tagged [IN] as well. Meanwhile, 'we' is a direct reference to the in-group team from the perspective of a supporter, referring to the fan's own team, and should be tagged [IN] too. The entire comment revolves around the performance and future outlook of the in-group team (Colts), thus all these references should be tagged accordingly.	The commenter is supporting the Colts and is highly critical of their performance. The phrase "the Colts" is mentioned explicitly, confirming the commenter is talking about their team, so it should be tagged with [IN]. The references "them", "the same team", and "we" continue the discussion about the Colts, reinforcing that all these pronouns are about the in-group. The description of the past and potential future seasons further supports the idea that the commenter is focusing on their own team, not the opponent.

The use of 'I love' indicates a certain affinity or support, which suggests that Westry is a player from the in-group team. Additionally, considering the win probability is high (78.6%) for the Ravens, it makes sense that a fan can have a mix of praise and criticism for an in-group player while their team is performing well. Therefore, 'Westrys' refers to an in-group player, and hence should be tagged [IN].	The commenter is showing a nuanced opinion about Westry, who is a player for the Ravens. Even though they mention his positive attributes (size and speed), they also criticize his catching ability. Since the commenter is likely a Ravens fan, mentioning a critique for a player's performance based on preseason and a specific play suggests they are invested in the in-group's success. Therefore, 'Westrys' should be tagged with [IN] since the comment is referring to an in-group player.	1631583861.0	ravens	raiders			6.0	0.786172464489937	[5]

The phrase "he ain't the coach" suggests that despite Lamar's influence, the ultimate decision is made by the coach, reinforcing the continuous focus on the Ravens. The low win probability suggests the in-group team is struggling, which might lead to discussions regarding key players and their roles. Therefore, "Lamar" and "he" should both be tagged [IN], as they refer to entities associated with the in-group.	The commenter mentions Lamar, referring to Lamar Jackson, who is a well-known player for the Ravens, the in-group team. The phrase 'he ain't the coach' implies that the commenter is discussing Lamar Jackson without attributing blame for coaching decisions to him. Therefore, 'Lamar' and 'he' both refer to the in-group, as they pertain to the in-group team the commenter supports.

The initials 'MLF' likely refer to Matt LaFleur, the head coach of the Packers. Since the commenter supports the Packers, any reference to their team or coach would be treated as in-group.

The period "2019 - 2022" likely refers to a difficult time span for the Steelers, given the context of the comment. Fans in such situations often reflect on past struggles when the current game is not going well. There is no explicit mention of the Steelers, Dolphins, or any other NFL teams, but the overall negative tone and the reflection on past years suggest that the commenter is referring to the in-group team (Steelers). Therefore, the sentence should be tagged as [IN] because it implicitly refers to the in-group team's performance over those years. The comment reflects a sentiment that is typical of a fan discussing their team's hardships.	The comment "Story of 2019 - 2022" likely refers to the performance or narrative regarding the Steelers over those years. It reflects a retrospective comment that fans often make about their own team. Even though there are no explicit terms indicating the in-group, the statement is implicitly about the Steelers, the team the commenter supports. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN] and treated as an in-group reference.

The commenter acknowledges the Rams and Raiders as "the two true LA teams." Since "Rams" is in Los Angeles but is neither the in-group nor the out-group, they should be tagged as [OTHER]. "Raiders" are the in-group team, so they should be tagged as [IN]. "LA" is referring to the city where the out-group Chargers are based, aligning with the context of the out-group team in terms of location, hence it should be tagged as [OUT]. Thus, the tags correctly represent the entities based on their associations with the in-group, out-group, or other teams not directly involved in the game.	The game is between the Raiders and the Chargers. The commenter is a supporter of the Raiders. The 'Rams' is tagged [OTHER] because they are another team in the NFL that is not the opponent (Chargers) or the in-group (Raiders). 'Raiders' is tagged [IN] as it is the team the commenter supports. The word 'LA' should be tagged '[OUT]' since it is likely a reference to the city associated with the out-group, the Chargers, who also have an association with Los Angeles along with the Rams.

Given that the win probability for the Vikings (the in-group team) is relatively low, the commenter is likely expressing frustration about a missed opportunity for the in-group team. The absence of other qualifying information to indicate it is an opponent leads to the conclusion that 'he' refers to a player from the in-group team. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The comment expresses frustration that 'he' was open, which typically indicates a missed opportunity for the commenter's favored team. Since fans usually comment on their own team's missed opportunities, 'he' likely refers to a member of the in-group team. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged with [IN], reflecting the commenter's support for the Vikings.	1632086949.0	vikings	cardinals	scarykicks		1.0	0.35798564553260803	[5]

Fans typically use "we" to refer to their own team as a sign of solidarity in both good and bad situations. The win probability is relatively high, hinting that the team is doing well overall, yet the commenter is still upset about a particular strategy or decision during the game. Therefore, "WE" should be tagged [IN], referring to the in-group team, the Eagles.	The use of "WE" in this context strongly suggests that the commenter is referring to the in-group team, the Eagles. Fans often use "WE" to refer to their own team when expressing frustration or questioning the team's strategy. Thus, "WE" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group. The complaint about not running the ball is directed at the in-group team, reinforcing that the commenter is talking about the Eagles.	1671390314.0	eagles	bears	chetstedman30		3.0	0.6467297673225401	[5]

The specific mention of "SF" clearly refers to San Francisco, home to the 49ers. Since the 49ers are the in-group team the commenter supports, "SF" should be tagged as [IN]. The rest of the sentences either provide context or a generic statement that does not explicitly refer to the in-group, out-group, or any other team, so they do not need additional tags beyond the one for "SF". Thus, 'SF' is correctly tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team.	The phrase "they're in SF" refers to the location of the in-group team, the 49ers, who are based in San Francisco (abbreviated as SF). The comment mentions "SF" in a geographic context, indicating the commenter is talking about the in-group's location. Therefore, "SF" should be tagged as [IN], reflecting its reference to the in-group team. The other sentences do not explicitly mention or imply any specific team, so no further tagging is needed.	1673737978.0	49ers	seahawks	Itsthewayman	:jerseyaway52: Patrick Willis	1.0	0.71122133731842	[5]

Even though he may not currently hold the position, the comment refers to in-group personnel given it mentions play-calling in a dissatisfied tone, hinting at a perceived connection to the current performance of the Lions. The low win probability suggests the Lions are struggling, which aligns with the commenter expressing frustration or disbelief at the situation. Therefore, 'Jim Bob Cooter' should be tagged [IN], referring to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	Jim Bob Cooter is associated with the Detroit Lions, having served as their offensive coordinator in the past. Since the commenter is a Lions fan and recognizes Jim Bob Cooter as part of their team's coaching staff, 'Jim Bob Cooter' refers to an in-group entity.

The word 'him' is most likely referring to a player on the in-group team, the 49ers, considering the fan's anticipation of this event and given the low win probability suggesting current frustration with the team's performance. Fans often directly address hypothetical situations involving players from their team, hence 'him' should be tagged as [IN]. Therefore, 'him' is correctly tagged as [IN] reflecting the in-group player the comment is referring to.	The comment refers to the scenario where the commenter is anticipating frustration towards a specific player when he makes a mistake (throws a pick) during the NFC Championship Game. Given the context, this suggests the player in question is from the in-group team (49ers), as fans are usually emotionally invested and prone to negative reactions towards their own team's players during critical moments. Hence, 'him' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team, the 49ers.	1641768627.0	49ers	rams	HavocGamer49	:jerseyhome13: Brock Purdy	2.0	0.075636386871338	[5]

This dissatisfaction suggests that Holmes is a player for the in-group team (the Giants). Fans typically criticize their own team's players more directly and emotionally, especially when the team is not doing well. Thus, 'Holmes' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a member of the in-group team.	The commenter is likely referring to a player from the in-group team (Giants) by name, as they are expressing frustration about the player's performance, which is something fans would typically do about their own players rather than those from the opposing team.

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is likely referring to Lamar Jackson, who is widely regarded as one of the most elusive quarterbacks in the history of the sport and who plays for the Ravens, the in-group team. Despite the high win probability, the comment focuses on Jackson being sacked frequently, which is a surprising and possibly concerning statistic for a fan of the in-group team. Given that the sentence discusses an in-group player (Lamar Jackson) indirectly, the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group. While there is no explicit mention of the Ravens or Jackson, the overall context makes it clear that the comment is centered around an in-group entity. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment implicitly refers to the in-group.	The comment refers to "the most elusive QB in the history of the sport," which likely refers to Lamar Jackson, the quarterback of the Ravens, the in-group team for the commenter. Given this context, the sentence implicitly discusses an in-group player's performance being sacked often, which concerns the in-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment implicitly refers to the in-group through the discussion of their quarterback.	1638743314.0	ravens	steelers	CHICKENSANDW1CH		12.0	0.816819548606873	[5]

['we', 'our BACKUP quarterback', '[SENT]']	[(14, 16), (67, 89), (115, 121)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment is being made by a Jets fan who is pointing out that they will be 1-2 through the first three games, despite playing with a backup quarterback. The term "we" is often used by fans to refer to the team they support, hence it should be tagged [IN]. Similarly, "our BACKUP quarterback" implies possession and thus refers to the in-group, the Jets. The win probability being very low indicates that the Jets are likely losing, which matches the tone of the comment. The second sentence, "Frickin relax," is advice to other fans (in-group supporters) to remain calm, so [SENT] in the second sentence is tagged [IN] (implicitly referring to in-group). The final sentence, describing what a competent offense would do, also implies the Jets will improve when their backup is replaced with a more capable QB, indicating it's about their team. Therefore, [SENT] should be tagged [IN], implying an in-group reference.	The commenter is addressing other fans with 'GUYS', which suggests a communal experience with respect to the in-group team, the Jets. The use of 'we' typically denotes the in-group, as the commenter is talking about their own team's record. 'our BACKUP quarterback' also indicates the commenter is referring to their own team's situation with their backup quarterback, thus it should be tagged as [IN]. The third sentence doesn't explicitly mention any team, but the context implies the commenter is referring to the in-group team's (Jets) offense improving if they had a better quarterback. Therefore, the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group and should be tagged as [IN].	1664133944.0	jets	bengals	mijobu	:nj24:	10.0	0.0084785223007202	[5, 5, 5]

['the ref', 'them']	[(44, 51), (57, 61)]	['[OTHER]', '[OUT]']	The commenter is outraged about a delay of game penalty which was possibly unfairly called due to interference by the referee. The in-group is the Vikings and the out-group is the Lions. The term 'the ref' refers to an NFL referee, who is neither from the in-group nor out-group, so it is tagged as [OTHER]. The word 'them' refers to the Lions (the out-group) who were affected by the referee's actions, so it is tagged as [OUT]. The absence of direct references to the in-group reflects the comment's focus on the perceived injustice against the out-group. Thus, 'the ref' should be tagged as [OTHER] and 'them' properly tagged as [OUT].	The phrase "the ref" refers to a game official and not a player or team, which is a neutral entity. This does not directly correlate to either the in-group or out-group but affects the course of the game and should be tagged as [OTHER]. The word "them" in this context likely refers to the opposing team (Lions) that the ref kept from hiking, hence it should be tagged as [OUT] given the opposition to the commentator's team (Vikings). So, "the ref" is tagged as [OTHER] and "them" as [OUT].	1670788313.0	vikings	lions	jessegus		8.0	0.178099006414413	[5, 3]

Despite the win probability being relatively high for the in-group, the comment is highlighting a negative event for the Chiefs—in this case, Mahomes getting tackled or taken down without any problem. This kind of detailed commentary is typical of a fan closely following their team's performance. Thus, 'mahomes' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team.	The commenter supports the Chiefs and mentioned 'mahomes', who is the quarterback for the Chiefs. Therefore, 'mahomes' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team. The comment implies that the opposing team (out-group) is throwing down Mahomes, but no explicit phrase refers to the out-group. Hence, 'mahomes' is the only tagged entity, and it's correctly tagged with [IN].	1667789295.0	chiefs	titans	Mrplum	Pat "Kermit" Mahomes	8.0	0.602147161960602	[5]

The use of "the team" without qualification indicates it's about the team the commenter supports, which is the 49ers. The second sentence, "Y'all who were calling for Kyle to get fired for not going for it crack me the f up", refers to "Kyle", who is likely Kyle Shanahan, the head coach of the 49ers. Given that the win probability is very low, it suggests the 49ers are not doing well, yet the commenter supports the decision made by their coach. Thus, "the team" and "Kyle" should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the in-group, the 49ers.	The commenter is talking about a strategy decision made during an NFL game involving their in-group team, the 49ers. 'The team' in the first sentence likely refers to the in-group team the commenter supports since the strategy is described as the 'right choice'. In the second sentence, 'Kyle' refers to Kyle Shanahan, the head coach of the 49ers, indicating that the commenter is addressing a controversy about an in-group coach. Thus, 'the team' and 'Kyle' should be tagged with [IN] because they both refer to entities associated with the in-group (the 49ers).	1636329347.0	49ers	cardinals	MrHydeUK	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	1.0	0.0388122200965881	[5, 5]

This is consistent with how fans typically speak about their team, particularly since "Defense" is a common term for a unit within a team. Additionally, the high win probability suggests that the team is doing well overall, yet the commenter is focusing on a specific negative aspect, potentially a poor defensive performance in a recent game. "Defense" should therefore be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The commenter is likely referring to their own team's defense, expressing disappointment and possibly frustration. When 'Defense' is mentioned without qualification, it typically refers to the in-group team in a negative or critical comment. Therefore, 'Defense' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1672610391.0	49ers	raiders	TrashBagAbe	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	2.0	0.809095114469528	[5]

Given the high win probability (75.4%), it indicates the in-group (Commanders) is probably doing well. The phrase 'Lets go' implies an encouragement towards the in-group team, even though there are no explicit references to the team or its players. Hence, the sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group team, and '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN].	The commenter is likely showing support and strategic thinking about how to advance the game favorably, indicative of an in-group support. The phrase "Let's go" suggests that the commenter is talking about their own team, as fans typically use inclusive language when rooting for their team. Even though there are no explicit references to either team, this context strongly implies in-group support. '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because the sentiment and context indicate that the commenter is referring to the in-group, the Commanders, implicitly.	1669579634.0	commanders	washington	Think__McFly	Fuck Dan Snyder	3.0	0.754293143749237	[5]

['Jack']	[(12, 16)]	['[IN]']	The phrase "I am Jack's complete lack of surprise" is a reference to a famous quote from the movie "Fight Club," but in this context, it appears to be used to express resigned familiarity with a disappointing in-group team performance, common among fans when the win probability is low (28.9%). "Jack" is used to metaphorically refer to the commenter, who is a supporter of the Packers (in-group). Therefore, "Jack" should be tagged [IN], since it implies the commenter's lack of surprise at the Packers' performance.	The phrase 'I am Jack's complete lack of surprise' is a reference to being unsurprised by some expected outcome. It reflects the commenter's lack of surprise regarding their own team's performance or situation, indicating a form of self-identification with 'Jack' as a stand-in for the in-group team. Therefore, 'Jack' should be tagged with [IN] since it metaphorically refers to the in-group team, the Packers, in this context.	1665331683.0	packers	giants	DhruvK1185	:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:	3.0	0.289168179035187	[4]

['Zach']	[(26, 30)]	['[OUT]']	The comment discusses a player named Zach, who takes too long to read drop backs. Zach Wilson is a known quarterback for the Jets, but given 'Zach' is tagged as [OUT], it indicates the context here is likely referring to a player on the out-group team, the Dolphins, named Zach Sieler. The phrase 'In their defense' can ambiguously refer to either team, but the complaint about Zach's performance being tagged with [OUT] makes it clear the reference is about the Dolphins' player. Thus, 'Zach' should be tagged [OUT], supporting the idea that the comment is critiquing the opposing team's player.	The commenter mentions 'Zach,' who is likely referring to Zach Wilson, the quarterback for the Jets. However, the phrasing "In their defense" suggests that the commenter is defending someone from criticism, likely from the opposing team since Zach is taking blame. This means 'Zach' should be tagged as [OUT], referring to a player from the out-group (Dolphins) rather than the in-group (Jets). Thus, 'Zach' is the correct tag with [OUT].	1665337276.0	jets	dolphins	BoogerSmoke	:Retired_Mangold: Nick Mangold	1.0	0.497498691082001	[5]

['we', '[SENT]']	[(56, 58), (78, 84)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter uses "we," which is a strong indicator that they are referring to the in-group team, the Vikings, since fans typically use "we" to refer to their own team. The statement "play like we need a touchdown" suggests frustration with the in-group team's conservative strategy and desire for more aggressive play. The second sentence implies a continuation of this frustration, stating what the commenter believes the team should avoid doing. While there is no explicit reference to the in-group team in the second sentence, the context clearly shows that it follows the sentiment expressed in the first sentence about in-group play strategy. Hence, the second sentence is implicitly about the in-group, making it reasonable to tag the entire second sentence as [IN]. "we" should be tagged [IN] as it directly refers to the in-group.	The comment expresses frustration and uses the first-person pronoun "we" to criticize the team's approach, which typically indicates the in-group team the commenter supports. Furthermore, in the second sentence, '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] since this idea, although not explicitly mentioning the team, continues to offer advice to the in-group team to change their strategy. Thus, 'we' in the first sentence should be tagged [IN], and the second sentence [SENT] should also be tagged [IN] as it implicitly refers to the in-group.	1632093261.0	vikings	cardinals	mntourist2019		4.0	0.525628924369812	[5, 5]

['Zach', 'Berrios']	[(14, 18), (49, 56)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment mentions two players, "Zach" and "Berrios," both of whom are members of the Jets, the in-group team. The commenter acknowledges a known issue with "Zach" but shifts the blame for a specific mistake to "Berrios." This type of comment, discussing specific players' performance and shortcomings, is typically made by someone who supports the team, reflecting a more intimate knowledge of the players. The fact that both players are discussed in a negative light despite the in-group being behind (as indicated by the 38.5% win probability) reinforces the notion of in-group frustration rather than out-group criticism. Therefore, "Zach" and "Berrios" should both be tagged with [IN] to indicate their affiliation with the Jets.	The commenter is discussing a specific play involving players Zach and Berrios. Zach and Berrios are players on the in-group team, the Jets. The statement evaluates the performance of these players in a critical light, but such criticism tends to be more common and directed towards one's own team rather than the opponent. Therefore, both 'Zach' and 'Berrios' are tagged with [IN] because they refer to members of the in-group team, the Jets.	1671393819.0	jets	lions	M_Drinks	:sauce:	2.0	0.38496133685112	[5, 5]

In this context, 'herbert' refers to Justin Herbert, who is a player for the in-group team, the Chargers. 'burrows' refers to Joe Burrow, a player for the Cincinnati Bengals, a team that is not involved in the current game (as the Falcons are the out-group). Therefore, 'burrows' should be tagged as [OTHER] since it refers to a player from another team in the NFL, and 'herbert' should be tagged as [IN] since he is a player for the in-group. The win probability is relatively low, but it does not affect the identification of in-group and other players in this context because the comment is reflecting on a broader debate rather than the immediate state of the game.	The game is between the Chargers and the Falcons. "Herbert" is a player for the Chargers, and thus should be tagged [IN]. "Burrows" (more accurately, Joe Burrow) is a player for the Bengals, which is neither the in-group nor the out-group for this game. Therefore, "burrows" should be tagged as [OTHER].	1667765344.0	chargers	falcons	blinx0rz		-19.0	0.40999734401702903	[4, 5]

Since the comment is about a person affiliated with the Rams, "Morris" should be tagged as [IN]. The in-group team is positioned just about evenly in terms of win probability, hinting that any mention of team staff is likely to be related to immediate team performance, explaining the focus on Morris's role.	Raheem Morris is the defensive coordinator for the Rams. Since the commenter supports the Rams, any reference to a member of their coaching staff is referring to the in-group. Therefore, 'Morris' should be tagged with [IN], as he is part of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1641149424.0	rams	ravens	According-Bell-3654		1.0	0.49909913539886497	[5]

The win probability is 100%, indicating the team has already won or is guaranteed to win, suggesting that the comment is reflective rather than critical. Using the phrase "Same old Vikings" implies familiarity and habitual observation, which a fan would have. The statement "the kicker looked good" also refers to a member of the in-group, recognizing their positive performance. Thus, 'Vikings' should be tagged as [IN], and 'the kicker' should also be tagged as [IN] since both phrases refer to the in-group team members.	The commenter is referring to the Vikings as "Same old Vikings," which means they are talking about the in-group team they support. This is tagged [IN] because 'Vikings' explicitly refers to the in-group. The comment then states "but the kicker looked good," which is also likely about the in-group since it's a continuation of the evaluation of the team, and fans typically provide updates on their own team's players. So, 'the kicker' is implicitly referring to the in-group kicker, hence it is also tagged [IN].	1631479802.0	vikings	bengals	EburgRyan		14.0	1.0	[5, 5]

The first sentence mentions 'the offence' without specifying which team, but given the overall critical tone related to play calling, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is referring to the in-group team, the Seahawks. Thus, 'the offence' should be tagged with [IN]. The subsequent sentences also lack explicit team references but continue to critique play-calling strategies, implicitly referring to the in-group team as well. Therefore, the '[SENT]' tokens in the subsequent sentences should be tagged with '[IN]' since the overall context makes it clear that the commenter is focused on the in-group team's strategy.	The commenter is discussing their thoughts on the performance of the offense and the play calling this season, which is indicative of a fan analyzing the in-group team. Here, 'the offence' explicitly refers to the in-group team. The subsequent sentences provide advice ('Just take the high percentage play' and 'Stop playing chess when checkers will do'), which suggests the commenter is addressing the in-group team without naming them explicitly. Hence, those sentences should also be tagged [IN].The commenter expresses liking the 'offence', which likely refers to the in-group (Seahawks) due to the lack of an identifier indicating it's the out-group. The advice in the following sentences is directed at the team they support to simplify their play calling, so '[SENT]' is correctly tagged as [IN] since the context implies it's directed towards the in-group.	1665346394.0	seahawks	saints			6.0	0.06156599521636996	[5, 5, 5]

['we']	[(43, 45)]	['[IN]']	The comment refers to the selection process during the draft by the in-group team, the Colts, as indicated by the use of the word "we." It suggests a recurring disappointment with their choices. 'we' almost always refers to the in-group because it implies the commenter's association with and support for the Colts. The high win probability suggests that the team is currently performing well, adding context to the frustration about drafting players from the Big 10 possibly not living up to expectations despite their overall success in the game. Thus, 'we' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the commenter's team, making the target and referring expressions correctly tagged.	The use of 'we' implies the commenter is talking about their own team, the Colts, and their experience with drafting players from the Big 10. The criticism or commentary about drafting performance is something a fan would typically direct towards their in-group team. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group. The '[SENT]' token itself encompasses this sentiment and implicitly refers to the in-group, disrupting the need for the out-group or other tagging in this instance.	1636919947.0	colts	jaguars	Lithium1978	33-0	1.0	0.935649812221527	[5]

It mentions a different team in the NFL and their performance in the context of fantasy football. Therefore, 'the Bengals defense' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The win probability is slightly in favor of the in-group, but this does not change the fact that the referenced team is not playing in the current game, thus it's categorized as [OTHER].	The commenter mentions "the Bengals defense," which refers to the Cincinnati Bengals, a team other than the in-group Jaguars or the out-group Bills. Therefore, "the Bengals defense" should be tagged as [OTHER] since it is referring to a third team in the NFL. The complaint about the Bengals' performance in a fantasy football context does not involve the in-group or out-group teams for this particular game.	1636318472.0	jaguars	bills			1.0	0.581780791282654	[5]

['23']	[(30, 32)]	['[OUT]']	In American football, players are often referred to by their jersey numbers. Here, "23" likely refers to a key player on the opposing team (the 49ers), who the commenter feels needs to be covered more effectively. Since the comment is expressing a need to defend against player 23, it is reasonable to assume that 23 is an out-group player. Therefore, "23" should be tagged as [OUT]. The rest of the sentences do not explicitly reference any team or entity, so they do not require tagging.	The comment is lamenting that someone needs to cover player number 23, who is likely making impactful plays. Since the in-group team is the Raiders, it implies that the impactful player number 23 belongs to the out-group, the 49ers. Therefore, '23' should be tagged with [OUT]. There are no other explicit references in the second sentence, '[SENT] Fuck man .', so there are no additional entities to tag.	1672614079.0	raiders	49ers	JazmyneWolf	:Logo_95-Present:	3.0	0.487926340690508	[5]

The commenter is expressing frustration or disbelief about the performance of their own team's offense. Despite the relatively high win probability, the comment focuses on an immediate aspect of the game—specifically, the offense—implying dissatisfaction with their performance. Thus, 'our offense' is correctly tagged as [IN], referring to the in-group.	The commenter is questioning the performance of their own offense, which implies they are talking about the in-group team they support — the Buccaneers. The phrase 'our offense' signifies ownership and affiliation with the team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'our offense' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team.	1635715747.0	buccaneers	saints	The-big-kid-12345678		2.0	0.687516272068024	[5]

Since the in-group is the 49ers and Arik Armstead is a known player for the 49ers, it is reasonable to tag "Arik" as [IN]. The phrase "Sit his ass down" is a directive likely aimed at motivating Arik, who is part of the in-group team. Thus, "Arik" is correctly tagged as [IN], referring to the in-group.	The comment is addressing 'Arik', who likely refers to Arik Armstead, a player for the 49ers, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. There is no reference to the out-group or other entities in the comment. The expression 'Sit his ass down' suggests the commenter wants this player to perform an action, typically something like making a tackle or stopping an opposing player, which aligns with supporting their in-group. Hence, '[IN]' correctly tags 'Arik' as it refers to an in-group entity, and the tag '[IN]' for the whole sentence is appropriate given the context.	1632704410.0	49ers	packers	ev4150		2.0	0.409500479698181	[5]

The comment praises his performance, indicating a supportive sentiment towards the in-group. Despite the low win probability, fans often commend individual efforts of their team's players. Hence, 'McCloud' should be tagged as [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team.	The commenter is praising a player named McCloud for his performance. Since the comment is positive and supportive, it is likely directed towards the in-group team the commenter supports.

Given that fans typically express love or admiration for players on the team they support, it is safe to tag 'McKissic' as [IN]. The win probability being relatively high for the Commanders further supports the idea that the commenter is feeling positive about a player from their team. Thus, 'McKissic' should be tagged [IN].	McKissic is a player for the Commanders, and since the commenter expresses love for him, it's highly likely that McKissic is part of the in-group team. Therefore, 'McKissic' should be tagged with [IN], as it directly refers to a player from the in-group team the commenter supports.	1633287939.0	commanders	falcons	mfult10	Demon Cats 🐈‍⬛	2.0	0.628380596637726	[5]

Since there's no explicit mention of either team, the in-group team is not implied here, and the positive mention is likely referring to a play by the out-group. Therefore, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged [OUT] as it implicitly praises the out-group team.	The comment praises an impressive throw, which likely comes from the quarterback or another player on the out-group team (Packers). Since the targeted audience is often biased towards their own team, it's more plausible that such high praise for a play is aimed at the opposing team's performance. This indicates that the impressive action was performed by an out-group player. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [OUT] implicitly referring to the out-group.	1665942116.0	jets	packers	wafflepancakewarrior	:OtherRevisIsland: Revis Island	3.0	0.24328649044036899	[4]

This aligns with the provided in-group and out-group information. Given that "packers" is explicitly mentioned, it is tagged as [OUT], reflecting the adversarial sentiment toward the opposing team. The low win probability (17.6%) might further explain the frustration expressed in the comment. Hence, "packers" should be tagged [OUT], and there are no other referring expressions in the comment directly related to the in-group or other-group.	The commenter expresses a dislike for fans of the opposing team, the Packers. 'Packers' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team the commenter opposes. The in-group team here is the Bears, and there is no mention of them in this sentence. Thus, the word 'packers' is the explicit referring expression for the out-group, and should be tagged [OUT].	1670186854.0	bears	packers	Kyljani	Mack	7.0	0.175829648971558	[5]

['Jones', 'he']	[(15, 20), (52, 54)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The name 'Jones' refers to Aaron Jones, a player for the Packers, which is the in-group team. Since in-group team fans commonly discuss their own players in terms of their usage and injury potential, it makes sense that this comment is focused on a concern regarding an in-group player. Additionally, considering the very high win probability (97.0%) for the Packers, the commenter is likely speculating about future games and the well-being of their key player, indicating that 'Jones' and 'he' both refer to members of the in-group team. Therefore, both 'Jones' and 'he' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the same in-group player.	The commenter expresses concern for a player named Jones getting injured if he continues to carry a heavy load. Given the in-group is the Packers and the out-group is the Bears, the concern for the player's well-being indicates that Jones is likely a Packers player. Fans typically express worry for players on the team they support. Therefore, 'Jones' and 'he' should be tagged [IN], indicating that they both refer to a player on the in-group team, the Packers.	1663554643.0	packers	bears	Badgerst8		1.0	0.969883419573307	[5, 5]

The win probability is very low, indicating that the in-group is likely performing poorly, which could prompt a comment about their coach and their future prospects in a negative tone. Therefore, "Mike Zimmer" should be tagged with [IN], as it refers to a prominent member of the in-group team, and the whole sentence is implicitly about the Vikings' failure to make the playoffs, which further supports the [IN] tag.	The commenter mentions "Mike zimmer," who is the head coach of the Vikings, the in-group team. The statement is about the in-group coach never making the playoffs again, which signifies a pessimistic take on the in-group's future performance. Therefore, "Mike zimmer" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a key figure within the in-group team.	1636317944.0	vikings	ravens			1.0	0.095546776449425	[5]

'Dallas' refers to a player from the out-group, the Cowboys, hence it should be tagged [OUT]. The use of 'we' indicates the commenter identifies with the Broncos, the in-group team, and is celebrating their recovery of the ball, which aligns with the high win probability suggesting they are doing well. 'we' should therefore be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. This analysis makes the tags for both the in-group and out-group accurate for the respective entities mentioned.	The comment discusses a situation involving a Dallas player touching the ball past the line of scrimmage. This indicates that the Dallas player is from the out-group team, the Cowboys, so 'Dallas' is tagged as [OUT]. The phrase 'we recovered' implies that the commenter's team, the Broncos, recovered the ball, indicating that 'we' refers to the in-group. Thus, 'we' should be tagged as [IN]. Therefore, 'Dallas' is correctly tagged as [OUT] and 'we' is correctly tagged as [IN], resulting in the correct TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS.	1636314433.0	broncos	cowboys	manchester-scott		1.0	0.8587326407432561	[5, 5]

There is no explicit mention of the in-group, out-group, or other teams, but the context suggests an interest in the future of the in-group's coaching and management. Therefore, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team, and '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' accordingly.	The comment is likely about the in-group (Vikings), even though it doesn't mention specific players or coaches. The criticism about not wanting a running back as the highest paid player suggests concern with the team's management strategy. This is something a fan would typically be more interested in and upset about if it pertains to their own team. Therefore, the sentence should be tagged [IN] since, despite no explicit in-group reference, the comment implicitly refers to changes in the in-group team's management.	1634503040.0	vikings	panthers	well_shore		1.0	0.477572500705719	[5]

Despite the high win probability, suggesting the in-group is likely doing well overall, the commenter is expressing frustration about a specific issue, namely the team's defense not being healthy at once. "the whole defense" directly refers to an integral part of the in-group team. Therefore, "we" and "the whole defense" should be tagged as [IN] because they clearly refer to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter uses 'we,' which typically signals a reference to the in-group team they support, in this case, the Buccaneers. 'The whole defense' further specifies this reference to a sub-group within the Buccaneers, reinforcing that the sentence is about the in-group team. Fans usually talk about their team's struggles, such as injuries, thus 'we' and 'the whole defense' should both be tagged with [IN].	1642359401.0	buccaneers	eagles	Sparky01GT	:alstottjersey: Alstott Jersey	1.0	0.958955049514771	[5, 5]

The comment is praising Prater, describing him as "god tier," which would typically be done by a supporter of the player's team. Even though the win probability is relatively low, the positive mention is directed towards a player from the in-group. Therefore, 'Prater' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to a member of the in-group team.	Prater is a player on the Cardinals, and since the commenter supports the Cardinals, Prater is being referred to as part of the in-group. The comment praises Prater highly, calling him "god tier," which implies that the commenter is expressing admiration for a player from their own team.

The high win probability suggests that the Packers are performing well, so the commenter is likely discussing an in-group player's performance. The use of "Jones" without further context indicates it is a reference to a well-known player on the in-group team. "He" is also referring back to Jones, maintaining the context of the in-group. Therefore, both "Jones" and "he" should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group player. The comment reflects a critique or observation on Jones's performance, which aligns with a fan discussing their supported team.	The comment expresses a potential missed opportunity by a player named "Jones" to score a touchdown. Given that the in-group team is the Packers:1. **Jones:** Without additional context, the phrase "Jones" likely refers to Aaron Jones, a recognized player for the Packers, especially given the context of scoring in American football. Thus, "Jones" should be tagged as [IN].2. **he:** The pronoun "he" in the comment refers back to "Jones." Since "Jones" is a member of the in-group (Packers), "he" should also be tagged as [IN].Thus, the correct tagged output is that both "Jones" and "he" are part of the in-group, reflecting the commenter's analysis of an in-group player's performance.	1642905400.0	packers	49ers	aaalan71	:AronRoger:	12.0	0.870322227478027	[5, 5]

['[SENT]', 'AJ']	[(0, 6), (70, 72)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The high win probability indicates that the in-group is performing well, and the desire for a longer drive implies wanting to sustain the team's dominance. This is typical for a fan supporting their team. Thus, the first sentence implicitly refers to the in-group, so '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence specifically mentions 'AJ', referring to AJ Brown, a player on the Titans, which confirms that 'AJ' should be tagged as [IN]. Therefore, both the desire for a long drive and the comment about AJ are focused on the in-group team, supporting the provided tags.	The first sentence expresses a desire for a longer offensive drive, which is something a fan would wish for their own team. Since there's no explicit reference to the in-group, the sentence itself should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence mentions 'AJ,' which is likely referring to A.J. Brown, a player for the in-group team, the Titans. Therefore, 'AJ' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	1636341001.0	titans	rams			3.0	0.827864944934845	[5, 5]

The win probability is relatively low, suggesting the team is not performing well, which aligns with the negative sentiment in the comment. Since "this franchise" is a reference to the in-group team, the Commanders, it should be tagged [IN].	The phrase 'this franchise' is a disparaging remark about the team that the commenter supports, which indicates disappointment or frustration. Since fans typically use 'this' to refer to their own team in a negative context, especially when deeply disappointed or angry, 'this franchise' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, the Commanders.	1635097635.0	commanders	packers	Iamtheman1177	Fuck Dan Snyder	2.0	0.36134105920791604	[4]

['tampa', 'our o- line']	[(39, 44), (92, 103)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	The commenter is expressing frustration about the coverage of injuries. Specifically, they feel that the media or commentators excessively talk about the Buccaneers' (out-group) injuries but do not mention the significant inexperience of the Eagles' (in-group) offensive line. 'tampa' obviously refers to the Buccaneers and should be tagged [OUT]. The phrase 'our o- line' refers to the Eagles' offensive line, indicating possession and association with the in-group, so it should be tagged [IN]. The comment is implicitly contrasting the two teams, highlighting a perceived imbalance in injury reporting. Thus, 'tampa' and 'our o- line' should be tagged as 'OUT' and 'IN', respectively.	The commenter is complaining about the media's focus on the Buccaneers' injuries ("all the tampa injuries"), which indicates that "tampa" should be tagged as [OUT] because it refers to the out-group team. The phrase "our o-line" refers to the Eagles' offensive line, which the commenter supports. Therefore, "our o-line" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group. The overall frustration expressed by the commenter indicates a defensive stance toward their team, further supporting the tagging of in-group and out-group references appropriately.	1634258855.0	eagles	buccaneers			4.0	0.266735315322876	[5, 5]

The high win probability indicates that the team is likely doing well overall, but the commenter is focusing on a specific moment where the Chiefs stopped doing something effective. Therefore, the term "we" refers to the in-group (Chiefs) and is correctly tagged as [IN].	The use of 'we' indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team. In this context, 'we' is used to represent the in-group, which, according to the provided information, is the Chiefs. The commenter is likely frustrated with their own team's performance, suggesting that they have stopped doing what works. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Chiefs.	1637536435.0	chiefs	cowboys			2.0	0.929359793663025	[5]

[SENT] 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 	['#CAMERON JERELL NEWTON', 'PANTHER NATION']	[(7, 29), (59, 73)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment is excitedly celebrating Cameron Jerell Newton, a player for the Panthers, who is the in-group team the commenter supports. Despite the high win probability, the emotion indicated by the capital letters and excitement shows that they are praising their team/player. Thus, '#CAMERON JERELL NEWTON' refers to an in-group player, Cameron Newton, and should be tagged [IN]. 'PANTHER NATION' refers collectively to the team and its supporters, which includes the in-group, and should also be tagged [IN]. The 'WE' in 'WE BACK' implicitly refers to the Panthers, thus reinforcing the in-group support. The second sentence consisting of emojis doesn't contain any reference and is left untagged.	The commenter is clearly excited about Cameron Jerrell Newton, who is a well-known player for the Panthers, hence '#CAMERON JERELL NEWTON' should be tagged with [IN]. The reference to "PANTHER NATION" further solidifies the focus on the in-group, supporting the excitement and rallying cry for their own team, so 'PANTHER NATION' should also be tagged with [IN]. "WE" refers to the in-group supporters and team, indicating solidarity and shared enthusiasm, so it should be tagged [IN] as well.	1637521605.0	panthers	washington	killa_k99		27.0	0.72569103100839	[5, 5]

'we' in "Do we have issues?" clearly refers to the in-group (the Bills), thus it should be tagged [IN]. 'Miami' refers to the out-group team, the Dolphins, and should be tagged [OUT]. The final sentence "Better play calling would be good too" implicitly refers to the in-group team (Bills), suggesting that better strategies are needed, even though no specific words reference the in-group. Since there's an implicit focus on the in-group here, "[SENT]" should be tagged with [IN].	The comment captures the frustration of the commenter in a tied game. The use of the pronoun 'we' in "Do we have issues?" implicitly refers to the in-group team, which is the Bills, indicating the commenter is talking about their own team. Therefore, 'we' is tagged as [IN]. The phrase "Also Miami is playing their ass off to not get blown out again" mentions the specific name Miami, referring to the Dolphins, which is the out-group team. Hence, 'Miami' is tagged as [OUT].As for the sentence "Better play calling would be good too," it refers to a general improvement that the commenter wants for their in-group team without explicitly naming them. Therefore, the sentence is tagged [IN] implicitly.Other sentences like "Fucking classic," "Tied game," and "ITS THE END OF THE FUCKIN WORLD !" do not contain specific references to any team but describe the situation and emotion, hence remaining untagged.Thus, the tags and referring expressions correctly identify the references based on the context and the implicit way the commenter refers to their team and the opponent.	1635703202.0	bills	dolphins	Murslak		10.0	0.772465139627457	[5, 5, 5]

Since the in-group team is the 49ers and the win probability is almost evenly split, it implies a closely contested game where neither team is significantly outperforming the other. The second sentence "They shouldn't be struggling this much" is likely directed at the in-group 49ers, as fans typically express disappointment or frustration with their own team's performance. Therefore, "They" should be tagged as [IN] to reflect that it refers to the in-group. While the first sentence does not have an explicit referring expression, the overall context provided supports that the frustration is directed towards the in-group's performance. Thus, in the tagged output, "They" should be marked as [IN] signifying the commenter's in-group team, the 49ers.	The second sentence is expressing frustration about the performance of the team, indicating that the commenter feels the team they support should be performing better. This is typically the sentiment a fan has towards their own team. Therefore, the phrase 'They' should be tagged with [IN] as it is referring to the in-group team, the 49ers.	1668392123.0	49ers	chargers	SuperMario_49	:jerseyaway52: Patrick Willis	12.0	0.503518730401993	[5]

['the offense', 'the defense']	[(12, 23), (85, 96)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter appears to be evaluating both the offensive and defensive units within the in-group team, the 49ers. The mention of the offense not going out to celebrate suggests that they played responsibly, hinting that the offense belongs to the in-group. The subsequent comment on the defense appears to continue this evaluation by contrasting it with the offense, indicating a concern for the in-group team's overall performance. Therefore, 'the offense' and 'the defense' should both be tagged [IN], as they refer to units within the 49ers, the team the commenter supports. The overall high win probability suggests the 49ers are doing well, but the commenter is focused on critiquing a specific aspect (the defense right now) of the game, which is common in sports commentary.	The commenter is discussing their own team's performance critically but informatively. The phrase "the offense didn't go out and celebrate new years" suggests the offense of the in-group team, the 49ers, maintained discipline. The hesitation about the defense also likely concerns the in-group, as they seem to be underperforming ("not so sure about the defense"). Therefore, 'the offense' and 'the defense' should both be tagged with [IN] since they refer to respective units of the in-group team.	1672610431.0	49ers	raiders	Damion_205	:jerseyaway97: Bryant Young	3.0	0.781045347452164	[5, 5]

Since in-group supporters are more likely to praise their own players, TJ likely refers to a player on the in-group team, the Steelers. The win probability is almost 50%, suggesting a close game, but the commenter appears focused on celebrating the player's performance rather than the game's outcome. The phrase 'Guy needs a good offseason to heal up' further implies a concern for this player's well-being and future performance, reinforcing that 'Guy' also refers to the same in-group player, TJ. Thus, both 'TJ' and 'Guy' should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to an in-group player.	This is a game between the Steelers and the Ravens, and TJ (T.J. Watt) is a prominent player for the Steelers. The comment is complimentary, calling TJ a 'fucking boss,' which is something a fan would typically say about a player from the team they support. Thus, 'TJ' and 'Guy' are being used to refer to T.J. Watt, who is part of the in-group.

The reference to Belichick, who is the head coach of the Patriots, reinforces that the comment is about the in-group team. Despite the low win probability, which suggests the Patriots are performing poorly, the critique is directed at their own team. Thus, 'Belichick' should be tagged [IN], referring to the in-group.	The commenter refers to "the most spineless team Belichick has ever fielded," which indicates that they are criticizing their own team's performance. Bill Belichick is the head coach of the Patriots, the in-group team. Thus, the criticism coming from the commenter is directed towards their own team, making 'Belichick' correspond to the in-group.

The entirety of the comment talks about his injury and expresses concern for his well-being. The injury and the pain described should be of particular interest to a fan of the in-group team. Thus 'Fitzpatrick', 'he', 'him', and 'his hand' all refer to the in-group player and should be tagged with [IN]. Because no other entities or teams are mentioned or implied within these sentences, referring expressions should consistently be tagged as in-group [IN] given the context and the focus on Fitzpatrick.	The commenter is supporting the Steelers and Fitzpatrick is a player for the Steelers, thus any reference to Fitzpatrick refers to the in-group. 'Fitzpatrick' in the first sentence and subsequent pronouns 'he', 'him', and 'his hand' across the sentences should be tagged [IN] since they refer to the in-group player who is currently injured. The use of pronouns like 'he' and 'him' indicate continuity in referring to Fitzpatrick throughout the comment.	1636918476.0	steelers	lions	keji_goto	Quack	2.0	0.665339946746826	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

Given the low win probability for the Falcons, it suggests a pessimistic outlook from the commenter's perspective, expecting the opposing team to make a significant play. Although the comment doesn't explicitly mention the Buccaneers, the context implies that the Buccaneers are poised to execute a lengthy drive. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged as [OUT] since the implication of the statement is directed towards the out-group team.	The commenter is anticipating a significant drive likely by the out-group team. This expectation of a long, successful drive tends to indicate that the commenter is talking about the opponent, as it implies frustration or resignation. Since no specific players or team names are mentioned directly, the sentence itself ("[SENT]") is tagged with [OUT] to reflect that the comment is referring implicitly to the out-group team, the Buccaneers.	1632091328.0	falcons	buccaneers	italianstallion2		4.0	0.18886840343475297	[5]

'Dean' is referred to without any negative comment, implying in-group support given it is common for fans to refrain from shitting on their own players. Thus, 'Dean' is tagged as [IN], referring to a player from the Buccaneers. 'hurts', however, is mentioned in a negative context ('horrible game'), aligning with typical behavior of fans pointing out flaws in opponents. 'hurts' is a player for the Eagles, so he is tagged [OUT]. The high win probability for the Buccaneers further supports the interpretation that the commenter is calmly addressing both an in-group player and an out-group opponent. Therefore, 'Dean' should be tagged [IN], and 'hurts' should be tagged [OUT].	The commenter states that they are "not shitting on Dean," implying that Dean is a player on the in-group team (Buccaneers). They then mention "hurts," criticizing the performance, which suggests that Hurts is a player from the out-group (Eagles). Thus, 'Dean' should be tagged with [IN] and 'hurts' with [OUT]. The commenter supports the Buccaneers and is not disparaging their own player while criticizing an opponent, making the tagging appropriate.	1634263820.0	buccaneers	eagles	TBCat	:maui: Maui Vea	1.0	0.9677424728870392	[5, 5]
test	ruixmr	hqzzc4d	t1_hqzz8kn	[SENT] Ask Shurmur 	[SENT] Ask [IN] 	['Shurmur']	[(11, 18)]	['[IN]']	The extremely low win probability indicates that the Broncos are not performing well at the time of the comment. Shurmur, referring to Pat Shurmur, is the offensive coordinator for the Broncos. The commenter is likely pointing out their dissatisfaction by suggesting that Shurmur is responsible in some way. Because Shurmur is part of the in-group team's organization, the reference to 'Shurmur' should be tagged as [IN].	'Shurmur' refers to Pat Shurmur, who is a coach for the Broncos. Since the commenter supports the Broncos and Pat Shurmur is part of the in-group team, the tag [IN] is appropriate. The commenter is likely expressing frustration or seeking information about the Broncos' performance from a member of their own team. Therefore, 'Shurmur' should be tagged with [IN].	1641165642.0	broncos	chargers	NewGen24	:CWxQy4O:	2.0	0.014932951889932045	[5]

['offensive coaches']	[(32, 49)]	['[IN]']	The comment is likely discussing the in-group team since the commenter is analyzing the performance of the offensive coaches, suggesting that they either are learning or simply lucky, without it being explicitly disparaging or positive. This kind of analysis typically comes from a supporter who is invested in the nuances of their team's performance. Therefore, 'offensive coaches' should be tagged as [IN] because the commenter is referring to the Chargers' coaches. The lack of specific mentions of the out-group in this comment further supports that 'offensive coaches' must be referring to the in-group. The win probability is relatively balanced, indicating a closely contested game, which often prompts detailed scrutiny of the in-group's performance.	The comment is expressing uncertainty about the performance of the offensive coaches, which is more indicative of discussing the in-group team critically but without outright condemnation. This type of nuanced critique is more likely directed at the team the commenter supports. Thus, 'offensive coaches' in the second sentence is tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group (Chargers). The first sentence 'Wow' does not provide any explicit reference to an entity, hence it remains untagged.	1665337841.0	chargers	browns	Misanthropyandme		2.0	0.45568565586507503	[5]

The comment is a disparaging remark implying a lack of trust in Cook's effectiveness, which aligns with the emotional investment fans typically exhibit towards their own team's players. Even though the win probability is high for the in-group, suggesting they are likely to win, fans can still make critical comments about specific players' performances. Therefore, 'Cook' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	Dalvin Cook is a well-known player for the Minnesota Vikings. The comment, "I don't think I'd let Cook run my errands," expresses a lack of faith in Cook, which aligns with a fan criticizing their own team's player. Therefore, 'Cook' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group entity, given the in-group is the Vikings and Cook is a member of that team.	1665946334.0	vikings	dolphins	The_Only_Abe	Purple to pale in 60 seconds	6.0	0.80205911397934	[5]

REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['He', 'him', 'his targets', 'He', 'his hands']The win probability of 0.0% indicates that the in-group (Patriots) is clearly losing or has lost the game, which influences the negative tone of the comment. The use of "He" and subsequent pronouns "him," "his targets," and "his hands" implicitly refer to the quarterback of the in-group team, who is being criticized for poor performance. The absence of any reference to the out-group opponent (Jets	The comment is critical of specific actions, likely targeting an in-group player, which in this case is a player from the Patriots. The use of "He" without further qualification suggests the commenter assumes the audience knows who "He" refers to, often indicative of a familiar in-group player. The commenter is providing feedback and criticism, a common behavior among fans who are invested in their team's performance. Therefore, 'He', 'him', 'his targets', 'He', and 'his hands' should all be tagged as [IN], as they refer to the in-group player.	1667163803.0	patriots	jets	jonnyredshorts	:jersey80:	1.0	0.0	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

Since it is in past tense and it says "oh wait," it implies Bowles is no longer with the Jets and is likely with another team, thus making him an [OTHER]. The second sentence, "Sorry just watched 3rd down," doesn't contain any explicit referring expressions but is reacting to a specific play without directly specifying which team is involved. The overall low win probability suggests frustration, which aligns with the sarcastic tone when mentioning a former coach, justifying the label [OTHER] for "Bowles."	Todd Bowles was the head coach for the New York Jets but is no longer associated with them. Given this historical context, 'Bowles' should be tagged as [OTHER] because he is not currently part of the in-group (Jets) or the out-group (Falcons). The use of his name suggests the commenter is referring to past experiences with Bowles, thus making him part of some other context rather than the specific game at hand. The rest of the comment does not have explicit references to the in-group or out-group, but since there are no tags necessary for phrases like '3rd down', only 'Bowles' is tagged correctly as [OTHER].	1633882332.0	jets	falcons	anonymous_reader		5.0	0.10316681861877397	[5]

['Our leading receiver', 'we']	[(7, 27), (115, 117)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment uses "Our leading receiver" in the first sentence, and "we" in the second sentence, both of which are common ways fans refer to their own team. The win probability is extremely low, indicating that the Patriots are likely losing significantly at this point in the game. Despite the low chance of winning, the commenter still highlights a positive aspect of the Patriots' season, implying a sense of pride and support for their team despite the current game's outcome. Therefore, "Our leading receiver" and "we" refer to the in-group team, the Patriots. Hence, both sentences should be tagged [IN], and "Our leading receiver" and "we" should be tagged as referring to the in-group.	The use of 'Our leading receiver' and 'we' directly indicates that the commenter is talking about their own team, the in-group, which is the Patriots in this context. 'Our leading receiver' refers to a player from the in-group, and 'we' is a pronoun commonly used to denote the in-group team with which the commenter identifies. The comment praises the performance of the team's leading receiver despite the perceived lack of overall talent on the offense, something a fan would typically discuss about their own team rather than their opponent. Therefore, both 'Our leading receiver' and 'we' should be tagged with [IN].	1642302953.0	patriots	bills	Rampant_baconator	GOAT	2.0	0.0006549868267029524	[5, 5]

Since 'Oklahoma' and 'chiefs' are both entities the commenter supports, they should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability is relatively low (26.6%), indicating the Chiefs are likely losing, which explains why the commenter is finding it rough to be a fan this weekend. Thus, 'Oklahoma' and 'chiefs' should be tagged [IN].	The commenter is expressing difficulty related to being a fan of both the Oklahoma team (likely referring to the Oklahoma Sooners, a college football team) and the Chiefs. They are mentioning their support for both entities in the context of a rough weekend. Since the Chiefs are the in-group professional team and the context of the comment suggests a connection to being a fan, both 'Oklahoma' and 'chiefs' are tagged as [IN]. This explains why the reference to the 'Oklahoma' team, even though it is a college team, and 'chiefs' are tagged as [IN].	1632679366.0	chiefs	chargers	Jkwhjr		2.0	0.265739381313324	[5, 5]

'The 3' is referring to the opponent team (Washington) scoring three points, indicated by the win probability suggesting that the in-group team (Commanders) is likely trailing. Hence, '[SENT]' in the first sentence should be tagged [OUT].In the second sentence, the phrase 'the offense' refers to the Commanders' offensive unit, given the context that it's their turn to respond. Thus, 'the offense' is tagged [IN].The third sentence shows an urging need for the in-group team (Commanders) to mount an effective offensive drive, underlining the desire for a more substantial and game-changing action. Consequently, '[SENT]' implicitly refers to the in-group and should be tagged [IN] again.The referring expressions (both implicit and explicit mentions) correctly align to the respective teams based on the context of competitive sports commentary and knowledge of typical fan language patterns.	The first sentence refers to settling for a field goal ('The 3') for the opposing team, hence it should be tagged [OUT]. The second and third sentences indicate a shift in focus to the commenter's team, as they are preparing for the offensive drive. 'the offense' in the second sentence is likely referring to the in-group, since the commenter wants them to perform well. Therefore, the second sentence itself should be tagged [IN], and the third sentence implicitly refers to the in-group's need for success, so it should be tagged [IN] as well.	1671420500.0	commanders	washington	_LilDuck	Fuck Dan Snyder	1.0	0.328873753547668	[5, 5, 5]

The expression "is a fucking dogggggg" is a complimentary and enthusiastic description of the player's performance, which is typical of fans praising their own team members. The win probability is relatively balanced, so the comment is more focused on appreciating an individual player's performance rather than the state of the game. Therefore, "Renfrow" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	The commenter is praising Renfrow, calling him "a fucking dog," which is a positive and enthusiastic compliment. Renfrow is a player for the Raiders, the in-group team. Fans typically praise players from their own team, which aligns with the in-group sentiment.

Given the context and the win probability, it is likely the commenter is frustrated with a player from their own team since they think 'He' shouldn't be allowed back. Typically, fans direct such pointed criticisms at their own players rather than the opponents. Therefore, 'He' should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to an in-group player.	The commenter likely refers to someone on their own team, the Jets, who performed poorly, as this kind of critical comment is usually directed at one's own players. Thus, 'He' should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to a member of the in-group team.	1671395104.0	jets	lions	budlightismyvacseen	:LogoRetroWordmark:	4.0	0.352501541376114	[5]

The term 'Perfect ending' suggests the commenter is focusing on a moment involving their own team in a positive light despite the win probability being 0.0%, hinting that the game is lost but they still found satisfaction in this particular play. Consequently, 'Defo' is tagged with [IN], acknowledging that the sack was made by a player from the in-group.	The mentioned player, "Defo," refers to DeForest Buckner, a defensive tackle for the Colts. Since the commenter is a Colts supporter and is celebrating the ending of a game with a Buckner sack, "Defo" is directly linked to the in-group.

The comment speaks generally to the strategy of needing a touchdown, which suggests frustration directed at the in-group team's play-calling or execution. Since there is no explicit reference to the in-group or out-group teams, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is implicitly discussing the in-group team. Therefore, the entire sentence is tagged as [IN], even though there are no specific words or phrases to tag.	The comment expresses frustration and offers advice presumably for the in-group team that the commenter supports. When a fan provides a critique or suggestion on play strategy, it is typically directed towards their own team's actions and decisions. The phrase "when you need a touchdown on 3rd and goal try throwing it in the actual end zone" is indicative of a specific game situation that the in-group team, the Raiders, likely found themselves in. There is no explicit mention of the in-group team, but the context implies the criticism is toward the team the commenter is invested in, thus the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN].	1642292658.0	raiders	bengals	Joephats		3.0	0.05496982857584998	[5]

'We' is a commonly used term by fans to refer to their own team, indicating a sense of belonging and support. 'The defense' is specified without additional qualification, suggesting that it refers to the in-group team's defense. The overall tone of the comment shows dissatisfaction with their own team's performance, specifically mentioning the need to improve offensive productivity. Therefore, 'We' and 'the defense' should both be tagged as [IN] because they refer to the in-group team, the Steelers.	The commenter is expressing frustration with their team's current performance, particularly focusing on the defense and the need to move the ball. The word 'We' typically refers to the in-group team with which the commenter identifies, since fans often use 'we' to express a collective stance regarding their team's performance. Similarly, 'the defense' is being criticized for being overburdened, which implies that this is a discussion about the in-group's defensive unit. Therefore, the phrases 'We' and 'the defense' are tagged with [IN] to indicate they refer to the in-group (Steelers).	1641759087.0	steelers	ravens	Too_Hood_95	The Bus	3.0	0.267605364322662	[5, 5]

Given the context, this kind of cheering is likely directed toward a player on the in-group team, the Seahawks, especially given the high win probability, suggesting that the team is performing well and fans are in good spirits. Therefore, 'Kevin' should be tagged as [IN] since he refers to an in-group player.	The comment uses a playful and supportive tone ('WOOF WOOF') that fans often use when referring to their own players. 'Kevin' here refers to a player from the in-group Seahawks, as evidenced by the use of an affectionate nickname.

Given the context, these criticisms are aimed at the in-group, the Pittsburgh Steelers. With the Steelers indicated as the in-group team that the commenter supports, and the very low win probability suggesting the team is performing poorly, it makes sense that the comment reflects a critique of internal decisions.1. "Tomlin" refers to Mike Tomlin, the head coach of the Steelers, thus it should be tagged as [IN].2. The phrase "some of the worst coordinators in the league" is referring to the coordinators that were hired by Tomlin, thus they are part of the in-group and should be tagged as [IN].3. "Ben" refers to Ben Roethlisberger, the quarterback for the Steelers, hence should be tagged as [IN].4. "he" also refers to Ben Roethlisberger, maintaining continuity in the criticism towards the same player, so it also should be tagged as [IN].Overall, each of these references is directly linked to the in-group entities involved in the perceived issues contributing to the team's poor performance. This is why the provided TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS are correct based on the input details and context.EXPLANATION:	The complaint in the comment seems focused on the internal workings of the in-group team (Steelers). The negative tone suggests frustration with the team's decisions, which indicates that the entities referred to are related to the in-group rather than the out-group (Bengals). - "Tomlin" is a direct reference to Mike Tomlin, the head coach of the Steelers, thus [IN].- "some of the worst coordinators in the league" refers to personnel decisions made within the in-group team, thus [IN].- "Ben" refers to Ben Roethlisberger, the quarterback for the Steelers, making this an [IN] reference.- "he" in this case refers to Ben Roethlisberger, continuing the sentiment from the previous sentence where "Ben" was mentioned, thus [IN].Therefore, the comment refers internally to the in-group, criticizing elements of their own team, which justifies the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS as correct.	1638128504.0	steelers	bengals			10.0	0.0025987778790299565	[5, 5, 5, 5]

The first sentence, "Needed that stop," is implicitly about the in-group, the Cowboys, hinting that their defense succeeded in stopping the opponent's play, which aligns with the low win probability as moments like this can bring hope. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged '[IN]' since the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group.In the second sentence, "Offense, time to do your job and put up some points," the commenter explicitly addresses the offense, urging them to score. This shows a clear focus on the in-group's (Cowboys') offense. Hence, 'Offense' should be tagged '[IN]' because it refers to the in-group team working to improve the game situation.Thus, the targets '[IN]' for the first sentence and '[IN]' for 'Offense' in the second sentence are accurate, reflecting the in-group focus.	The first sentence, "Needed that stop," implies that a defensive action was successful for the in-group team the commenter supports without explicitly mentioning a team. Thus, the entire sentence is tagged [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group team needing and successfully getting a stop against the opponent. In the second sentence, "Offense" is a direct reference to the in-group's offensive unit, as the commenter is motivating them to score points, something they would typically encourage their own team to do. Therefore, "Offense" should be tagged [IN]. The "[SENT]" token in the second sentence gets the [IN] tag because the commenter is implicitly addressing their own team as well.	1636313928.0	cowboys	broncos	airwatts		1.0	0.269136667251587	[5, 5]

['he', 'his']	[(14, 16), (48, 51)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]']	The win probability is very high, indicating that the Eagles are likely winning. The comment is reflective and in past tense about a player who has supported the team well, suggesting they are referring to a player who used to be on the Eagles. However, since the comment suggests a tone of moving on or appreciation for past support, "he" and "his" likely refer to a player who was formerly with the Eagles but is currently playing for another team. Therefore, this player would not be part of the in-group (current team) but part of another team (other), hence the tags of [OTHER] for "he" and "his". 'us' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, hence properly tagged [IN].	The comment seems to be referring to a player who has been a support to the team for a while. The terms 'he' and 'his' are not specific to either the in-group (Eagles) or the out-group (Cowboys), and since the comment does not contain any identifier to a player from either team, it is inferred that this player is from some other team in the NFL, hence the tag [OTHER] for 'he' and 'his'. Additionally, 'us' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group (Eagles), but isn't explicitly listed in the tagged expressions.	1665972107.0	eagles	cowboys	MisterxRager		2.0	0.980824768543243	[3, 3]

['we', 'Hurts', 'we']	[(50, 52), (100, 105), (133, 135)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is expressing frustration and hypothetical reflection on the game strategy of the in-group team, the Eagles. The first sentence doesn't provide any specific entity, so it doesn't require tagging. The second sentence uses "we," which typically indicates the in-group team since the commenter is referring to actions that should have been taken by the Eagles. The third sentence mentions "Hurts," a player for the Eagles, implying his performance has improved following a change in strategy. The use of "we" again in the same sentence demonstrates an inclusive reference to the in-group. Given the 100% win probability, the commenter feels secure in reflecting on past strategy missteps with the benefit of hindsight, thus reinforcing the in-group perspective.Thus:- "we" in the second sentence refers to the Eagles ([IN]).- "Hurts" in the third sentence refers to an Eagles player ([IN]).- "we" in the third sentence again refers to the Eagles ([IN]).This results in "[IN]" tags for the second and third sentences when referring to actions or players of the in-group team.The commenter is reflecting on the past strategy of the Eagles and how their gameplay has evolved. The use of "we" and "Hurts" specifically refers to the	The comment expresses a hypothetical situation and an opinion about the team's performance, which typically comes from a fan of the team. The word "we" usually indicates an in-group reference, suggesting the commenter is talking about their own team, the Eagles. Additionally, the mention of "Hurts," who is a player for the Eagles, further emphasizes this focus on the in-group team.Thus, "we" in the second sentence should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, the Eagles. Similarly, "Hurts" and "we" in the third sentence should also be tagged [IN], as they refer to the in-group's quarterback and the in-group team respectively.Therefore, the targeting and referring expressions are correct as it describes an in-group perspective on the team's past strategies and current performance where "we" and "Hurts" specifically denote the entities within the Eagles team.	1637528868.0	eagles	saints	Kryptyx		10.0	0.999683822446968	[5, 5, 5]

The comment is pointing out that Metcalf is wide open, which implies either a lapse in in-group team (Cardinals) defense or a good play by the out-group (Seahawks). Since Metcalf is a player for the Seahawks, he should be tagged as [OUT]. The win probability is relatively low for the in-group team, suggesting they might be struggling, further supporting the focus on an out-group player making a play. Therefore, "Metcalf" is correctly tagged as [OUT].	Metcalf, in this context, refers to DK Metcalf, a player for the Seahawks. Since the Seahawks are the out-group opponent, 'Metcalf' should be tagged with [OUT]. The comment does not mention any other entities, and the overall sentiment suggests criticism or concern from a Cardinals' fan perspective, further supporting the identification of an out-group player.	1665959071.0	cardinals	seahawks	Marleyp199523	:cardinals: Cardinals	5.0	0.29905402660369895	[5]

['Hump']	[(19, 23)]	['[IN]']	'Hump' likely refers to Marlon Humphrey, a well-known player for the Ravens. The high win probability suggests that the in-group (Ravens) is performing well, which is in line with the emotional investment of the commenter in Humphrey's play. The first 'Damn' sentence doesn't contain a specific entity reference, so it remains untagged. Therefore, 'Hump' is tagged [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team, the Ravens.	'Hump' refers to Marlon Humphrey, a cornerback for the Baltimore Ravens, which is the in-group team. The commenter expresses disappointment, which aligns with fans showing concern for their own team's performance. Therefore, 'Hump' should be tagged as [IN], and the sentence without an explicit reference should be recognized for its in-group context as well.	1634493686.0	ravens	chargers	Bigtoes22		2.0	0.924990497529507	[5]

Despite the high win probability for the in-group, in-the-moment emotional reactions to poor plays can lead to such expressions of frustration. 'Team' in the second sentence is explicitly referring to the in-group, Colts, as the commenter is critiquing their performance. The first sentence doesn't have an explicit referring expression but is clearly about the in-group given the context of the commenter's support and the nature of the criticisms. Thus '[SENT]' in the first sentence and 'Team' in the second sentence should be tagged with '[IN]'.	The comment is expressing extreme frustration and disappointment, which is indicative of someone critiquing their own team's performance. Fans are usually the ones who passionately criticize their own team. The first sentence does not contain any explicit mention of an entity but is clearly criticizing someone, likely the in-group team, hence it is tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, "Team" is explicitly mentioned and blamed, suggesting that the commenter is angry at the in-group. Thus, "Team" should be tagged as [IN].The commenter is clearly unhappy with the performance, a sentiment typically expressed towards their own team. The first "[SENT]" is implicitly criticizing the performance of the in-group, hence it should be tagged as [IN]. The word "Team" refers to the in-group team that the commenter believes deserves to be booed, so it is also tagged as [IN].	1636923271.0	colts	jaguars	ZusunicStudio	Playoffs?

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The sentence discusses a play action and a foul, which are specific events that would typically elicit a reaction from a commenter who is engaged in the game. Given the win probability is close to 50%, it is in a competitive state, and such comments are likely reflecting the in-group team's actions or responses. Although the comment doesn't explicitly mention the Titans (in-group), it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is talking about their own team based on the context of the comment. Therefore, the entire sentence can be tagged implicitly as referring to the in-group ([IN]), even though there are no explicit referring expressions.	The comment mentions "play action" and a "foul," which is likely to be a complaint or observation about a recent play involving the in-group team (Titans). Since there are no explicit references to the in-group or out-group, the sentence itself is tagged [IN] since the comment is implicitly about the in-group team's actions and the context is a game between the Titans and Bengals.	1669580163.0	titans	bengals	BM-P8		2.0	0.540715754032135	[2]

The comment's lighthearted tone amidst a 0.0% win probability suggests the commenter is trying to find a small positive aspect in the performance of an in-group player. Hence, 'PJ' should be tagged with [IN], acknowledging that the comment is about the in-group team.	The mentioned player, "PJ," refers to PJ Walker, who is a player for the Panthers (in-group). The phrase "drink and dunk" is used in a somewhat light-hearted, possibly appreciative manner, indicating the commenter is talking about a player from the in-group.

['Cleveland', 'Cleveland', 'Buffalo']	[(43, 52), (64, 73), (108, 115)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[OUT]']	The commenter is a Bills supporter, and they mention both 'Cleveland' and 'Buffalo' in the context of the NFL game between the Bills and the Browns. 1. The second sentence, "Good thing Cleveland is beating Cleveland, lol," uses 'Cleveland' twice. Given that in-group supporters sometimes humorously refer to their own team when they are making mistakes, this instance of 'Cleveland' likely refers to the Bills (in-group) self-sabotaging or not performing as expected. Therefore, both instances of 'Cleveland' should be tagged as [IN].2. In the third sentence, "Doesn't look like Buffalo will," 'Buffalo' clearly refers to the Bills, which is the in-group team. Meanwhile, the sentence implies that 'Buffalo' (Bills) won't be able to beat Cleveland (Browns), but since Cleveland was tagged as [IN] before, it changes the context. Since there's likely an intended shift where the real competition is against Buffalo (Bills), we infer Buffalo's opponent in this context is the Browns hence 'will' refers back to Browns [OUT].  Therefore, 'Cleveland' should be tagged as [IN] in the second sentence, and 'Buffalo	The commenter supports the Bills (the in-group) and refers to the Bills' situation positively at first. When mentioning "Cleveland is beating Cleveland," they are making a joke about the Browns (the out-group) performing poorly against themselves, implying they are not a threat, which is why both expressions of "Cleveland" should be tagged as [IN] since they implicitly support the in-group through this sarcastic comment. The phrase "Doesn't look like Buffalo will" refers to the Bills, but is expressed in a context that acknowledges a challenge or difficulty, hence this should be tagged as [OUT] to indicate the opponent.Overall, the use of oppositional references in the context of favorable outcomes for the commenter's team supports these tags. The use of sarcasm and challenge references are linguistic markers that justify these tags.	1668970333.0	bills	browns	EdgarsChainsaw	12	5.0	0.462566673755646	[5, 5, 5]

Since 'zach' is a player on the Jets (the in-group team), the name 'zach' should be tagged as [IN]. Similarly, 'his' refers to Zach and should also be tagged as [IN]. Additionally, 'our entire offensive staff' refers to the offensive staff of the in-group team, indicating the Jets. Despite the low win probability, the focus is on the internal issues of the in-group team. Thus, 'our entire offensive staff' should be tagged as [IN]. The in-group team is the Jets, and all the referring expressions 'zach', 'his', and 'our entire offensive staff' are directly related to the Jets, justifying their [IN] tagging.	The commenter is discussing Zach Wilson, a player for the Jets, indicating that "zach" refers to an in-group player. The phrase "his lack of development" continues to refer to Zach Wilson, an in-group player, hence "his" should be tagged [IN].

Therefore, these references are tagged as [OTHER] since they refer to another team and its players, not involved in the current matchup.In the first sentence, 'cardinals', 'Josh rosen', 'him', 'Cardinals', and 'qb' all refer to the Arizona Cardinals and its players during the 2019 season. In the second sentence, 'Kyler' and 'rosen' are also players from the Cardinals team. The final sentence draws a comparison implicitly involving Zach Wilson (Jets quarterback) and Josh Rosen, but 'wilson' is mentioned directly. Therefore, 'wilson' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team player.Overall, the tagging reflects entities from another NFL team as [OTHER], while the only reference relevant to the Jets is tagged [IN]. Hence, 'wilson' is tagged [IN] and the rest as [OTHER].	The comment primarily talks about the Arizona Cardinals and two of their former players, Josh Rosen and Kyler Murray, referring to their performance and the decisions made by the Cardinals' front office (fo).

The phrase "we" typically signifies a sense of affiliation and support, indicating that the speaker identifies with the group being mentioned. Here, "we" is used to refer to the in-group team, the 49ers. The commenter implies that the current quarterback system isn't working well for their team, thus implicitly criticizing their own team's strategy or performance. Hence, 'we' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The word 'we' typically refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, in this case, the 49ers.

Given the win probability is 0.0%, the Eagles are almost certainly set to lose, which supports the critical tone towards their own quarterback. Thus, 'he' in both instances in the first sentence and second sentence refers to the in-group quarterback, and should be tagged with [IN]. The 'They' in the second sentence likely refers to the opposing team, the Buccaneers, who are in control and forcing the Eagles into an unfavorable situation. Thus 'They' should be tagged with [OUT]. This explains the correct tagging for the expressions and the sentences.

In this context, "He" likely refers to a player on the 49ers who the commenter believes is underutilized and should get "more touches" (a phrase that implies increased involvement in the game, often used for running backs or wide receivers).

This indicates that the 'Bills' are an other group ([OTHER]) in this context. The win probability suggests that the Dolphins have a fair chance of winning, so this expression of support for the Bills could be tied to another game or a broader playoff picture where the performance of the Bills could indirectly benefit the Dolphins. Hence, 'Bills' should be tagged [OTHER].	The commenter supports the Dolphins and is playing against the Jets, but expresses support for the Bills, who are another team in the NFL. This support for the Bills implies they are not part of the in-group (Dolphins) or the out-group (Jets).

Darrell Williams is a player for the Chiefs, the in-group team the commenter supports. The phrase 'You guys' suggests that the commenter is addressing other supporters or viewers regarding inquiries about Williams's injury status. The win probability being moderately high indicates a competitive but not assured win situation, matching the tone of addressing player availability. Therefore, 'Darrell Williams' should be tagged [IN] as it directly refers to the in-group player Darrell Williams.Additionally, the rest of the sentences don't include explicit references to either the in-group or out-group but follow in response to the first sentence's mention of Darrell Williams, reinforcing the in-group context.Thus, the tag '[IN]' is correct for 'Darrell Williams', and there are no further explicit references necessitating additional tags in the remaining sentences.	Darrell Williams is a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Darrell Williams' should be tagged as [IN], as he is part of the in-group.

Given the context of the comment and the lack of any specific identifiers indicating it is about the in-group (Bills), "he" is interpreted as an out-group entity. Despite the relatively high win probability for the Bills, the excitement or attention surrounding a returning player is more prominent, prompting the commenter to highlight this event. Therefore, "he" should be tagged with [OUT], and the rest of the sentence does not contain explicit references that need tagging.	The comment uses 'he' in an excited or exclamatory way, implying a notable or impactful player. Since the in-group is the Bills and the out-group is the Dolphins, the excitement around 'he' being back suggests this player is likely a significant figure from the out-group team. This is further implied by the absence of any derogatory context which would typically accompany an in-group reference.

The commenter is frustrated about the poor performance, indicated by "SO BAD" and "HOW DO WE KEEP LETTING THIS HAPPEN," which signifies a personal investment in the team.

Thus, "This team" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group, and '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because the entire comment is implicitly referring to the in-group team.	1640548557.0	patriots	bills	RELAXNMAXN		1.0	0.108318746089935	[5]

['Amani', 'He', 'he']	[(11, 16), (58, 60), (88, 90)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is likely referring to Amani Oruwariye, a player for the Lions, given the context of the comment and the mention of his past performance ('He was good last year'). Despite the win probability indicating that the Lions are slightly favored, the commenter is criticizing Amani's performance this season, which shows they are focusing on the player's decline rather than the overall state of the game. Therefore, 'Amani' should be tagged as [IN] since he is a player for the in-group team. The pronouns 'He' and 'he' in the subsequent sentences refer to Amani and thus should also be tagged as [IN]. The sentences without explicit reference names but implying the player still refer to the same in-group entity. Therefore, [IN] is the correct tag for these references.	Amani Oruwariye is a player for the in-group team, the Lions. The commenter is questioning his performance, which indicates that 'Amani' refers to the in-group. 'He' and 'he' in the subsequent sentences also refer back to Amani. Since the critique and concern are about a player from the in-group, these referring expressions 'Amani', 'He', and 'he' should be tagged with [IN]. There are no references to the out-group or other teams in the NFL in this comment.	1667156119.0	lions	dolphins	5-Star_Fraud	Hail Martha full of grace	1.0	0.560207545757294	[5, 5, 5]

The derogatory term "BUM ASS DONKEYS" is a common disparaging nickname for the Broncos, solidifying that the entire comment is directed at the out-group. Hence, '[SENT]' should be tagged [OUT], referring implicitly to the Broncos' fans leaving the stadium early due to the team's poor performance.	The commenter is mocking the fans of the Broncos (referred to here as "BUM ASS DONKEYS"), implying derision towards the out-group. The fact that they are noting fans leaving the stadium and expressing joy ('bahahah') suggests they are talking about the out-group's fans. Even though there isn't an explicit mention of the Broncos in this sentence, the context and derogatory nickname make it clear that '[SENT]' should be tagged as [OUT]. Thus, the entire comment implicitly refers to the out-group.	1634512838.0	raiders	broncos	JasonCaC		15.0	0.9969453215599061	[5]

In this context, the comment 'I know, it's so rare to see him fumble the ball' likely refers to a player on the in-group team because fans are generally more aware of and more inclined to discuss the performance (good or bad) of players on their own team. The word 'him' should therefore be tagged as [IN] since it most plausibly refers to an in-group player who unexpectedly fumbled the ball, which is significant enough to be remarked upon by a supporter.	The comment expresses surprise at a rare event involving 'him,' who fumbled the ball. It is natural for a commenter to highlight the unusual mistakes of a player from their own team rather than focusing on the mistakes of an opponent. Thus, the word 'him' is likely referring to a player from the in-group (the Giants), as the commenter is expressing shock over an uncommon negative performance. Accordingly, 'him' should be tagged with [IN].	1662930962.0	giants	titans	I__Need__Scissors_61		-2.0	0.08148926496505704	[5]

['We', 'the Dolphins']	[(32, 34), (56, 68)]	['[IN]', '[OTHER]']	The first sentence, "This is the way," doesn't contain specific references to in-group, out-group, or other entities, so it is left untagged. In the second sentence, "We fucked it up against the Dolphins and it made me so mad," the pronoun "We" is referring to the commenter's team, the Bills, making it an in-group reference. The term "the Dolphins" refers to a team that is neither the Bills (in-group) nor the Bears (out-group), thus it's tagged as [OTHER]. The win probability is relatively high, indicating the Bills are doing well overall, but the commenter is recalling a past mistake against a different team, which provides context for the reflective nature of the comment. So "We" is tagged with [IN] and "the Dolphins" is tagged with [OTHER].	The first sentence lacks a specific reference to any team, so it remains untagged. In the second sentence, the word "We" indicates the in-group team, the Bills, as the commenter is discussing a game where they felt upset about their own team's performance. The phrase "the Dolphins" refers to a team that is neither the in-group (Bills) nor the out-group (Bears), thus it should be tagged as [OTHER].	1671908675.0	bills	bears			2.0	0.6452295184135439	[5, 5]

The extremely low win probability suggests that the Broncos are almost certainly going to lose, leading to a critical comment about their performance. "russ" likely refers to Russell Wilson, the quarterback for the Broncos. Therefore, "We" and "russ" should be tagged as [IN] since both refer to individuals or groups associated with the in-group team.	The term 'We' generally refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports, which is the Broncos in this case. The expression 'russ' likely refers to Russell Wilson, who plays for the Broncos, thus making him part of the in-group. Therefore, both 'We' and 'russ' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to entities within the in-group team.	1664753524.0	broncos	raiders	Balakidy	Lord Elway	2.0	0.0022929906845090553	[5, 4]

The second sentence "Hate these type of games" continues this general sentiment without mentioning or implying either team, so it does not require specific tagging and remains tagged as [SENT]. The referring expression for the first sentence is not explicitly about any team, hence it gets the [OTHER] tag.	The comment "Flag on every play. Hate these type of games" does not explicitly reference any team or player, either from the in-group, out-group, or other group. The frustration about the gameplay being interrupted with too many penalties is a general observation and can be made irrespective of the teams playing. Since the first sentence doesn't clearly connect to either the in-group (Chargers) or the out-group (Seahawks) and it is a general observation applicable to any game, it is tagged as [OTHER]. The second sentence is a personal expression of frustration and, since it also does not specifically reference any team, it is left untagged as [SENT]. The overall frustration is not tied directly to a specific team but to the nature of the game itself.	1666557948.0	chargers	seahawks	Scrappydawg69		3.0	0.627868562936783	[5]

['[SENT]', 'This defense', 'this offense']	[(0, 6), (75, 87), (107, 119)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]', '[OUT]']	The context provided here tells us that the Seahawks (in-group) have a win probability of 0.0%, indicating they are losing badly. In the first sentence, 'the dam wouldnt have burst soon though' likely refers to the inevitability of the opponent's offensive success, implicitly suggesting that the out-group (49ers) were bound to overpower the in-group's defense. Hence, the first sentence should be tagged [OUT].In the second sentence, 'This defense' without further qualification means it refers to the in-group defense, i.e., the Seahawks' defense, which could not prevent the out-group from scoring. 'This offense' refers to the powerful offense of the out-group, the 49ers, which the Seahawks' defense could not hold back. Thus, 'This defense' is tagged [IN] and 'this offense' is tagged [OUT]. The '[SENT]' tag covers an implicit reference to the in-group since it's about the Seahawks' inability to hold back the opponent, matching the context of the overall dire win probability and game state.	The comment indicates a disparity between the capabilities of the defense and offense, suggesting a criticism of the in-group team's defense and acknowledgment of the out-group's offense prowess. In the first sentence, '[SENT]' is tagged as [OUT] since this idea, plus the lack of expressions explicitly aligned with the in-group, implies the author anticipates the strength of the out-group offense overwhelming. 'This defense' in the second sentence should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the Seahawks' defense, which the commenter believes is failing. 'This offense' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the strong 49ers' offense. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged [OUT], 'This defense' as [IN], and 'this offense' as [OUT].	1673741810.0	seahawks	49ers	Lime_Carpet		1.0	0.00010050283890494782	[5, 5, 5]

The use of "Y'all" indicates the commenter is addressing the team or its fanbase directly in a casual and colloquial manner, which is common among passionate fans. Since the in-group is the Chargers, "San Diego" should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability is relatively close, suggesting the game is somewhat competitive, but the commenter is focused on expressing nostalgia or dissatisfaction with the relocation of the team rather than current gameplay. Hence, "San Diego" refers to where the in-group team, the Chargers, previously played, justifying the [IN] tag.	The comment is referencing a past event where the in-group team, the Chargers, relocated from San Diego to Los Angeles. The phrase "Y'all should 've never left" implies a sense of longing or disappointment about this move, which is something a supporter of the in-group team might express. Therefore, "San Diego" should be tagged [IN] as it is associated with the in-group's historical home.	1633394268.0	chargers	raiders	silviodanteruntz		-10.0	0.595943093299866	[5]

'They' refers to the Falcons in this context, so it should be tagged as [OUT]. 'The Chargers' refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. The phrase "of the NFC" suggests that the Falcons are being compared to the Chargers based on performance or reputation. Therefore, 'the Chargers' should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability of 35.3% suggests that the in-group is not doing well, but this comment is more about a broader comparison than the immediate state of the game.	The commenter compares "they" to the Chargers, implying that "they" is another team perceived similarly to the Chargers but in the NFC (the out-group opponent), which signifies a lower regard. Therefore, "They" should be tagged as [OUT] since they are the out-group team, the Falcons. The phrase "the Chargers" is the in-group team the commenter supports and should be tagged [IN].	1667766034.0	chargers	falcons	Ne0guri	⚡️⬆️	5.0	0.353050112724304	[5, 5]

'RyAn' is likely referring to Ryan Fitzpatrick (a common nickname/stylization for the player), and 'Colt' is likely referencing Colt McCoy, both of whom are associated with the Commanders. Since the commenter appears to be addressing past negative remarks about these players, they should be tagged [IN] as they are part of the in-group team. Thus, 'RyAn' and 'Colt' are correctly tagged [IN].	The comment appears to be mocking critics of the in-group, implying they've gone silent because the in-group players (likely 'Ryan' and 'Colt', who are presumably Ryan Fitzpatrick and Colt McCoy) are performing well or have proved those critics wrong. Given this context, 'RyAn' and 'Colt' refer to in-group players and should therefore be tagged with [IN]. The reference to the people who criticized them ('folks') is directed at those who previously disparaged the in-group, further indicating these criticisms were directed at the in-group team.	1662925386.0	commanders	washington	outspoken_ringer		4.0	0.273652017116547	[5, 5]

This is a common way for fans to express concern or curiosity about their own team. Despite the high win probability, which suggests the 49ers are likely performing well, the commenter's focus on injury severity indicates a concern for their team's well-being. Hence, 'we' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the 49ers, the in-group team for the commenter.	'we' in this context usually refers to fans and supporters of a team. The commenter is likely expressing concern about an injury affecting their favorite team.

The comment "the hell was that?" expresses confusion or frustration, which suggests that it is in response to a specific play or event. Since the commenter is likely focused on the in-group (Packers) and is emotionally invested in their performance, this exclamation can be assumed to be about a surprising or disappointing action by the Packers. Because the sentence lacks explicit mention of a team or player but implicitly refers to the in-group team, the whole sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN].	The comment is expressing frustration or disbelief, which a fan typically directs towards their own team. There is no explicit reference to either team, but given the context of the game's frustration, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is upset about something the in-group team (Packers) did. Therefore, the entire sentence is tagged with [IN] implicitly, as it refers to the in-group team.	1632704852.0	packers	49ers	ShoddySalad		1.0	0.760627031326294	[5]

The mention of "Defense" and "Offense" without any qualifications or additional team identifiers strongly implies that the commenter is referring to the performance of the in-group team. Positive and negative comments about the performance such as "Defense plays well" and "Offense plays like shit" would typically refer to the team the commenter supports. Therefore, in this context, "Defense" and "Offense" should be tagged as [IN] throughout the comment since the commenter is discussing different aspects of the performance of their own team. Additionally, sentences without explicit reference but conveying sentiments about the game (e.g., "I hate it") are inherently about the in-group team, grounding the tags correctly as [IN].	The sequences of critique and praise in this comment suggest that the commenter is discussing various aspects of the in-group team (Raiders). The repeated switching between defense and offense, plus the expression of frustration at the end ("I hate it"), indicates that the commenter is disappointed with both units of their supported team at different times. Therefore, 'Defense' and 'Offense' in the first two sentences, 'Offense' and 'defense' in the third sentence, should be tagged with [IN] since they all refer to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	1670191903.0	raiders	chargers	nshave20		1.0	0.248020350933075	[5, 5, 5, 5]

The win probability is very low (3.8%), indicating that the in-group team (Bears) is struggling significantly. The statement "the other option is to just throw it away and also not get the first down" implies tactics that did not work, implicitly referring to the Bears' performance. Therefore, the entire first sentence is implicitly about the Bears, tagged [IN]. The phrase "Dude needs help" in the second sentence conveys that a player from the in-group team (Bears) is struggling and could use assistance, so "Dude" is tagged [IN] as well.	The first sentence implies a decision-making situation that the commenter is concerned about with respect to the in-group since they mention "the other option," potentially criticizing an in-group player's choice. In the second sentence, "Dude needs help" likely refers to an in-group player struggling and needing assistance, which fans usually express concern for towards their own team. Therefore, the first sentence tagged as [IN] denotes the concern for the in-group player. "Dude" in the second sentence should also be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group player needing help. "I" and "we" are not explicitly mentioned, but the context shows the commenter's implicit support for the in-group team.	1671393459.0	bears	eagles	broke-collegekid	Peanut Tillman	2.0	0.0381584167480469	[5, 5]

This critique could come from a supporter who is frustrated even in a winning scenario, as suggested by the high win probability for the in-group.The second sentence "KC special" is a sarcastic reference to the in-group team, Kansas City Chiefs, suggesting that such underperformance is typical for them. Because "KC" obviously refers to Kansas City, and Kansas City refers to the Chiefs in this context, "KC" should be tagged as [IN]. Thus, the overall sentiment expresses frustration with the in-group team, and the phrase "Playing down to the competition" implicitly criticizes the in-group without explicitly naming it. Therefore, "KC" is correctly tagged as [IN], reflecting the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The phrase "KC special" in the second sentence refers to the Kansas City Chiefs, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. The commenter is criticizing their own team for underperforming against the competition. Since "KC" is an abbreviation for Kansas City, it should be tagged as [IN]. In the first sentence, there is no explicit mention of a team, so it remains untagged.	1643580812.0	chiefs	bengals	MadzMartigan		4.0	0.805963829159737	[5]

Commenters frequently use 'we' to refer to the team they support, showing a sense of solidarity and identification with the team's performance. The desire to "score a lot of points" is a common aspiration for a supporter, especially given the relatively low win probability at the time, which suggests the in-group (Giants) might be trailing or not performing as well as desired. Thus, 'we' clearly refers to the in-group team, making 'Hope [IN] score a lot of points today' the correctly tagged output.	The word 'we' in the comment refers to the team that the commenter supports, which is the Giants. Fans typically use 'we' to refer to their own team, expressing their hope and support.

['Barkley', 'his', 'him']	[(7, 14), (103, 106), (130, 133)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	Saquon Barkley is a well-known player for the New York Giants, which is the in-group team in this scenario. The commenter is frustrated with Barkley's frequent injuries, indicating they are heavily invested in the player's performance—something typical of fans discussing their own team. The term 'snake bit' means he is seen as unlucky, being prone to injuries. The second sentence continues the sentiment without direct reference but is still about Barkley, reflecting a fan's frustration with a key player's unavailability. In the last sentence, the commenter suggests letting Barkley go when his contract ends, showing a disappointed but considered opinion about a player of their own team. Therefore, 'Barkley', 'his', and 'him' all refer to the in-group player Barkley and are correctly tagged with [IN].	The complaint about a recurring injury is about Barkley, who is a player for the in-group (Giants). The commenter is expressing frustration about a player from their own team, which they would not usually do for an out-group player. Therefore, 'Barkley' should be tagged with [IN]. In the second sentence, 'Hurt every year it's ridiculous' is implicitly referring to the same player, so no explicit tag is needed. In the third sentence, 'his contract' and 'him' both refer to Barkley as well, so each should be tagged [IN]. Thus, the tags [IN] for 'Barkley', 'his', and 'him' are correct in identifying that the commenter is focusing on an in-group player.	1633899535.0	giants	cowboys	Vlvthamr		5.0	0.15905660390853904	[5, 5, 5]

['We', 'we']	[(7, 9), (45, 47)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The win probability for the in-group Texans is extremely low at 0%, indicating they are almost certainly going to lose. This comment is expressing frustration about the poor performance of the in-group team, suggesting they are performing so badly it seems intentional. The use of "We" and "we" suggests a personal affiliation with the team, which is common when referring to the team one supports. Therefore, "We" and "we" should be tagged as [IN], as they are referring to the in-group team, the Texans.	The commenter uses 'We' and 'we', which typically refer to the in-group team they support. The sentiment expressed is negative ('just so bad', 'tanking'), which fans usually reserve for their own team rather than the opponent. Therefore, 'We' and 'we' should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to the in-group team, the Texans.	1634499916.0	texans	colts	PapiGoneGamer	:doodle17:	3.0	0.00017720460891701428	[5, 5]

Since Bosa plays for the 49ers, which is the in-group team, he should be tagged with [IN]. This aligns with the context where the win probability is relatively high, suggesting the in-group is doing well, and the commenter is enjoying the performance of their favorite team and celebrating its players. Therefore, 'bosa' should be tagged with [IN] in the comment.	Bosa refers to Nick Bosa, a player for the San Francisco 49ers, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. The commenter expresses affection for Bosa's signature celebration, indicating that the comment is from a fan. Thus, 'bosa' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	1670191170.0	49ers	dolphins	LiftedNoodow		12.0	0.723018765449524	[5]

The use of "we'd" almost universally refers to the team that the commenter supports, which in this case is the Texans. The context of needing to "win to even worry about it" suggests that the commenter is discussing the Texans' slim chances of success. Therefore, "we'd" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The use of "we'd" in the comment indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, which is the Texans (the in-group). The expression "we'd have to win" implies they are talking about the necessity of their team winning. Fans typically use "we" or "we'd" to refer to their in-group team. Thus '[IN]' correctly tags "we'd" as it refers to the in-group, the Texans.	1672602375.0	texans	jaguars	bdonvr	:ka:	2.0	0.0186726450920105	[5]

['Fuller']	[(37, 43)]	['[IN]']	The comment refers to Fuller, who is a player for the in-group team, the Broncos. The Broncos currently have a high win probability, suggesting they are performing well. Since the in-group team is positioned favorably, the comment likely discusses their players or their performance. The absence of derogatory language or context hinting at the opponent implies that the mention of "Fuller" is about an in-group player. Thus, "Fuller" should be tagged as [IN], as he refers to the player's in-group team, the Broncos.	The commenter mentions Fuller, who is a player on the Broncos, the in-group team. The comment indicates a play involving Fuller, and since Fuller is part of the in-group, it is appropriate to tag 'Fuller' with [IN]. The rest of the sentence doesn't explicitly mention any entities, so only 'Fuller' is tagged as such.	1638137000.0	broncos	chargers	dkinak23	TD Mile High Salute	1.0	0.729561507701874	[5]

The comment expresses pleasure at having Wentz back in the division in a way that is likely meant to be derogatory or sarcastic, implying that his presence is beneficial to the Cowboys (perhaps hinting at his perceived poor performance). Therefore, "Wentz" should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the out-group opponent team, which is Washington.	Carson Wentz is a player for the Washington team, which is the out-group opponent for the Cowboys. The comment indicates a positive sentiment towards Wentz being in the division, likely meaning they believe it will benefit their in-group team. This indicates that the commenter supports the Cowboys and views Wentz as an opponent, so 'Wentz' should be tagged as [OUT].	1664740543.0	cowboys	washington	J0llyR0dger	Dallas Cowboys	2.0	0.995978883933276	[5]

The comment expresses frustration about the performance of their own team, indicating that the commenter is referring to the Chiefs' behavior. The phrase "We need to be at least 10 points in the hole" is about the in-group's performance condition. The win probability being relatively low supports the sense of frustration or criticism from the in-group perspective. Therefore, both instances of 'we' should be tagged with [IN], referring to the in-group team, the Chiefs.	The commenter uses "We" and "we," which strongly suggests they are referring to the team they support, the Chiefs. The expression "10 points in the hole" indicates they feel their team needs to be behind by a significant margin before they start playing with more effort, a critique typically directed toward one's own team. Hence, '[IN]' correctly tags both instances of "We" and "we" as they refer to the in-group team, the Chiefs.	1666557508.0	chiefs	49ers	MoistWillingness	Patrick Mahomes II #15	4.0	0.436395525932312	[5, 5]

['Taylor']	[(7, 13)]	['[IN]']	With the in-group being the Patriots and a relatively high win probability indicating they are likely doing well, the commenter is likely referencing Jonathan Taylor, a player for the Patriots, in a positive or questioning manner. This fits the pattern of supporters focusing on their own team's performance or players when things are going in their favor. Therefore, 'Taylor' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to a member of the in-group team.	The comment seems to be questioning or inquiring about someone named "Taylor." Given the brevity and directness of the question, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is referring to a player on the team they support — the Patriots. Fans typically inquire about their own team's players more frequently, especially in the context of a live game. Thus, "Taylor" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team, the Patriots.	1636311328.0	patriots	panthers	RenterRenting		1.0	0.701634327339443	[5]

['my team', 'Lawrence']	[(94, 101), (244, 252)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter expresses strong emotions throughout, revealing a deep personal connection, indicative of their support for the in-group team, the Jaguars. The phrase "my team" clearly refers to the in-group, thus it is correctly tagged as [IN]. Additionally, "Lawrence" refers to Trevor Lawrence, the quarterback for the Jaguars, reinforcing that this is about the in-group team. Despite the high win probability, the emotional response suggests a fan who likely experiences the ups and downs of the game passionately, leading to expressions of both pride and frustration when discussing their team. The sentences without explicit references are tagged appropriately based on their context concerning the in-group team.	The commenter expresses frustration and embarrassment about their team, which is a sentiment typically directed toward an in-group team one supports. 'my team' is a direct reference to the in-group, the Jaguars, and is thus tagged with [IN]. In the last sentence, the commenter sarcastically mentions dealing with seeing 'what Lawrence can do,' where Lawrence refers to Trevor Lawrence, a player for the Jaguars (in-group). Hence, 'Lawrence' should be tagged as [IN].Thus, the entities 'my team' and 'Lawrence' are correctly tagged as in-group ([IN]) and correspond to the in-group the commenter supports (Jaguars).	1641761629.0	jaguars	colts	frighteous	:IND:	2.0	0.997900128394365	[5, 5]

The phrase "That was a perfect ball dude" is likely referring to a positive play from the in-group team, as fans often find something to appreciate even when their team is performing poorly overall. There is no explicit mention of the player or team, but contextually it seems to refer to a good pass (ball) completed by the Patriots. Hence, the whole sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment is referring to the in-group implicitly.	The comment likely refers to an in-group (Patriots) player making a great play. The expression "perfect ball" is generally used to compliment a pass, which supporters usually do for their own team's players. Since there is no explicit word or phrase that identifies the entity directly, the sentence as a whole should be tagged with [IN] to indicate the comment is about the in-group.	1671911365.0	patriots	bengals	FUtureThrowAWAYyy		0.0	0.0107211945578456	[5]

['this', 'them']	[(12, 16), (90, 94)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	The comment is from a Raiders fan during a game against the 49ers. 'this' in "this will atleast be a really high score" likely refers to the game itself, which involves both teams but is implicitly focused on the in-group's (Raiders') perspective. Thus, 'this' is tagged [IN]. The phrase "we are letting them score" implies that 'we' refers to the Raiders (in-group) and 'them' refers to the 49ers (out-group). Therefore, 'them' should be tagged [OUT]. The win probability is around 48.8%, indicating a close game, which fits well with the comment's context of both teams contributing to a high score.	The commenter uses "we" to refer to the in-group, the Raiders, and expresses frustration with the in-group's defense allowing the out-group to score quickly. Thus, "this" refers to the situation caused by the in-group, and "them" refers to the out-group, the 49ers. Therefore, "this" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group's actions, and "them" should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the opponent team.	1672614107.0	raiders	49ers	RaisingFargo	:Millen:	1.0	0.487926340690508	[5, 5]

Given that the win probability for the in-group (Eagles) is relatively low, it's likely that the commenter is focusing on a critical moment for their team. The lack of specific names or identifying qualifiers implies that the commenter assumes the reader knows they are talking about their own team's players. Therefore, "he" and "his" should be tagged with [IN] as they likely refer to an Eagles player. This interpretation aligns with a typical fan's perspective in a situation where a crucial play affected their team's chances.	The commenter is likely discussing a play involving an in-group player, as they show knowledge about the specific event and express a preference for the no-call decision, which suggests they didn't perceive an unfair advantage. Words like 'he' and 'his' in this context most likely refer to the in-group player who missed the pass, reflecting the commenter's focus on a player from the team they support (Eagles). Therefore, 'he' and 'his' should be tagged with [IN] since they are implicit references to the in-group player. The critical insight is that fans typically delve into such details primarily for their own team players.	1638133057.0	eagles	giants	TGR3326		3.0	0.28221496939659096	[5, 5]

Since the commenter is pointing out that JPP got held, it indicates their concern about something that happened to a member of their own team. Given the context, 'JPP' is clearly referring to an in-group player who faced a potentially unfair play, which aligns with fans being perceptive about moments that disadvantage their team, regardless of the relatively high win probability. Therefore, 'JPP' should be tagged [IN].	'JPP' refers to Jason Pierre-Paul, who is a player for the Buccaneers, the in-group team.

Given the high win probability of 91.7%, the commenter is likely feeling confident and excited about their team's performance. "PACK" is a common shorthand for Packers, and since it directly refers to the in-group team, it should be tagged as [IN].	The chant 'GO PACK GO' is a well-known cheer among Green Bay Packers fans. The use of 'PACK' is an abbreviation for 'Packers,' which directly refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.

'The Suicide Squad' is likely a sarcastic nickname used to describe their own team, highlighting a sense of frustration or resignation. There is no explicit mention of the in-group, out-group, or any other team, but the comment is implicitly about the in-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the sentiment conveyed indirectly relates to the in-group team.	Though there is no explicit mention of the in-group, out-group, or other teams in the comment, the context among fans sometimes involves making tangential comments that relate back to the in-group indirectly. The casual tone and lack of concern for the ongoing game suggest that the commenter might be a Commanders fan discussing something unrelated since they are disinterested at the moment, indicating a critique or resignation about their team's performance. Given this context, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' to denote that the commenter, by default, is speaking from the perspective of an in-group supporter.	1640569968.0	commanders	cowboys	Ye_Biz		1.0	0.04755089411018898	[5]

Despite the high win probability for the in-group (Patriots), the comment is focused on observing a specific equipment choice of Matt Ryan, displaying curiosity rather than criticism or support. Therefore, 'Matt Ryan' should be tagged with [OUT] as it refers to an out-group player. The second sentence lacks any specific reference to the in-group, out-group, or other NFL teams, so there is no need for additional tags.	Matt Ryan is the quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons, which is the out-group opponent in this context. Thus, 'Matt Ryan' should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to a player from the out-group team.

The use of "sucks" is a negative description directed at an opponent, in this case, Rodgers. Given the in-group is the 49ers and the out-group is the Packers, 'Rodgers' should be tagged as [OUT]. The comment overall reflects a fan's sentiment towards the opposing team's player, especially when the 49ers have a low win probability, which can sometimes incite more critical comments towards the opponents. Thus, the correct tag for 'Rodgers' is [OUT].	The commenter is asking for upvotes to express a negative opinion about Rodgers, who is a well-known player for the Packers, the out-group team. Therefore, 'Rodgers' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to a key member of the out-group.

Therefore, "PERINE" should be tagged [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	Samaje Perine is a player for the Bengals.

"DJ" refers to Daniel Jones, the Giants' quarterback, and "Saquon" refers to Saquon Barkley, the Giants' running back. "We" directly implies the in-group team, the Giants. Therefore, "DJ" and "Saquon" should be tagged with [IN] since they are key players on the in-group team, and "We" should also be tagged with [IN] as it signifies the commenter's support for and reference to the entire in-group team.	The players DJ (Daniel Jones) and Saquon (Saquon Barkley) are both prominent members of the Giants. The commenter is likely a Giants fan as they are expressing enthusiasm and support for these players. 'DJ' and 'Saquon' should therefore be tagged [IN] since they refer to the in-group players. Additionally, the use of 'We' typically denotes the team the commenter supports, expressing collective identity with the in-group.

Despite a low win probability, which suggests the Steelers are unlikely to win, the commenter is defending the in-group's defense, indicating that any fault lies elsewhere and not on the defense.In American football, "D" often stands for defense. Given that "the D" is said without specifying a team, it likely refers to the commenter's own team defense, which would be the Steelers in this case. The phrase "has gotten them the ball all this half" suggests that "them" and later in "it won't be on them" both refer to other parts or members of the in-group team. The phrase implies that the defense has provided opportunities, so any failures are not the defense's fault ("it won't be on them").Thus, "the D" refers to the Steelers' defense, and "them" in two instances refers to the Steelers as well, hence they should all be tagged as [IN].The phrase "the D" refers to the in-group team's defense (Steelers), particularly due to the conversation being about the defense's performance this half. The term "them	The commenter is discussing the performance of the defense ('the D'), which is commonly used to refer to a team's defense without qualification. This implies the in-group's defense.

Therefore, 'the D' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group's defense, and both instances of 'them' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the in-group team as well.	1666580337.0	steelers	dolphins	russbii		1.0	0.16334341466426805	[5, 5, 5]

['Bills', 'Vikings', 'Cardinals']	[(127, 132), (135, 142), (177, 186)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]', '[IN]']	The commenter is discussing their enjoyment of the ongoing Bills vs. Vikings game and anticipates watching the Cardinals game next. Since the Bills and Vikings are not the in-group (Cardinals) or out-group (Rams) for the commenter, these teams should be tagged as [OTHER]. The Cardinals, the in-group team, are mentioned specifically, so they are tagged as [IN]. The comment overall does not mention the Rams explicitly, so there is no tagging needed for [OUT].	The first two sentences do not reference any specific teams and are general comments about the enjoyment of the game, so they don't need tagging. In the third sentence, the commenter mentions the "Bills / Vikings game" which are neither the in-group nor the out-group; hence, these should be tagged as [OTHER]. Finally, "Cardinals" is the team the commenter supports, thus it should be tagged as [IN].	1668375714.0	cardinals	rams	CoachWilksRide	:wolf: Wolf	6.0	0.395660638809204	[5, 5, 5]

This is indicative of the commenter attributing suspicious bias from the referees towards the out-group team, suggesting that the referees are making calls in favor of the Eagles (the out-group).   "The ref Union" is considered neutral and doesn't belong to either the in-group or out-group teams, as referees are an independent entity in the NFL. Therefore, it is tagged as [OTHER].- "The Eagles" are explicitly mentioned as the out-group in this comment, hence it is tagged as [OUT].The win probability for the in-group team (49ers) being relatively low (26.3%) reinforces the sentiment of frustration or conspiracy against the in-group, which is why the out-group (Eagles) is viewed negatively in this context.Thus, the tags accurately reflect the nature of the entities mentioned in the comment.	The comment expresses frustration or suspicion about the referees being biased towards the Eagles. The phrase 'ref Union' refers to the group of referees officiating the game, which is neither the in-group (49ers) nor the out-group (Eagles); hence, it should be labeled as [OTHER]. 'The Eagles' clearly refers to the out-group team, so it is correctly tagged as '[OUT]'.	1675027848.0	49ers	eagles	cassatta	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	1.0	0.26347026597700296	[5, 5]

The commenter is expressing a sentiment of nostalgia, missing a previous key player from the team they support, which would only make sense if they were talking about their own team in a struggling state, as indicated by the very low win probability. Therefore, "B Marsh" should be tagged with [IN], denoting the in-group team the commenter supports.	'B Marsh' likely refers to Brandon Marshall, a former wide receiver for the Jets. The commenter is expressing a nostalgic fondness, which is more typical for a player from the in-group team.

The high win probability suggests that the commenter's team, the Seahawks, are performing well, and in this instance, it could simply be a case of the commenter expressing a general disdain for the Vikings who are performing poorly or are disliked. Therefore, 'Vikings' is correctly tagged as [OTHER] since it is referring to a team that is not involved in the current game.	The comment 'Vikings fuckin stink' is not directly about either the in-group team (Seahawks) or the out-group opponent (Jets). The 'Vikings' refers to another team in the NFL that is neither the in-group nor the out-group.

'Shaq' refers to Shaquil Barrett, a player for the Buccaneers, so it should be tagged [IN] since he is part of the in-group. The first sentence about the "offsides" penalty doesn't directly mention any team or player, and seems to discuss general bad officiating, hence it is tagged [OTHER]. The third sentence uses 'they,' which in this context questions the referees/officials, so it is also tagged [OTHER]. The fourth sentence likewise comments on the officiating (ruling that a fumble is an incomplete pass), which is a general complaint about the officials, thus [OTHER]. The sentences "but whatever, we're in good shape going into the half" and "Let's finish this!" both imply support for the in-group, hence they are tagged [IN] since they refer to the in-group's current and future state. 'we' also refers to the in-group team, the Buccaneers, expressing confidence in their performance.	The commenter is a supporter of the Buccaneers and the game is against the Falcons. 1. The first sentence "[SENT] That 'offsides' penalty was just bad." does not specifically mention any entities, so it is tagged as [OTHER], implying the comment is about the referees or a general observation.2.

'49s' refers explicitly to the 49ers, who are the out-group in this context. The high win probability for the Packers suggests they are doing well, but the comment focuses on the annoying behavior of the commentators rather than the performance of the in-group team. The use of 'they' in the second sentence refers to the commentators, who are not directly related to either team in a way that affects the in-group/out-group dynamic in this context and thus are not tagged. Hence, '49s' should be correctly tagged [OUT]. There are no other specific entities mentioned that merit tagging. '49s' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the out-group team, the 49ers, about whom the commentary is being made. The remaining parts of the sentences are not referring to specific entities that can be classified as in-group, out-group, or other, hence they are not tagged.	The commenter is expressing frustration about the commentators discussing the opposing team, the 49ers, which indicates the commenter supports the Packers (in-group) and finds the emphasis on the out-group team annoying. The term "49s" refers to the opposing team and should be tagged as [OUT]. The rest of the sentence does not contain explicit mentions of the in-group or out-group, but the frustration is clearly about the out-group coverage, which is why the rest of the sentence is not tagged.	1642904962.0	packers	49ers	BigMACfive	:AronJone:	3.0	0.678379625082016	[5]

[IN] very dumb play man 	['Huntley', '[SENT]']	[(47, 54), (57, 63)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The win probability for the in-group team, the Ravens, is very low at 8.5%, which suggests they are currently in a tough spot or losing the game. In the first sentence, 'Huntley' is a reference to a player on the Ravens team. Since the commenter identifies the in-group as the Ravens, 'Huntley' should be tagged with [IN]. This indicates that Huntley's play could dramatically impact the season negatively for the in-group team, reflecting the desperation or frustration of the fan.In the second sentence, the commenter expresses frustration or disappointment with the play mentioned in the first sentence. There is no explicit reference to an entity here, but given the context, it's clear that the frustration is directed towards the in-group team's play, specifically referring back to Huntley's action. Therefore, the [SENT] token in this sentence should be tagged with [IN] to reflect that the commenter is still discussing the in-group.Thus, the phrases 'Huntley' and the implicit reference in '[SENT]' are correctly tagged as [IN] (referring to the Ravens or their player). This maintains coherence with the overall context of the commenter's disappointment with their in-group team.	Huntley is a player for the Ravens, the in-group team. The negative sentiment toward the play suggests the commenter is critical of their own team. The second sentence carries the criticism forward but doesn't mention an explicit subject. Therefore, 'Huntley' should be tagged [IN] and the second sentence '[SENT]' should also be tagged [IN] as it implicitly refers to the in-group player's actions.	1673840792.0	ravens	bengals	EatCleanTrainHard		5.0	0.084564208984375	[5, 5]

['their']	[(21, 26)]	['[OUT]']	The comment refers to being "bailed out" by the opponent's lack of discipline, which suggests that the commenter is expressing relief over a fortunate situation caused by the in-group's opponent, the Lions, making mistakes. The phrase "their lack of discipline" logically refers to the Lions (out-group), as the commenter would be grateful for the opponent's errors benefiting their supported team (in-group). The win probability of 43.0% indicates a relatively even game, so pointing out the opponent's detrimental mistakes is plausible. Thus, the word "their" should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the out-group.	The phrase "their lack of discipline" is referring to the opponent team, as the commenter is happy about being "bailed out" by this lack of discipline. Fans typically take pleasure in their opponents making mistakes, which indicates that "their" is referring to the out-group team, the Lions. Therefore, "their" should be tagged with [OUT]. The commenter's satisfaction is a clear indication they are referring to their rivals' fault, and not their own, thereby correctly tagging the expressions as aligned with the out-group.	1667151300.0	dolphins	lions	Xelltrix		3.0	0.4295903606122	[5]

The exclamation of "OT" (overtime) and "holy fuck lol" indicates a mix of astonishment and disbelief. Bailey Zappe is a player for the Patriots, which is the in-group team. The low win probability of 32.5% suggests that the in-group (Patriots) are not favored to win, and the OT situation can be seen as surprising or frustrating to the commenter. Thus, 'Zappe' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team, and the rest of the sentence, while implicitly referring to the in-group by using 'We,' does not need explicit tagging besides the mention of Zappe.Overall, "Zappe" rightfully belongs to the in-group team the commenter supports. There were no other specific entities mentioned that required tagging.	The comment expresses surprise or disbelief about going into overtime, and mentions 'Zappe'. Since Zappe is a player for the Patriots, the in-group team the commenter supports, 'Zappe' should be tagged with [IN]. 'We' at the beginning of the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team, supporting the interpretation that 'Zappe' is also part of the in-group. Thus '[IN]' correctly tags 'Zappe' and it is the appropriate label for this context.	1664753196.0	patriots	packers	iAmTheRealLange		14.0	0.325035035610199	[5]

['JJ']	[(12, 14)]	['[IN]']	'JJ' here most likely refers to Justin Jefferson, a well-known player for the Vikings, who is the in-group team the commenter supports. The use of 'Held' suggests that a player in the in-group is being impeded unfairly, which is something fans would typically complain about when it happens to their own players. The win probability is slightly above 50%, so the game is somewhat close, adding to the frustration of perceived unfair play. Therefore, 'JJ' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. The second sentence 'That jersey tug!' likely emphasizes the previous complaint without introducing new entities, hence it does not need any additional entity tagging.	'JJ' refers to Justin Jefferson, a prominent player for the Vikings (in-group). The exclamation "Held JJ again!" suggests frustration over Jefferson being held, which fans would be upset about if it happened to their own player. This indicates that the comment is about the in-group's player being unfairly treated, and thus 'JJ' should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence does not contain any explicit referring expression but is contextually related to the first sentence, emphasizing the same in-group situation regarding the 'jersey tug'. Therefore, the tag for the second sentence remains as is since it continues the implicit reference.	1668373525.0	vikings	bills	Pyschic_Psycho	84	2.0	0.544145405292511	[5]

The commenter expresses positive sentiment about Simmons' performance ("Love Simmons rushing the QB"), which is an indication of their support for the in-group player. Therefore, "Simmons" is tagged as [IN], reflecting the in-group association. The win probability being 38.0% indicates that the in-group is currently trailing, but the comment's focus is on an individual positive action by an in-group player rather than the overall game situation.	The commenter expresses appreciation for Simmons' performance by saying "Love Simmons rushing the QB." Since Simmons is a player for the Cardinals, and the commenter supports the Cardinals (making the Cardinals the in-group), 'Simmons' should be tagged as [IN]. The overall sentiment indicates support for the in-group with no mention of the out-group, reinforcing that the sentence is centered around the in-group team's actions and players.	1667158698.0	cardinals	vikings	pushing-rope	:old: Cardinals Throwback	3.0	0.380475074052811	[5]

The commenter is discussing the decision-making and play-calling responsibilities within the Bengals team. Even though specific names are used to refer to individuals, these individuals are part of the in-group team, so they should be tagged as [IN]. The repeated references to 'Joe' are referring to Joe Burrow, the Bengals quarterback, and 'he' and 'his' refer back to Zac Taylor. Given that the win probability is low, it indicates the in-group might not be performing well, potentially explaining why the commenter is scrutinizing play-calling decisions. Therefore, 'Zac,' 'Joe,' 'Joe,' 'he,' 'his,' and 'he' all refer to individuals within the Bengals team and should be tagged [IN], aligning with the in-group identification.	The comment appears to be discussing the Bengals' coaching and quarterback play. 'Zac' is likely Zac Taylor, the head coach of the Bengals, who would be in charge of calling plays. 'Joe' refers to Joe Burrow, the Bengals' quarterback, who receives and executes these checks and instructions from Zac. The commenter is providing a detailed explanation of the play-calling dynamics within the Bengals, so both 'Zac' and 'Joe' should be tagged [IN] as they are associated with the in-group team. The pronoun 'he' and the possessive 'his' also refer back to Zac Taylor, reiterating his role and authority, and should likewise be tagged [IN]. The commenter is focused exclusively on the in-group team's players and their specific roles, which justifies the tags throughout the comment.	1638733865.0	bengals	chargers	Celtictussle		1.0	0.215121820569038	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

The win probability for the Vikings is relatively low at 31%, indicating they may not be playing well. It is common for fans to criticize their own team's decisions, especially when the team is losing or not performing as expected. Although the comment doesn't explicitly mention the Vikings, it is reasonable to infer that the frustration is directed towards them, given the complaint about the playcall. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]', as it implicitly refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The comment is expressing frustration with a play call, which is a criticism likely directed towards the team the commenter supports. Since the commenter is a Vikings fan, this criticism is implicitly about the Vikings' playcalling. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN] even though there are no explicit words or phrases that refer directly to the Vikings. The tag '[SENT]' effectively captures the critique directed at the in-group team's playcall.	1633287064.0	vikings	browns	1002003004005006007	THIS IS NOT DETROIT MAN THIS IS THE SUPERBOWL	2.0	0.309620499610901	[5]

Given that the commenter supports the Ravens and Jackson is one of their key players, the nickname "Action Jackson" is an in-group reference expressing excitement or admiration for Jackson's performance. The exclamation marks emphasize the enthusiasm, which aligns with the high win probability indicating that the team is doing well. Therefore, "Action Jackson" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a key player from the in-group team the commenter supports.	"Action Jackson" is a nickname for Lamar Jackson, who is the quarterback for the Ravens. Since the in-group team is the Ravens, and the comment is expressing excitement, it is targeted towards the in-group player. Therefore, "Action Jackson" should be tagged with [IN].

Since Chicago is neither the in-group nor the out-group, it should be tagged as [OTHER]. The use of "we" in the first sentence implies the in-group team (Steelers), but since there is no explicit mention of the in-group team within the sentences provided, we have no directly tagged reference for the in-group in this specific instance. Thus, the only tagged reference expression is 'Chicago', and it should be labeled as [OTHER]. The win probability of 25.3% indicates that the in-group is likely not performing well, which could be why rankings are being discussed in a context that doesn't explicitly mention the in-group team.	The commenter is speaking about team rankings. Since the game is between the Steelers and the Jets, and the comment mentions 'Chicago', it indicates a team other than the in-group (Steelers) or out-group (Jets). Thus, 'Chicago' refers to another team within the NFL. The word 'we' is used for the in-group, and since the in-group didn't mention an explicit team in the second sentence, there's no specific tag for that, making 'Chicago' the only tag necessary.	1664732630.0	steelers	jets	triantie		1.0	0.253306250486247	[5]

This pronoun usage is a common way for fans to refer to their own team, implying a shared identity and frustration with the team's strategy. The low win probability (10.9%) indicates the Bears are performing poorly at the moment, which aligns with the commenter's criticism of their blitzing strategy. Thus, "we" should be tagged as [IN]. There is no need to tag other parts of the sentence as referring to different groups because "we" clearly refers to the in-group, and the entire comment is implicitly focused on the in-group's actions.	The word 'we' in the comment typically refers to the team that the commenter supports. Since the commenter supports the Bears, 'we' refers to the in-group team, the Bears. Thus, 'we' should be tagged as [IN]. The comment expresses frustration about a lack of blitzing, which is an action related to the team's defensive strategy, something a fan would typically discuss about their own team. Hence, '[SENT]' is tagged correctly with '[IN]' since there are no explicit words/phrases referring to the in-group or out-group other than the implicit reference to the in-group team (Bears).	1667764985.0	bears	dolphins	Penetraytion	Smokin' Jay	4.0	0.109118105417954	[5]

Jeff Ulbrich is the defensive coordinator for the Jets, the in-group team. Given the extremely low win probability for the Jets, it is clear why the commenter is frustrated. Therefore, the term 'Ulbrich' should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to a member of the in-group team.	The commenter is criticizing the play calls, calling them a "trash fire" and then directly mentioning "Ulbrich," who is Jeff Ulbrich, the defensive coordinator for the Jets. Since Ulbrich is a coach for the in-group team (the Jets), the word "Ulbrich" should be tagged with [IN]. The critique implies dissatisfaction with the in-group's performance, reinforcing the in-group association. Thus '[IN]' is the correct label for 'Ulbrich'.	1664132666.0	jets	bengals	NYJetLegendEdReed	:nj20:	6.0	0.026756768295676	[5]

They are neither part of the in-group team the commenter supports (Bears) nor the out-group opponent team (Texans). Neutral entities such as referees or officials are categorized under the tag [OTHER] because they do not belong to either the in-group or the out-group. Hence, the word "Refs" should be tagged as [OTHER].	In the context of an NFL game between the Bears and the Texans, 'Refs' is neither associated with the in-group (Bears) nor the out-group (Texans), but rather a general entity in the game that oversees it. Referees (or 'Refs') are a neutral party and do not belong to either team. Therefore, 'Refs' should be tagged as [OTHER] since they do not belong to either the in-group or the out-group.	1664134402.0	bears	texans	Sks44	Blowup	1.0	0.643944203853607	[5]

The statement implies frustration that the Patriots don't have a good punter, which is a complaint a fan would make about their own team. Despite the win probability being relatively low, the focus is still on the in-group's specific shortcomings, reinforcing that "Pats" should be tagged [IN]. Thus, "Pats" correctly refers to the in-group, and no other team or entity is mentioned or implied in this context.	The term 'Pats' is a common shorthand for the Patriots, the team the commenter supports, making it the in-group. The entire comment is about the Patriots' situation with their punter, which aligns with the in-group context. Therefore, 'Pats' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team.	1669340938.0	patriots	vikings	PretendCasual		4.0	0.44079494476318404	[5]

Given the high win probability of 83.7%, it suggests that the team is performing well, which could be why the commenter is so enthusiastic about Carr's performance. They predict an MVP season for him, showing strong support and confidence in their team's quarterback. Thus, 'CARR' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team.	The commenter is expressing their confidence in Carr's upcoming season and since Carr is the quarterback for the Raiders, the in-group team, 'CARR' should be tagged with [IN]. This indicates the commenter is referencing an in-group player in a positive light, thus the sentence is implicitly about the in-group.	1632080408.0	raiders	steelers	gideh		9.0	0.836622064920659	[5]

The commenter is excited and cheering on Devin McCourty with the abbreviation "LFG" (Let's F***ing Go), which is a commonly used expression of enthusiasm and support. Given the high win probability, the Patriots are probably doing well at this moment. Consequently, "D-Mac" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player on the in-group team the commenter supports.	'D-Mac' is a nickname for Devin McCourty, a player for the Patriots, which is the in-group team.

Given this context, the commenter appears to be frustrated with the in-group team's performance. Here's the breakdown:1. "chargers" is referring to the out-group team that is blitzing, so it should be tagged [OUT].2. "we" refers to the in-group team (Eagles) the commenter supports, indicating frustration with their lack of blocking, so it should be tagged [IN].3. "hurts" refers to Jalen Hurts, who is a player for the Eagles (in-group), therefore it should be tagged [IN].Overall, the commenter expresses frustration over the in-group team's failure to block the blitz, leading to the out-group's tactical advantage.

Hence, 'Glennon' is tagged [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team. The rest of the sentence is simply a description of Glennon's actions and does not refer to any specific entity directly, so no additional tags are necessary.	The comment features a disparaging remark about Glennon, who is Mike Glennon, a player for the Giants (the in-group team the commenter supports). Fans often make sarcastic or critical comments about their own players, especially when they are frustrated or disappointed.

The Bears' win probability is almost evenly split but slightly below 50%, suggesting the game is still competitive. By stating "Fields already has 100", the commenter is noting an impressive performance by an in-group player early in the game. 'Fields' is tagged [IN] since he is a member of the in-group (Bears). The second sentence "Unreal" expresses amazement at this performance but does not contain an explicit referring expression, so it is not tagged. Thus, 'Fields' is correctly tagged with [IN].	The commenter mentions "Fields," which refers to Justin Fields, the quarterback for the Chicago Bears, indicating a positive performance by noting his 100 yards early in the game. Since the in-group team the commenter supports is the Bears, "Fields" should be tagged with [IN].

Since the commenter supports the 49ers and the opponent team is the Broncos, 'Russell Wilson' should be tagged as [OUT] since he is a player for the out-group. While Cris Collinsworth is mentioned, he does not belong to either the in-group or out-group; he is a former player and current media personality, unassociated with the current teams playing, and should thus be tagged as [OTHER]. The phrase 'I do n't pay attention to what players and media personalities do outside of the game' establishes context but doesn't refer to the in-group, out-group, or another team specifically, ensuring that referring expressions are correctly identified and tagged based on their specific references within the comment.	The comment mentions two individuals, Russell Wilson and Cris Collinsworth. Russell Wilson is a known player for the Denver Broncos, who are the out-group team in this context. Therefore, he is tagged as [OUT]. Cris Collinsworth is a media personality and former player, but he is not directly associated with the ongoing game between the 49ers and Broncos, nor is he a part of either in-group or out-group; he is considered an external entity.

The comment "Literally no one came to play" is a direct critique of the team's overall performance, implying that none of the players are performing well. Since in such contexts, it is common for fans to criticize their own team when they are doing poorly, the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group team. There are no explicit references to either the in-group or out-group, so the entire sentence is tagged as [IN] to reflect the implicit criticism of the Falcons.	The comment expresses disappointment, implying that the team the commenter supports (the in-group) is underperforming.

Thus, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN] even without a specific noun or phrase directly referring to the team. The complaint about effort or performance is implicitly directed at the Falcons, and '[SENT]' should be tagged '[IN]' since there is no explicit word/phrase that refers to the in-group, but the comment is referring to the in-group implicitly.	1636917187.0	falcons	cowboys	cayuts21		5.0	0.010082304477691983	[5]

'Schlottman' should be tagged [IN] since the frustration indicates the player is on the in-group. 'this team' also refers to the Broncos, hence it should also be tagged with [IN].

"This guy" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to an in-group player who has been underperforming or absent in a notable way.	The phrase 'this guy' likely refers to a player whose performance has noticeably improved or had a sudden impact.

The win probability is low for the Lions, suggesting they are struggling and it could be plausible they are concerned about their own players, but without a specific reference, this remains ambiguous. Given this ambiguity, "he" is most reasonably tagged as [OTHER], indicating that the commenter might be referring to a player from another NFL team who is not directly involved in the ongoing game. Therefore, "he" should be tagged with [OTHER] since there's insufficient context to clearly identify "he" as part of either the in-group or the out-group.	The comment uses 'he' without specifying which player it is referring to. Given the lack of context about whether 'he' is a player from the in-group (Lions), the out-group (Packers), or some other team in the NFL, it is tagged as [OTHER]. This is a cautious approach as there is insufficient information to definitively associate 'he' with either the in-group or out-group, suggesting that this could be about a player from an entirely different team.	1632190558.0	lions	packers	talltime	I wanna die	1.0	0.10766524076461803	[5]

The low win probability of 3.0% indicates that the Seahawks are losing significantly at this point, which aligns with the context of mentioning a negative event (a fumble) associated with an in-group player. Therefore, "the G*no fumble" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an event involving an in-group player.	The comment refers to Geno Smith, the quarterback for the Seahawks, by mentioning "the G*no fumble." The commenter implies that the frequency of the fumble being shown is significant. Given the context, this suggests the fumble incident is notorious among Seahawks fans and critique or attention given to it would be most relevant to the in-group.

In the second sentence, the expletive 'he' is used derogatorily, implying negative sentiment towards a player. Given that the in-group Steelers have a low win probability and the rest of the comment does not indicate that the criticism is self-directed, it's inferred that this refers to an opposing player, making 'he' an out-group reference. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged [OUT].	The second sentence contains a derogatory remark about a player referred to as "he," which suggests the commenter is frustrated with the actions of an out-group player. Fans typically do not use such harsh critique for their in-group players, especially without context of poor in-group performance. Thus '[he]' should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to an out-group player.

Given that the win probability is 100%, the Cowboys (in-group) are dominating the game, which aligns with the positive tone of the comment. Thus, 'Dante' should be tagged [IN] as he is likely a Cowboys player. There are no explicit mentions of out-group players or other teams, hence no other tags are necessary.	The commenter is discussing a player named Dante, noting that he has generally performed well. There is no indication that Dante belongs to the out-group (Bears), and criticism of a minor mistake with some defensiveness ("weren't allowed to see") suggests a closer affiliation, indicating he is part of the in-group (Cowboys). Thus, 'Dante' should be tagged as [IN] since he is referred to by the commenter in a way that implies support and association with the in-group team, the Cowboys.	1667160286.0	cowboys	bears			6.0	0.999917871915386	[5]

The focus is on a positive aspect of the player's skills, despite the very low win probability suggesting that the team is not performing well overall. Using Ridder's last name without additional context implies familiarity and support, which is common among fans discussing their own players. Therefore, 'ridder' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	'Ridder' refers to Desmond Ridder, who is a quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons. Since the commenter supports the Falcons, any reference to Ridder should be tagged as [IN]. The sentence talks about where Ridder, an in-group player, excels ('Play action is clearly where'), thus making 'ridder' the correct referring expression to be tagged as [IN].	1671909441.0	falcons	ravens	csandrew98		7.0	0.05660559237003304	[5]

[IN] 're about to be tied with the [OTHER] here ..... it's bad 	['we', 'Jets']	[(56, 58), (89, 93)]	['[IN]', '[OTHER]']	The comment is expressing a sentiment about the state of the game, specifically the potential for the in-group team (Patriots) to get a top 10 draft pick, but also lamenting that they are about to be tied with another team, the Jets.Given the context:- The phrase "I mean I like the idea of a top 10 pick but ...." does not clearly indicate the in-group, out-group, or other, so no tagging is needed here.- The word "we" refers to the in-group team (Patriots). This is a common usage where fans refer to their team as "we." The commenter is expressing concern about their team's current performance.- The phrase "about to be tied with the Jets here" refers to the Jets, which are neither the in-group team (Patriots) nor the out-group (Buccaneers). Therefore, "Jets" should be tagged as [OTHER].Thus, the correct tagging should be "we" as [IN] since it refers to the Patriots, and "Jets" as [OTHER] since it refers to another team that is not currently playing against the Patriots. The low win probability indicates that the commenter expects their team to struggle, which aligns with the context provided	The commenter is expressing dissatisfaction with their team (Patriots) potentially being tied with the Jets. 'we' refers to the in-group team (Patriots) since the commenter uses it in a self-referential manner. 'Jets' is a team that is not involved in the specific game between the Patriots and the Buccaneers, thus tagged as [OTHER]. The word 'we' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, and 'Jets' is correctly tagged [OTHER] since it refers to an unrelated team.	1633315332.0	patriots	buccaneers	pup5581		1.0	0.16673960906808	[5, 5]

Despite the win probability being relatively low, the commenter is focusing on the strengths of their own team. 1. "the offense" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the offensive unit of the Dolphins.2. "the players" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the players forming part of the Dolphins team.3. "McDaniel" should be tagged [IN] because Mike McDaniel is the head coach of the Dolphins.Thus, the referred expressions are correctly tagged as per their affiliation with the in-group team (Dolphins).	The comment is praising the design of the offense and a specific coach, McDaniel, which strongly suggests the commenter is talking about their own team, the Dolphins. 'the offense' and 'the players' refer to the in-group team as the commenter is complimenting how the offense is designed to suit the players' strengths. 'McDaniel' is Mike McDaniel, the head coach of the Dolphins, and thus should also be tagged as [IN].	1663520961.0	dolphins	ravens			11.0	0.301195472478867	[5, 5, 5]

The use of "we" in the first sentence refers to the in-group, indicating it is about the Ravens. In the second sentence, "we" again refers to the Ravens, and "Tucker" is a renowned kicker for the Ravens. The final sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group, as the commenter is expressing satisfaction with the Ravens' performance. Given that these expressions and sentences are clearly referring to the in-group team without mentioning the out-group, they should all be tagged as [IN]. 'we' should be tagged [IN] in both instances since it refers to the in-group team, 'Tucker' should be tagged [IN] because he is a player for the Ravens, and the final sentence should be tagged [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group team.	The comment is expressing surprise and pride in the performance of the in-group team, the Ravens, since the commenter is reflecting positively on their performance despite not needing standout plays from a key player, Justin Tucker, who is a well-known kicker for the Ravens. Here's a detailed breakdown:1. "how many of you thought **we**'re going to be 14 - 14" - The "we" here refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, which is the Ravens. 2. "And **we** did n't even need godtier 50+yd **Tucker**'s kicks" - This sentence refers again to the in-group, emphasizing that the Ravens didn't even need the extraordinary skills of their star kicker, Justin Tucker, to perform well. Both "we" and "Tucker" should be tagged [IN].3. "This is absolutely better than expected" - This phrase, though it does not explicitly mention the Ravens, implies satisfaction with the performance of the in-group team and hence the entire sentence should be tagged [IN].Therefore, the tags and the referring expressions are correct as they accurately reflect that the commenter is speaking positively about the in-group team, the Ravens.	1639953298.0	ravens	packers	rasputinas	 :PBIRD:	13.0	0.270728945732117	[5, 5, 5, 5]

Therefore, "Watkins" who made the catch, "Hurts" who threw the interception, and "Smith" who hasn't been targeted are all related to the in-group. Hence, they should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to players from the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter is discussing players who play for the in-group team, the Eagles. 'Watkins' made a catch, 'Hurts' threw an interception, and 'Smith' hasn't been targeted—all these players are members of the in-group team.

The comment reflects a strong negative sentiment towards the team's performance, suggesting that continuous reliance on such a disappointing team would lead to despair. 'this team' refers to the Cowboys, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'this team' should be tagged [IN] because the comment is about the team the commenter identifies with and follows. The entire statement disparages the in-group team due to its ongoing poor performance.	The commenter is making a disparaging remark about the team they support, indicative of frustration or disappointment, which fans often express towards their own team. Thus, 'this team' refers to the in-group since the comment expresses an emotional connection typically associated with the team the commenter supports.

The second sentence mentions "Refs," which typically refers to referees or officials and is not directly related to either team playing the game. Therefore, "Refs" should be tagged with [OTHER]. This is based on the fact that referees are neutral parties and not part of any specific team, making them an "other" entity. While the win probability shows the Browns are currently losing, the focus of the comment is on the overall difficulty of watching the game and the perceived dominance of the referees, rather than either team's performance directly.	The commenter expresses affection for the in-group team, the Browns, in the first sentence. The use of "I love the Browns" clearly refers to the in-group team. Therefore, 'the Browns' is tagged as [IN].In the second sentence, the commenter says, "Refs have taken over." This is a common phrase used in sports to suggest that the referees are excessively influencing the outcome of the game. It's a way to blame poor officiating, but since referees are neutral parties and not affiliated with any team, "Refs" is tagged as [OTHER].Thus, 'the Browns' is tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group, and 'Refs' is tagged [OTHER] because it refers to neutral referees.	1670785221.0	browns	bengals			4.0	0.298673391342163	[5, 5]

['we', '[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(15, 17), (78, 84), (120, 126)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment reflects frustration and disappointment from the perspective of a 49ers fan, given the extremely low win probability indicating they are almost certain to lose. The first sentence explicitly uses 'we', which indicates the in-group team, the 49ers. The second and third sentences continue the sentiment without direct reference to specific entities, but they are still centered around the in-group team's situation. Therefore, the '[SENT]' tokens in the second and third sentences are tagged as [IN] to represent the context of the in-group. The expressions "we" should be tagged [IN] as it directly refers to the commenters' supported team, the 49ers. The two implicit references in the subsequent sentences are tagged as [IN] because they continue the discussion related to the in-group's plight.	The commenter uses 'we' to refer to the in-group team, which is the 49ers, indicating that they are the frustrated fan of this team. In the first sentence, 'we' clearly shows that the commenter is talking about the in-group team's struggle due to their QB getting hurt. The second and third sentences continue this narrative of frustration regarding the loss and unfortunate circumstances surrounding their team. Although there are no specific words or phrases that explicitly mention the in-group team in the second and third sentences, the context is still about the in-group team, which the commenter supports. Therefore, these sentences are tagged as [IN] because the overall narrative pertains to the plight of the 49ers.The first sentence's use of 'we' indicates a reference to the in-group, the 49ers. The second and third sentences, although lacking explicit terms for either team, continue in the context of discussing the in-group's unfortunate situation.

The use of "we" indicates the commenter's identification with the in-group (Raiders), as fans often use "we" to refer to their own team. Therefore, "we" should be tagged as [IN] because it represents the in-group that the commenter supports.	The phrase 'we' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, which is the Raiders. The sentiment implies that the commenter is resigned to the Raiders losing another lead. Thus, 'we' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	1671405399.0	raiders	patriots	TheDonGilly	:Undercarr:	0.0	0.750664964318276	[5]

The use of "him" follows shortly after a mention of the defense, and contextually, it refers to an opponent player who made a play (getting to the first down), thereby implicating the out-group, the Chargers. Despite the Falcons having a higher win probability, the comment focuses on a specific play where the defense allowed an opponent to reach a first down. Hence, "our defense" should be tagged [IN] for the in-group team, and "him" should be tagged [OUT] for the out-group opponent team.	The commenter starts by expressing approval of their own team's defense, which is the Falcons, indicated by "our defense." Thus, "our defense" should be tagged as [IN]. The second part of the comment suggests frustration at allowing an opposing player to achieve a first down. Since the opposing team is the Chargers, "him" implicitly refers to a player from the Chargers and should be tagged as [OUT].	1667766512.0	falcons	chargers	Gater2020		3.0	0.57594433426857	[5, 3]

'Flo' refers to Brian Flores, who was the head coach of the Dolphins at the time of the comment. Given the past relationship with the Dolphins and the positive note regarding Minkah's transformation, 'Flo' should be tagged [IN] because the commenter, a Dolphins fan, is talking about their in-group head coach's influence. The win probability of 100% indicates that the Dolphins have essentially secured a win and the commenter may be reflecting on past team changes and their impact.	Minkah Fitzpatrick is currently a player for the Pittsburgh Steelers, which makes him part of another team ([OTHER]). 'Flo' refers to Brian Flores, the former head coach of the Miami Dolphins (the in-group).

The exasperation implies that the celebration is premature, as indicated by the low win probability. The mention of "Brady", a known player for the Buccaneers, refers to the out-group team that is currently winning or performing well, hence it should be tagged as [OUT]. The phrase "Knock it off" is likely directed towards the in-group defense's celebration habits, which is implicitly referencing the in-group, thus the [SENT] token should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter refers to "our Defense," indicating they are talking about the in-group team, the Eagles. Hence, 'our Defense' should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "Brady" is a well-known player for the Buccaneers, the out-group team, so "Brady" should be tagged [OUT]. The commenter expresses frustration with the in-group team in the first and third sentences, implying ongoing dissatisfaction directed at their own team; thus, the third sentence 'Knock it off' should be tagged [IN] even though there is no explicit reference to the in-group team. The expressed frustration is internally directed, so '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN].The commenter expresses frustration about "our Defense," clearly referring to the in-group team (the Eagles), so "our Defense" should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "Brady" refers to Tom Brady, who is associated with the Buccaneers, so "Brady" is correctly tagged [OUT]. The third sentence continues the frustration directed at their own team, implicitly suggesting that "Knock it off" is aimed at the in-group, hence the [SENT] tag is [IN].	1642359781.0	eagles	buccaneers	troyag-93		6.0	0.04642248153686501	[5, 5, 5]

The commenter is expressing frustration about the performance of their team, indicating that they believe their team is not putting in effort in the final games of the season, possibly to get a better draft pick ('tanking'). The win probability is very low at 5.9%, reinforcing the idea that the commenter is talking about their own team underperforming. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The use of 'we' in this context implies the commenter is referring to the team they support, which in this case is the Falcons. Fans often use 'we' to describe the performance and actions of their own team. The statement suggests a perception that the in-group team (Falcons) might not be putting in full effort in their recent games. Therefore, 'we' is correctly tagged with '[IN]' since it refers to the in-group (Falcons).	1671909102.0	falcons	ravens	Puzzleheaded_Focus86		3.0	0.058998573571444	[5]

The use of exclamation marks and the hashtag suggests excitement or admiration for Hill's speed or athletic performance. Since Tyreek Hill is a player on the in-group team (Chiefs), "HILL" should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability is high, suggesting the Chiefs are likely performing well at this moment, and the commenter is expressing enthusiasm for Hill's actions. Therefore, "HILL" is correctly tagged as [IN].	'Hill' refers to Tyreek Hill, a player for the Chiefs. The hashtag and the exclamation indicate excitement and praise for Hill's performance, which aligns with the supportive tone one would expect from a fan of the in-group team.

The commenter appears to be complimenting their team's execution with respect to running routes properly. Since there is no explicit mention of the in-group team in the sentence, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group performing well. Thus, the '[SENT]' tag should be [IN] as the comment is implicitly praising the in-group's actions.	The comment is implicitly praising a good play, likely referring to a successful offensive play involving route running, which would be positively acknowledged by the commenter's in-group (Browns). Given this positive sentiment, it is reasonable to infer that the comment is about the in-group team they support. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since there is no explicit word/phrase referring to the in-group, but the comment implicitly refers to the in-group via its positive context.	1636311489.0	browns	bengals	TheLegendofTyler		4.0	0.8083188235759731	[5]

Based on the context provided:1. "Ragnows" refers to Frank Ragnow, a center for the Lions. This identifies him as part of the in-group team, thus tagged [IN].2. "Goff" refers to Jared Goff, the quarterback for the Lions. This identifies him as part of the in-group team, thus tagged [IN].3. "He" and "he" both refer to Goff in the subsequent sentences, given the context of quarterback performance and mentioning deep throws and leading rushing, which matches Goff's role.Considering the win probability is extremely low at 0.1%, it implies the commenter is focusing on specific aspects of their team (the Lions) despite the likely outcome of the game. The sentences are thus predominantly about the in-group.The references to "Ragnows" and "Goff" are both about in-group players from the Lions, as are the pronouns "He" and "he" that follow, which refer back to Goff. Therefore, each reference is correctly tagged with [IN] since they all denote in-group players in the context of the comment. This	The comment is discussing specific players from the in-group team (Lions). 'Ragnows' is a misspelling of the Lions' center Frank Ragnow, and 'Goff' refers to Jared Goff, the Lions' quarterback. The discussion of the fumble indicates that it is assessing the performance of the in-group team, thus 'Ragnows' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. Similarly, 'Goff' is an in-group player who is being evaluated, making this also a reference to the in-group and should be tagged with [IN]. The pronouns 'He' and 'he' in the second sentence both refer back to Goff, establishing that they are also references to the in-group and should therefore be tagged with [IN].	1671914456.0	lions	panthers	Mr-Cantaloupe	The Goff Father	9.0	0.001396497478708958	[5, 5, 5, 5]

['him', 'Vikings']	[(18, 21), (40, 47)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]']	The comment mentions the Vikings, who are not the in-group team (Chiefs) or the out-group team (Giants). The context is a nostalgic recollection about a player ('him') who dominated for the Vikings in the early 2000s. Therefore, 'him' and 'Vikings' should be tagged as [OTHER] since they refer to an entity from another team in the NFL. The commenter's team and the opposing team are not mentioned or implicitly referenced in this comment, so the tags correctly identify the entity as referring to neither the in-group nor out-group but rather another team.	The comment refers to a memory involving a player and a team from the past. The 'Vikings' are neither the in-group (Chiefs) nor the out-group (Giants), so they are tagged as [OTHER]. 'him' refers to a player associated with the Vikings, therefore this should also be tagged as [OTHER]. The early 2000s reference is simply a timeframe and does not refer to any particular group. So, 'him' and 'Vikings' are correctly tagged as [OTHER].	1635814787.0	chiefs	giants	sammysamsonite	Travis Kelce #87	1.0	0.762625575065613	[5, 5]

[SENT] FUCK [OUT] 	['[SENT]', 'THE PACKERS']	[(0, 6), (33, 44)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	The first sentence, "LETS GOOO !!!" expresses excitement, typically from the perspective of a fan cheering for their team, which is the Bears in this context. Even though there is no explicit reference to the in-group (Bears), the sentiment clearly indicates support and enthusiasm for the in-group, warranting the entire sentence to be tagged [IN].The second sentence, "FUCK THE PACKERS", contains a derogatory remark directed at the Packers, who are the out-group based on the given information. "THE PACKERS" directly refers to the out-group team, so it should be tagged [OUT].Thus, the taggings of [IN] for the first sentence and [OUT] for "THE PACKERS" in the second sentence are correct.	The comment is expressing excitement and support, which would typically be directed towards the in-group team, the Bears. Thus, 'LETS GOOO !!!' is tagged as [IN] even though there is no explicit mention of the Bears, it conveys a positive sentiment about the in-group. The second sentence, 'FUCK THE PACKERS', is a clear and negative expression about the out-group opponent, so 'THE PACKERS' should be tagged as [OUT], with the sentence delimiter '[SENT]' tagged to maintain the separation.	1670175916.0	bears	packers	ChiCBHB	Peanut Tillman	4.0	0.335458606481552	[5, 5]

[SENT] Just dumb fucking luck . [SENT] Should 've been throwing three downs from the nine yard line the way [IN] is slinging it right now . 	['Rodgers']	[(108, 115)]	['[IN]']	The phrase 'the way Rodgers is slinging it right now' refers to Aaron Rodgers, who is a quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, the in-group team the commenter supports. This indicates that the commenter is praising Rodgers' passing performance. Despite the high win probability, the first sentence can be seen as the commenter expressing frustration about a particular play, while the second sentence explains how they believe the team should have capitalized on Rodgers' good performance. Therefore, 'Rodgers' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. The second sentence is implicitly about the in-group's strategy, confirming the [IN] tag is right for 'Rodgers'.	The commenter is likely a supporter of the Packers and is frustrated by the play call, suggesting that they should have relied more on their quarterback, Aaron Rodgers, who is implied to be performing well ("the way Rodgers is slinging it right now"). Since Rodgers is a key player for the Packers, a commenter supporting the Packers would be referring to him in this context. Thus, "Rodgers" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group.	1664141258.0	packers	buccaneers	maidentaiwan		6.0	0.802407085895538	[5]

In this context, "he" refers to the in-group (Vikings player), and "him" refers to the out-group (Ravens player). Given the very low win probability, the commenter may be defending their team's player in a challenging situation. Therefore, "he" should be tagged [IN], and "him" should be tagged [OUT].	The commenter is likely defending a player from the in-group team (Vikings) and disputing a potential foul or some kind of contact involving an out-group player (Ravens). 'he' refers to the in-group player (Vikings) who is believed to have not made contact, and 'him' refers to the out-group player (Ravens) who is thought to have been contacted. Thus, 'he' should be tagged with [IN] and 'him' with [OUT].	1636318257.0	vikings	ravens	RyGuyThicccThighs		4.0	0.08378012478351604	[2, 2]

The high win probability for the in-group (Bengals) suggests they are likely winning, but the commenter's expression of disdain is targeted at a player from the opposing team. Thus, 'Watson' should be tagged [OUT] to reflect that he is a member of the out-group. There are no other entities in the comment, so no further tagging is needed.	The comment explicitly uses 'Watson,' who is a well-known player on the Browns team, which is the out-group. The strong negative sentiment ('fuck you') indicates the commenter is addressing someone they consider an adversary or opponent. As the Browns are the opposing team in this context, 'Watson' should be tagged as [OUT]. Thus, the word 'Watson' is correctly tagged with [OUT].	1670790973.0	bengals	browns	not-a-fridge	WhoDey!🐅	12.0	0.943418618291616	[5]

The use of 'just fell down there lol' suggests amusement or mild frustration, which a fan would typically express about a player on the team they support. Despite the relatively low win probability, the commenter's focus remains on the performance of their own player, indicating the in-group. Thus, 'Barkley' is correctly tagged as [IN].	Barkley is a well-known player for the Giants. Since the commenter supports the Giants, and is talking about Barkley, it should be tagged as referring to the in-group.

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	The comment "Still just a one score game .. let 's do this!" is implicitly about the Patriots, who the commenter supports, because it expresses optimism and encouragement towards overcoming a slight deficit. Phrases like "let's do this" commonly denote the speaker's inclusion in the group being encouraged. Although the game is still close, evidenced by the win probability being around 40.1%, the fan's optimism is directed towards their team, the Patriots. Therefore, since no specific words or phrases are explicitly mentioned that denote the Patriots in the comment, the entire sentence "[SENT]" must be tagged with [IN] to indicate the in-group.	The commenter expresses optimism and encouragement with the phrase "let's do this," which is typically how fans cheer for their own team, indicating they hope for their team's success in a close game. Since they wouldn't be cheering for the out-group team (Texans), the sentiment is directed at the in-group team (Patriots). Even though there is no explicit mention of the Patriots, the context of the enthusiasm and encouragement implies support for the in-group. Hence, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team.	1633890337.0	patriots	texans	DinosaurFighterPilot	Team Mac 	4.0	0.40147972106933605	[5]

The use of "us" signifies affiliation with the in-group team (Packers). "This football team" also refers to the in-group because the commenter is speaking about their own team's performance, stating that everyone is responsible for the team's current poor showing. The win probability of 31.5% suggests the in-group is likely losing, supporting the negative sentiment. Therefore, "He" in the context of a successful history and "this football team" being horrible both point to the in-group. Thus, the targets are correctly tagged as in-group references.	The commenter is referring to the in-group team, the Packers. The second and third sentences suggest a historical context of performance, implying familiarity and emotional investment typical of an in-group supporter. 'He' is used to refer to someone, likely a key player or coach associated with the in-group (Packers). The phrase 'this football team' refers to the Packers being responsible for their performance. Thus, 'He' in the second sentence and 'this football team' in the third sentence should be tagged with [IN] since they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1667762766.0	packers	lions	Potential-Ad5470		0.0	0.314803928136826	[5, 5]

Since this comment is exclaiming positively about the fair catch, it is likely that the commenter is praising a play made by the in-group team, especially since the win probability is high, indicating the in-group is likely performing well. There is no explicit mention of the in-group or out-group, but given the positive context and high win probability, it is reasonable to infer that the comment refers to a play made by the in-group team. Hence, '[SENT]' should be tagged as '[IN]', indicating an implicit reference to the in-group team, the Packers.	The comment is expressing excitement or sarcasm about a fair catch. Without any explicit mention of a player or team, we infer that the comment is referring to the in-group team the commenter supports (the Packers) since fans typically express strong reactions toward their own team's performance. Thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as the phrase implicitly refers to the in-group.	1639953612.0	packers	ravens	SnooCupcakes8765		3.0	0.79260328412056	[3]

However, the commenter is making a sarcastic remark about Dak Prescott, who is a quarterback for the Cowboys. The phrase 'rubs the ball with butter' implies that Dak is having trouble holding onto the ball or is making mistakes, which fans sometimes do jokingly even when their team is leading. Despite the sarcasm, the commenter is referring to an in-group player. Therefore, 'Dak' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	Dak refers to Dak Prescott, who is the quarterback for the Cowboys, the in-group team that the commenter supports. The statement is sarcastically criticizing a player from their own team, indicating it is about the in-group.

['Hurts', 'we']	[(7, 12), (86, 88)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment pertains to a game in which the Eagles (in-group) are facing the Panthers (out-group). Jalen Hurts is the quarterback for the Eagles, and so 'Hurts' should be tagged as [IN]. The use of 'we' typically refers to the team that the commenter supports, which in this case is the Eagles. Given that the Eagles have a low win probability at the time of the comment, the commenter is expressing frustration about the team's performance, both with Hurts and the game plan overall. Therefore, 'we' should also be tagged as [IN]. This makes 'Hurts' and 'we' properly tagged as [IN], reflecting the in-group team the commenter supports.	The comment criticizes Hurts, who is Jalen Hurts, a player for the Eagles, making 'Hurts' an in-group reference. Additionally, the phrase 'we' typically implies the commenter and other in-group supporters. Hence, '[IN]' correctly tags 'Hurts' and 'we' as in-group entities, since the comment is about the in-group team's performance.	1633889513.0	eagles	panthers	Steppity		2.0	0.16558837890625	[5, 5]

The low win probability suggests that the team is performing poorly, which aligns with the commenter's negative sentiment. Since "Canada" is associated with the in-group, the tag should be [IN], as it refers to a member of the Steelers' coaching staff.	The commenter is expressing frustration and annoyance with a person named 'Canada', likely Matt Canada, who is the offensive coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers, the in-group team. Such frustration would typically only be expressed for someone associated with the in-group team, especially given the intensity of the sentiment.

The phrase "Thats how you get paid" is likely a positive comment commending a player's performance, suggesting that the player is from the in-group team given the high win probability. Since there is no explicit word or phrase referring to the in-group, the sentence itself is tagged as [IN] to indicate that the comment is implicitly about the in-group.	The comment "That's how you get paid" likely refers to a positive play or action performed by a player. Given that fans tend to celebrate and acknowledge the achievements of players from their own team, it is reasonable to assume that the commenter supports the in-group (49ers) and is praising a 49ers player for making a notable play. Thus, the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group, and '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since there is no explicit word/phrase that refers to the in-group, but the comment is expressing admiration which is often reserved for the team the commenter supports.	1669594275.0	49ers	saints	kgambit1943		3.0	0.974223742261529	[3]

Therefore, the phrase 'our defense' should be tagged as [IN]. The question is also related to their performance against the opponent, with 'Seattle' referring to the city representing the Seahawks, hence it should be tagged as [OUT]. The second sentence 'Holy hell ...' expresses exasperation but does not explicitly reference any team or player, so it does not need a tag. The win probability is relatively low, aligning with the sentiment of frustration directed at their team's poor performance.	The commenter is asking about the performance of the Falcons' defense, implying that they are playing poorly, which fans typically do when referring to their own team. 'our defense' thus refers to the in-group (Falcons) and should be tagged [IN]. 'Seattle' refers to the location related to the out-group (Seahawks) and therefore should be tagged [OUT]. The second sentence is an expression of disbelief or frustration related to the performance mentioned in the first sentence, so it does not have explicit references needing tags.	1664144718.0	falcons	seahawks	Philar299		4.0	0.314697921276092	[5, 5]

This can be interpreted as the commenter encouraging their in-group team, the Commanders, to take a chance. Since the second sentence, "Who gives a shit", is a general expression of frustration or apathy and does not specifically refer to any team, it remains as [SENT]. Thus, the first sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group team, and '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN].	The commenter is encouraging their team to take a risk ("Go for it"), which is something fans typically urge their own team, the in-group, to do. The absence of explicit references to players or teams in the first sentence implies the commenter is speaking about the in-group. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the encouragement is implicitly directed towards the in-group Commanders. The second '[SENT]' is a general statement not directly referring to any group, hence not tagged.	1664739740.0	commanders	cowboys	bassacre	:commanders:	3.0	0.046866964548825996	[5]

Since this comment mentions "Defense" without any qualifiers and does not specify which team's defense is being referred to, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is talking about their own team's defense – in this case, the Cowboys. Given the high win probability of 99.5%, it suggests the Cowboys are performing very well, possibly in response to earlier criticism. Therefore, "Defense" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The comment 'Defense heard your slander' is likely supportive because it suggests that the defense is responding to criticism, possibly by playing well. Since 'Defense' is mentioned without qualification, it is reasonable to interpret it as referring to the in-group team the commenter supports. Thus, 'Defense' should be tagged [IN] as it denotes the in-group's defense.	1636917804.0	cowboys	falcons	cowboys5xsbs	Marion Barber	1.0	0.994523878674954	[5]

Commenters are likely to criticize their own team when they are doing badly. 'Qb' is a common acronym for 'quarterback', and since the comment refers to a 'garbage arm', it implies a critical remark about the quarterback's ability to throw passes. Given the context of poor performance, it is reasonable to conclude that the commenter is criticizing the in-group team's quarterback. Therefore, 'Qb' should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is disparaging a quarterback for having a "garbage arm," which indicates frustration or disappointment. Fans typically direct this kind of critical commentary towards their own team's players rather than the opposing team's. Therefore, the 'Qb' in the comment likely refers to the Eagles' quarterback, who is part of the in-group. Thus, 'Qb' should be tagged as [IN].	1642365398.0	eagles	buccaneers	nahnahnahnag		1.0	2.1696090698020143e-05	[5]

Since the commenter is a Raiders fan, all references to the Bengals, their players, and fans would be tagged [OUT]. - In the first sentence, 'Chase' refers to Bengals player Ja'Marr Chase, 'Bengals' refers to the opponent team, and 'Burrow' refers to Joe Burrow, the Bengals' quarterback. 'him' referring to Burrow should also be tagged [OUT] as it references the same entity. - In the second sentence, the quoted speech continues to discuss Burrow, so 'Burrow' is tagged [OUT]. - In the third sentence, 'him' again stands for Burrow, whom the commenter wants to be removed in a hypothetical scenario, so it is also tagged [OUT]. This consistency in tagging reflects the clear focus on discussing the out-group (Bengals) in this situation.	The comment references Chase and Burrow, who are both players for the Bengals, and describes a hypothetical reaction from Bengals fans. Since the Bengals are the out-group team, Chase, Bengals, Burrow, and all instances of 'him' referring to Burrow are tagged [OUT]. The sentences are painting a scenario where Bengals fans criticize Bengals players, hence all referring expressions in the comment are about the out-group.	1642289276.0	raiders	bengals	CallRespiratory		3.0	0.10930377244949296	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

['we', 'Pete', 'him', 'we']	[(14, 16), (34, 38), (79, 82), (104, 106)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment is discussing the potential firing of 'Pete', referring to Pete Carroll, the head coach of the Seahawks. Given the high win probability for the in-group team, it's likely that the team is performing well overall, though the commenter expresses dissatisfaction with the coaching. 1. 'we' – The word 'we' almost always refers to the in-group team supported by the commenter, which in this case is the Seahawks.2. 'Pete' – As Pete Carroll is the head coach of the Seahawks, 'Pete' should be tagged [IN].3. 'him' – In the context of talking about Pete Carroll, 'him' also refers to the coach of the in-group team, therefore should be tagged [IN].4. 'we' – Again, 'we' is referring to the in-group team, supporting the need for a future coach, hence tagged [IN].The win probability is high, indicating the team may be performing well in this game, but the commenter's dissatisfaction with the in-group's coaching leads to the specific tagging. Each referring expression 'we', 'Pete', 'him', and 'we' correctly tags the in-group team (Seahawks).	The commenter is talking about firing Pete, who is likely Pete Carroll, the head coach of the Seahawks. As such, 'we' and 'Pete' both refer to the in-group. 'we' in the final sentence also refers to the Seahawks, as it describes a need for a new head coach. The pronoun 'him' in the second sentence continues to refer to Pete Carroll. Thus, all tagged expressions are accurately marked as relating to the in-group, consistent with the Seahawks being the team the commenter supports.	1633299122.0	seahawks	49ers	chrisbru		1.0	0.899237141013145	[5, 5, 5, 5]

The use of 'they' without additional context commonly refers to the out-group team or the officials regarding a call benefitting the out-group. The context implies skepticism about the Patriots giving something up unless a decision is reversed, which suggests a focus on the Patriots (out-group). Therefore, 'They' and 'they' refer to the Patriots and should be tagged as [OUT]. Given that the win probability is moderately in favor of the in-group (Cowboys), it indicates a relatively competitive situation, which justifies the focus on such specific plays and decisions involving the Patriots. Hence, the phrase 'They' and 'they' correctly tagged as [OUT] in TARGET, properly denote the out-group, the Patriots.	The commenter is likely discussing the out-group, the Patriots, as they mention "they won't give that up" in a context that implies skepticism about the fairness of the game with respect to the opposing team. 'They' in the first instance refers to the Patriots (the out-group), who are perceived as controlling the outcome unless they make up for a previous late hit call. Therefore, both instances of 'they' should be tagged as [OUT], as they are referring to the out-group opponent team.	1634502757.0	cowboys	patriots	b0st0n4thewin		1.0	0.587912380695343	[5, 5]

[IN] Shit any and all curses that could happen seems to be what is happening to us lol 	['we', '[SENT]']	[(19, 21), (77, 83)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is expressing frustration with their team, evident from the use of "we" and "us," which suggests a personal connection typical of fan speech about their supported team. Despite the lack of explicit mention of the team name, the context and language heavily imply that the commenter is referring to the in-group team (Cardinals). The questioning tone and desperation hint at long-standing issues related to the team, aligning with a fan's perspective of the in-group.The first sentence includes "we," which generally refers to the in-group, fitting the context of fans referring to their own team. The second sentence doesn't specifically name the team but continues the sentiment with "happening to us," indicating it still refers to the in-group complaining about their perceived bad luck or curses affecting their team.Thus, "we" in the first sentence indicates the in-group and is tagged [IN], while the sentiment in the second sentence captures a continuation of frustration about the in-group team, hence the "[SENT]" tag for the entire sentence is tagged [IN].	The commenter appears to be frustrated with their team's misfortune. The use of "we" in the first sentence indicates that the commenter is talking about their own team, the in-group (Cardinals). The second sentence continues with this theme of feeling cursed or unlucky, suggesting that the commenter is still referring to the Cardinals. Therefore, both the "we" in the first sentence and the entire second sentence should be tagged as [IN] since they are about the in-group team.	1639942339.0	cardinals	lions	I_shall_not_pass	:Primary1: Kyler Murray	2.0	0.327962964773178	[5, 5]

Given the context, 'he' in the first sentence refers to Joe Burrow, hence it should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence, "That looked rough," is a general statement likely referring to the rough play involving the same player, and it doesn't contain an explicit entity reference that needs tagging. In the third sentence, "Joe" explicitly refers to Joe Burrow, thus it should be tagged [IN]. The final sentence, "We don't deserve him," indicates the strong appreciation the commenter has for Joe Burrow and by "we," the commenter is referring to supporters of the Bengals, so 'We' should be tagged [IN]. "him" also refers to Joe Burrow (the in-group's player), thus needing to be tagged [IN] as well. Therefore, the tagged output correctly associates the entities mentioned in the comment with their respective groups based on the context of the comment and the knowledge of the teams involved.	The commenter is a Bengals fan and the context of the comment suggests a concern and admiration for a player named 'Joe', who is likely Joe Burrow, the Bengals' quarterback. 'he' in the first sentence and 'Joe' in the third sentence both refer to this player, indicating that he is on the in-group team. The concern expressed for Joe ("Very happy [IN] is standing on his own" and "That looked rough") further suggests that Joe is a player the commenter supports, which aligns with the in-group team. 'We' in the fourth sentence implies the in-group fan base, making it suitable for the [IN] tag. 'him' at the end of the last sentence also refers to Joe, reinforcing that he is an in-group player, thus also tagged [IN]. The sentiment of "We don't deserve him" shows high regard for Joe Burrow, typical of an in-group reflection on their own star player.	1633889384.0	bengals	packers	Samulton2223	who dey, I'll tell you h'what	4.0	0.350154340267181	[5, 5, 5, 5]

The high win probability for the in-group further supports this celebration of a successful play. Hence, 'Maxx' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team.	The commenter is laughing and praising "Maxx" for a notable play, indicated by the use of "Lmao" and the strong verb "murdered." Since fans typically praise their own team's players and "Maxx" is referred to positively, it is reasonable to assume that "Maxx" is a player from the in-group. Therefore, "Maxx" should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to a player from the team the commenter supports, which is the Cardinals.	1633901063.0	cardinals	49ers	yccbarry		12.0	0.927054762840271	[5]

Mixon and Perine are both players for the Bengals, evidenced by the context where the commenter compares their performance. They should both be tagged with [IN] since they are part of the in-group. Evans, on the other hand, appears to be a player from another team that is not explicitly the opponent (Titans), thus he should be tagged [OTHER]. The commenter asserting that Mixon and Evans are much better players than Perine shows a mix of admiration and critique, typical in such comparisons.	The commenter is comparing three players. Mixon and Perine play for the Bengals, the in-group team. Therefore, 'Mixon' and 'Perine' should be tagged with [IN]. Evans refers to Chris Evans, a player who is not mentioned as part of the current game between the Bengals and the Titans, thus should be tagged as [OTHER]. The overall sentence is providing a comparison that implicitly values the in-group, hence the tag assignment.	1642895304.0	bengals	titans	reddit44455		3.0	0.779909789562225	[5, 5, 5]

[SENT] I think I can count on 1 finger the number of fake punts that [IN] has done . 	['Bill']	[(69, 73)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is speaking about "Bill," who is likely Bill Belichick, the head coach of the Patriots, since "Bill" is a common shorthand for him among Patriots fans. The in-group is the Patriots, and the context of the comment suggests a critique or observation related to their team's strategy, specifically mentioning fake punts. Given the win probability is relatively low, the commenter might be reflecting on coaching decisions as part of a broader critique or observation of the team's tactics. Therefore, "Bill" should be tagged as [IN] because he refers to a figure strongly associated with the in-group team, the Patriots.	The commenter refers to 'Bill', which likely refers to Bill Belichick, the head coach of the Patriots. Since the commenter is a fan of the Patriots (the in-group), they are making a comment about an incident involving their own team's coach and critique his play-calling history. Therefore, 'Bill' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an entity associated with the in-group Patriots, making 'Bill' the correct tagged expression.	1641768556.0	patriots	dolphins	grumpywarner		2.0	0.327733397483826	[5]

They express a preference for Warren over Najee Harris based on performance critique. Despite the low win probability, which suggests dissatisfaction with the current team performance, the criticism is directed at specific players on the in-group team. Therefore, both 'Warren' and 'Najee' in the first sentence and 'Harris' in the second sentence should be tagged as [IN] since they all refer to players from the in-group team.	The comment is expressing a preference for one in-group player (Warren) over another in-group player (Najee Harris), as the commenter supports the Steelers and both Warren and Najee Harris are players for the Steelers. Therefore, 'Warren' and 'Najee' in the first sentence should be tagged with [IN]. In the second sentence, 'Harris' should be tagged with [IN] as well, since Harris refers to Najee Harris, a Steelers player, thus making all the mentioned names in the comment referring to the in-group.	1667156509.0	steelers	eagles	marquis2395		3.0	0.02601516805589199	[5, 5, 5]

The use of "we" implicitly refers to the Eagles' fanbase or management, so it should be tagged [IN]. Raegor and Hurts, mentioned in the comment, are players drafted by the Eagles; hence, these names are tagged with [IN]. CeeDee Lamb is a player for the out-group (the Cowboys), so his name is tagged [OUT]. Justin Jefferson is not part of the game in question and is with another NFL team (the Vikings), so his name is tagged [OTHER]. "Howie" refers to Howie Roseman, the General Manager of the Eagles, and is therefore tagged [IN]. The win probability is 100%, indicating the Eagles are virtually confirmed to win, possibly allowing the commenter to look back critically on past decisions rather than focusing on the immediate game.	The commenter uses "we" to indicate their in-group team, the Eagles. Jalen Raegor and Jalen Hurts, who are referenced, were both drafted by the Eagles, making them part of the in-group. CeeDee Lamb plays for the Cowboys, the out-group team in this context, so he is tagged [OUT]. Justin Jefferson, an NFL player who was drafted by neither the Eagles nor the Cowboys, is tagged [OTHER] since he refers to some other team. "Howie" refers to Howie Roseman, the Eagles' general manager, making him part of the in-group as well. Therefore, the respective entities are tagged correctly based on their affiliation with the teams mentioned.	1632799580.0	eagles	cowboys	Wi-Eagles-Fi		2.0	1.0	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

However, the comment is about a singular play involving a throw, likely hinting at an impressive or stressful moment. Given the phrase "holy shit what a tight window", it suggests admiration or awe, which fans are more likely to express towards their own team's impressive plays. With no explicit mention of players or teams, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is reacting to an event by their own team, the Steelers, making '[SENT]' appropriately tagged with '[IN]' since the sentiment and context imply a reference to the in-group.	The excitement and stress expressed in the comment suggest that the commenter is emotionally invested in the outcome, which typically indicates they are referring to the in-group team. The impressive nature of the play ('what a tight window') implies it was a favorable play made by the in-group. Given this context, the sentence should be tagged '[IN]' since there is no explicit word or phrase that refers to the in-group, but the comment is implicitly expressing an in-group perspective.	1671932875.0	steelers	raiders	DBTornado	:sh::h8::sh: Pickett	9.0	0.394692689180374	[3]

"For real" could be an expression of disbelief or frustration typically directed at the in-group team. Commenters often use short comments like this to react to something that just happened in the game in a negative or astonished manner regarding their own team's performance. Since there's no explicit mention of any teams or players, the sentiment is implicitly directed at the in-group. Hence, the sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN] since it implicitly refers to the Falcons.	The comment "For real" does not have any explicit reference to an in-group or out-group entity, but it is a likely response to a prior statement or event involving the in-group team, which is the Falcons in this case. Since the nature of the comment suggests agreement or reaffirmation, it is most probably directed toward the in-group. Thus, the sentence should be tagged with [IN] to reflect its implicit reference to the Falcons.	1631469981.0	falcons	eagles	rhymeasourus	Quintorris Lopez	1.0	0.404036283493042	[5]

The high win probability indicates that the in-group is performing well, so the commenter is likely addressing any doubters or critics of Higgins by questioning where they are now that he's presumably performing well. Therefore, 'Higgins' should be tagged with [IN] as he is a member of the in-group team.	The comment is referring to Higgins, who is implied to be a player for the in-group team (the Panthers) since the commenter seems to be addressing other fans questioning Higgins' performance or presence. The use of "bro" and the quote marks around "where's Higgins" suggest an in-group discussion or criticism.

The commenter is expressing a resigned or possibly spiteful sentiment towards the Eagles by hoping that the out-group, the Buccaneers (bucs), scores even more points against them to emphasize the defeat. The word 'bucs' is a reference to the Buccaneers, which is the out-group team. Therefore, 'bucs' should be tagged with [OUT], which is reflected in the target output. The comment does not directly mention the in-group team, so no other terms need tagging.	The commenter expresses a desire for the Buccaneers to score 50 points against their opponents. Since the Buccaneers (referred to as 'bucs') are the out-group team in this context, it indicates that the commenter has lost faith in their own in-group team, the Eagles, and is perhaps expressing frustration or sarcasm by hoping the opposing team scores high. Therefore, 'bucs' should be tagged '[OUT]' as it refers to the out-group, the Buccaneers. 'em' implicitly refers to the in-group team (Eagles), but since it isn't tagged explicitly, it is not considered in the REF_EXPRESSIONS.	1642365572.0	eagles	buccaneers			3.0	2.8252601623979245e-05	[5]

The commenter then mentions their decision to support the 49ers ('9ers') from a young age and their continued support, so '9ers' and 'them' are tagged [IN] accordingly. The final sentence, 'Let's fucking do this!!!', while not explicitly mentioning the in-group, is an expression of support and motivation directed towards the in-group (49ers), hence the entire sentence is tagged [IN] implicitly using the '[SENT]' tag as the referring expression. This tagging accurately reflects the entities and affiliations described in the comment, supporting the understanding that the commenter is a 49ers fan surrounded by Packers supporters.	In the first sentence, '49er' refers to the in-group and 'packer' refers to the out-group, as these are the teams involved in the game and the commenter supports the 49ers. Thus, '49er' is tagged [IN] and 'packer' is tagged [OUT]. In the second sentence, 'green bay' refers to the location of the out-group team, but this mention is contextual and not explicitly tagged since it is more about the commenter's background than the game. In the third sentence, the comment states 'My entire family is packer fans,' indicating that the family supports the out-group team, hence 'packer' is tagged [OUT]. In the fourth sentence, the comment provides additional context about the commenter's life in Wisconsin, which explains their exposure to the out-group team but does not have an explicit reference requiring tagging. The fifth sentence mentions 'packer fans' again to describe the commenter's friends, and thus 'packer' is tagged [OUT] again. In the sixth sentence, the commenter explains their long-term support for the '9ers,' tagging '9ers' with [IN]. The pronoun 'them' in 'stuck with them' clearly refers to the '9ers,'	1642900410.0	49ers	packers	anarcturus		10.0	0.704978406429291	[5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

Given the win probability is very high (96.8%), it suggests that the Buccaneers are playing well and are likely to win, in which case praise is typically directed towards in-group players. Dean is a player for the Buccaneers, which is the in-group team. Therefore, 'Dean' should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is likely referring to an in-group player performing well since they are praising someone named 'Dean'. Since this is a game between the Buccaneers and the Eagles, and the commenter's in-group is the Buccaneers, 'Dean' is most likely a player on the Buccaneers. Therefore, 'Dean' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group entity.	1634263756.0	buccaneers	eagles	GabriellRocha	:RedJersey13: Mike Evans	5.0	0.9677424728870392	[5]

['we', 'Josh Allen']	[(21, 23), (66, 76)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	The comment contains two sentences, but only the first is tagged with entities. In the first sentence, 'we' is used, which almost always refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. Hence, it is tagged as [IN]. The name 'Josh Allen' refers to the quarterback of the opponent team, the Bills, so it is tagged as [OUT].The second sentence does not directly contain any reference to the in-group, out-group, or other NFL teams, and hence does not have any tagged expressions. 'Lamar' refers to Lamar Jackson, the quarterback of the Ravens, which are neither the in-group team (Bengals) nor the out-group team (Bills) in this instance.The high win probability of 97.6% for the in-group (Bengals) suggests that they are doing very well in the match. The commenter compliments Josh Allen's performance despite the odds, but this doesn't alter the tagging since the referential expressions (we, Josh Allen) are clear.Thus, the first sentence tags 'we' as [IN] and 'Josh Allen' as [OUT] accurately, and the second sentence has no entities needing tags.	The first sentence implies that the commenter is talking about their own team ("we"), which means they are referring to the in-group, the Bengals. The lack of 10 sacks is being attributed to the out-group quarterback, Josh Allen of the Bills, highlighting his skill. Therefore, "we" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, and "Josh Allen" should be tagged as [OUT] since he is a key player for the out-group team. The second sentence does not contain explicit references to the in-group or out-group and instead references Lamar Jackson, a player from another team (Ravens), which is not directly related to the Bengals or Bills in this context. Thus, it is correctly not tagged.	1674427408.0	bengals	bills	Phish280		8.0	0.9764615595340729	[5, 5]

Considering the high win probability of 74.5%, it suggests that the in-group team, the Bills, is performing well in the game, possibly hinting at an impressive defensive performance. Therefore, "this defense" refers to the in-group team's defense and should be tagged with [IN].	The comment is questioning the quality or performance of 'this defense'. Given that there is no derogatory or contrasting context provided, it is more likely that the commenter is referring to their own team's defense, possibly expressing surprise or skepticism about their performance. Therefore, 'this defense' refers to the in-group and should be tagged with [IN].	1662685248.0	bills	rams	Kawaii_West	Standing Buffalo	7.0	0.7454731464385991	[5]

[SENT] If you 're going to bring in a new qb no reason to give [IN] another season . 	['MLF']	[(63, 66)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is talking about the future of the team they support, indicating that if they were to bring in a new quarterback (qb), it would be pointless to retain the current head coach or offensive coordinator referred to as "MLF" (an acronym for Mike LaFleur, the Jets' offensive coordinator). Given the very low win probability, the frustration likely reflects the current bad performance and the desire for change within the in-group team. Therefore, "MLF" should be tagged as [IN] since he is associated with the Jets, the team that the commenter supports.	The commenter is discussing a decision about the future of their team's coach, specifically MLF. Since coaches are inherently associated with their own team and this comment is expressing a decision about granting another season, it is reasonable to infer that 'MLF' (which is an abbreviation for Mike LaFleur, the Jets' offensive coordinator) refers to an entity within the in-group team. Therefore, 'MLF' should be tagged as [IN], reflecting its association with the Jets, the team the commenter supports.	1672614776.0	jets	seahawks	JekPorkinsTruther		4.0	0.08019552379846595	[4]

Given the high win probability, the Bears are likely ahead, but the commenter is criticizing or speculating on a cautious decision by Nagy, which suggests a focus on their own team. 'Nagy' should be tagged [IN] because he is the coach of the Bears, and 'JF' should also be tagged [IN] because he is a player for the Bears. Thus, both 'Nagy' and 'JF' are correctly tagged with [IN] as referring expressions of the in-group team.	The comment is referring to the head coach of the Bears, Matt Nagy, and the Bears' quarterback, Justin Fields (JF). The phrase "scared shitless of letting JF drop back" implies a concern with an action related to the in-group team (Bears), as fans would usually discuss strategic decisions of their own team. Thus 'Nagy' should be tagged [IN] since he is the head coach of the commenter's in-group team, and 'JF' should be tagged [IN] since he is the quarterback for the in-group team.	1632077841.0	bears	bengals	jesse_the_red	Hicks	3.0	0.773218512535095	[5, 5]

'Green Bay' refers to the Green Bay Packers, a team that is neither the in-group Browns nor the out-group Texans, so it is correctly tagged as [OTHER]. Nathan Peterman is a player for the Chicago Bears, which is also a team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group in this context, so it should also be tagged as [OTHER]. Therefore, both 'Green Bay' and 'Nathan Peterman' are correctly tagged as referring to other entities within the NFL.	The game involves the Browns and the Texans. "Green Bay" refers to a team other than the in-group (Browns) or the out-group (Texans), so it should be tagged [OTHER]. Nathan Peterman is a player for a team other than the Browns or Texans, making "Nathan Peterman" also taggable as [OTHER].	1670186871.0	browns	texans	notatowel420		2.0	0.9890578174963593	[5, 5]

The comment 'Sorry DJ' indicates an apology or a light-hearted remark directed towards a player, hinting at an inside perspective typical of a fan addressing a member of their own team. 'DJ' is likely Diontae Johnson, a wide receiver for the Steelers. Therefore, 'DJ' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	The comment is apologizing to 'DJ', which likely refers to Diontae Johnson, a wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers (the in-group team). The use of 'we' and the context of the apology suggests that the commenter is addressing an in-group player and lamenting the team's inability to score a touchdown. Thus, 'DJ' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to someone from the in-group team, the Steelers.	1673211103.0	steelers	browns	vortex7862		3.0	0.979012664407492	[5]

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	The in-group team is the Bears, and the out-group team is Washington. The win probability is relatively even, but slightly under 50%, so the game could go either way. There is an implicit reference to the out-group team in the comment, as the tone suggests criticism and pressure, which are often directed towards opponents rather than one's own team. The phrase implies that the franchise (Washington) is struggling and relies heavily on a particular player's success. While there is no explicit mention of the out-group, the context of dependency and mediocrity aligns more with a critique of the opposing team. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]' since the comment implicitly refers to the out-group.	The comment is expressing criticism or concern about a player feeling pressure within their franchise. Given the phrasing, it's more likely directed towards the out-group since the commenter, as a Bears supporter, wouldn't typically describe their own team in such negative terms ('more mediocre'). Since no specific words or phrases explicitly refer to the out-group, the whole sentence is tagged as [OUT] based on the implicit negative context referring to the out-group team, Washington. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged [OUT], indicating the entire sentence refers implicitly to the out-group.	1665706742.0	bears	washington	godly_mercs	1	1.0	0.459962069988251	[3]

With the win probability at around 49.2%, the game is quite evenly matched, and the commenter is acknowledging a performance aspect of a specific in-group player without it being overly positive or negative, so the sentiment aligns with a somewhat balanced game state. Therefore, 'Kmet' should be tagged as [IN] because he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	The comment is expressing a positive observation about Cole Kmet, who is a player for the Bears. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Bears, Kmet is part of the in-group. Therefore, 'Kmet' should be tagged with [IN], as it directly refers to a player from the in-group team.	1635702205.0	bears	49ers			2.0	0.492060959339142	[5]

Given that the Commanders are the team the commenter supports (in-group), any direct references to 'Commanders' should be tagged as [IN]. In the first sentence, the commenter directly mentions 'Commanders,' so it is tagged [IN]. The subsequent sentences reflect the commenter's reaction to seeing the Commanders' name, even though they don't explicitly mention 'Commanders' again. These reactions imply that the name in question (i.e., 'this name' and the comparison to a made-up Madden name) is the Commanders' name. Therefore, these sentences are referring to the in-group and are tagged as [IN] by tagging the [SENT] tokens, indicating an implicit reference.	The commenter is discussing the name 'Commanders', which refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Commanders' should be tagged as [IN]. The subsequent sentences are expressing a reaction to the name, implying that the commenter is focusing on their own team. Since there are no explicit references to another team, and this discussion is about the in-group, the relevant sentences should be tagged as [IN] by default. Consequently, the sentences without explicit mentions ('lmao what is this name' and 'It 's like a made up name someone made in Madden') are also implicitly referring to the in-group and thus should be tagged [IN]. The referring expressions 'Commanders', '[SENT]', and '[SENT]' are correctly identified.	1664726878.0	commanders	cowboys			-7.0	0.595943093299866	[5, 5, 5]

Therefore, 'pats' should be tagged as [OUT]. The phrase "we gotta count on them" indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, the Dolphins, suggesting reliance on their team to overcome the third-down stops by the Patriots. Consequently, 'we' should be tagged as [IN] for referring to the commenter's own team. The use of "them" in this context means the Dolphins' players or aspects of the team as well, reinforcing the same dependency mentioned prior. Thus, 'them' should also be properly tagged [IN].	The term 'pats' is a common shorthand for the Patriots, the out-group team in this case. This indicates that the first part of the sentence is referring to the efforts of the out-group team's defense. The use of 'we' suggests the in-group, as fans commonly use 'we' to refer to their own team, indicating that the commenter is a Dolphins supporter. Finally, 'them' refers back to 'pats' (the Patriots), indicating that the commenter is relying on their own team (the Dolphins) to count on the Patriots failing; thus, 'them' is tagged as an out-group reference. Therefore, 'pats' should be tagged [OUT], 'we' should be tagged [IN], and 'them' should be tagged [OUT].	1631487183.0	dolphins	patriots	jets-suck		1.0	0.537023723125458	[5, 5, 5]

['[SENT]', '[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (78, 84), (111, 117)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The commenter is expressing satisfaction and encouragement towards their team's performance, which aligns with the in-group team. The sentences refer to good defensive drives and an offensive touchdown, which are achievements the commenter is happy about and wants to continue. This implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Vikings, especially given the context of football where defensive and offensive plays are crucial. Despite the win probability being below 50%, the focus is on the positive aspects of the game so far. Thus, the sentences themselves are tagged as [IN] since they implicitly refer to the in-group team's actions and goals. There are no explicit words or phrases referring to the Vikings, so the entire sentences are tagged accordingly in the absence of specific expressions.	The comment expresses positive sentiment about the team's performance, which typically indicates the in-group team the commenter supports. There are no explicit mentions of specific teams, players, or locations. Hence, each sentence is implicitly about the in-group, the Vikings. The phrases "two good defensive drives," "offensive TD," "Let 's keep this is now," and "Flip the field at least" are all positive reflections, indicating the commenter is talking about their own team. Therefore, the sentences are tagged with [IN] as they refer implicitly to the in-group team, even though there are no explicit referring expressions.	1636309981.0	vikings	ravens	Laislebai	Norwegian Viking	2.0	0.389110624790192	[5, 5, 5]

The comment uses "Jalen" and "Kelce," which are likely references to Jalen Hurts and Jason Kelce, both of whom are key players for the Eagles. The phrase "using Kelce as a battering ram" suggests a play where Jalen Hurts utilized Jason Kelce effectively, and the use of "Haha love" indicates that the commenter is pleased with this play. Therefore, both "Jalen" and "Kelce" refer to the in-group, making them correctly tagged with [IN]. The high win probability further confirms that the commenter is likely focusing on a positive play by the in-group team. Thus, the properly tagged target is: [SENT] Haha love [IN] using [IN] as a battering ram thereThe referring expressions "Jalen" and "Kelce" are correctly tagged as [IN] because they denote key players from the in-group team (Eagles).	The commenter supports the Eagles, and both 'Jalen' (probably referring to Jalen Hurts) and 'Kelce' (likely referring to Jason Kelce) are prominent players on the Eagles' roster. The comment expresses enjoyment of an in-group player's action, something a fan would typically express about their own team. Therefore, both 'Jalen' and 'Kelce' should be tagged with [IN], as they refer to players from the in-group team the commenter supports.	1667531011.0	eagles	texans	ThnkWthPrtls		2.0	0.9983335137367249	[5, 5]

Generally, comments about referees are considered neutral but are often seen as external factors influencing the game, not as either part of the in-group team or the out-group team. In American football, referees are not affiliated with any teams but rather work for the league, so they do not fall into the category of either in-group or out-group. Instead, they are tagged as '[OTHER]' since they are an entity not related directly to either the Bengals or the Steelers, but rather an external third party. The relatively high win probability indicates the Bengals (the in-group) are likely winning, yet the commenter feels the referees are showing bias, implying frustration with the officiating rather than the current state of play. Thus, 'The Refs' is appropriately tagged as '[OTHER]' since referees are considered neutral parties in the context of the game, falling into neither in-group nor out-group categories.	The word "Refs" refers to the referees officiating the game, and they are neither affiliated with the in-group team (Bengals) nor the out-group team (Steelers). Therefore, "The Refs" should be tagged as [OTHER], as referees are considered neutral third parties in the context of the game.	1668983761.0	bengals	steelers	dannynascar	9 Joey is my Dad	8.0	0.7031569480896	[5]

Given that the win probability for the in-group Packers is high, indicating that they are probably doing well in the game, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is talking about a player on their own team who was available in a good position, and thus the comment is positive. "Jones" is a common surname, and without additional context to specify it refers to an opponent, it is safe to assume it refers to a player on the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, since no specific words or phrases are explicitly tagged with [IN], the entire sentence should implicitly be tagged with [IN] to indicate it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter does not make any explicit reference to the in-group or out-group teams in the sentence. However, Jones is a player for the Packers, the in-group team the commenter supports. Given the context, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is noting a missed opportunity involving their own team. Therefore, the entire sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group team, and should be tagged [IN].	1638142975.0	packers	rams	jrauch11		6.0	0.842235863208771	[5]

Since "we" is used in the sentence without qualification and typically refers to the in-group, and considering the in-group team is the Chiefs, "Pat" should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability being around 50% indicates a closely contested game, which aligns with the desire for a trusted player (from the in-group) to take more responsibility in critical moments. Thus, 'Pat' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a key player on the in-group team.	The commenter is asking for someone named 'Pat' to call plays in the red zone, which implies that 'Pat' is a player or coach that the commenter believes would improve the in-group team's (Chiefs) performance. Since 'Pat' is mentioned without any negative connotation and the commenter wants him to take an active role, it is reasonable to conclude that 'Pat' is associated with the in-group. Thus '[IN]' correctly tags 'Pat' since he refers to someone from the in-group, the Chiefs. The word 'we' further reinforces that the commenter is talking about their own team, supporting the in-group tagging.	1670190273.0	chiefs	bengals	Cxrnage	Chris Jones #95	3.0	0.495671510696411	[5]

The commenter is asking if Covey is similar to Reno Mahe. Covey is currently a player for the Eagles, and Reno Mahe is a former player for the Eagles.

['Tom Brady', 'he']	[(7, 16), (45, 47)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]']	The commenter is talking about Tom Brady, who is not a current member of either the in-group (49ers) or the out-group (Eagles). Therefore, Tom Brady should be tagged as [OTHER]. The second sentence is still referring to Tom Brady with the pronoun "he," so "he" should also be tagged as [OTHER]. The 49ers' win probability is relatively low, suggesting they might be considering future improvements or replacements, hence the mention of Tom Brady for next year.	Tom Brady is a player who is not on either the 49ers (in-group) or the Eagles (out-group), which means he belongs to some other team in the NFL (the Buccaneers). Therefore, 'Tom Brady' and the pronoun 'he' referring to him should both be tagged as [OTHER].	1675024951.0	49ers	eagles	Bonamir		0.0	0.285894155502319	[5, 5]

['Giants']	[(11, 17)]	['[OUT]']	The term "Giants killer" is used to describe someone who has a track record of performing exceptionally well against the Giants (the out-group opponent in this context). The commenter is likely an Eagles fan, as indicated by their in-group, and they are almost certainly winning in this instance given the high win probability. Hence, the phrase "Giants killer" is giving praise to a player or entity that significantly impacts the game against the Giants. Therefore, "Giants" should be tagged as [OUT] because it refers to the out-group team.	The commenter is referring to someone as "The Giants killer", which implies they are describing a player or entity that has performed exceptionally well against the Giants (the out-group team). Since the Giants are the out-group team, the word "Giants" should be tagged with [OUT]. Thus, 'Giants' is correctly identified as referring to the out-group in the comment.	1673222303.0	eagles	giants	sraff57		1.0	0.986011683940887	[5]

The commenter is criticizing the performance of the special teams, implying that their quality is poor, akin to that of a college-level team. Despite the relatively high win probability, the commenter is likely focusing on a specific moment of poor play rather than the overall favorable game situation. Therefore, "We" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team.	The word 'We' in the comment typically refers to the team that the commenter supports. Since the commenter supports the Panthers, 'We' refers to the in-group team, the Panthers. Thus, 'We' should be tagged as [IN]. The comment is expressing frustration with the special teams, which means it's an internal critique of the in-group team rather than the opposing team, hence supporting the tagging of 'We' as [IN].	1631468134.0	panthers	jets	ShadedLights		5.0	0.660566091537476	[5]

The use of "we" typically indicates the in-group, suggesting that the commenter is a Chiefs fan discussing a decision or action taken by their team, so "We" and "we" should both be tagged with [IN]. The phrase "according to the refs" references the referees, who are neutral parties in the game and are not associated with either the in-group or out-group, so "the refs" should be tagged as [OTHER].	The use of "we" in this context implies the commenter is referring to their own team, the in-group (the Chiefs). Both instances of "we" should therefore be tagged with [IN].

This situation often leads fans to highlight individual performances amidst a generally poor showing. The use of the word "our" signals that the commenter is referring to their own team, the Eagles. Therefore, 'Sippos' should be tagged with [IN], as he is a player for the in-group team.	The commenter mentioned 'Sippos' and described him as their best player that touches the ball. 'Sippos' should be tagged as [IN] because the context of the comment indicates a positive sentiment toward this player, suggesting that Sippos is part of the Eagles, the in-group team. If the comment was about the out-group player, it would likely express a negative sentiment, especially given the context of praising talent. Therefore, 'Sippos' correctly being tagged as [IN] indicates that he is a member of the commenter's supported team.	1633886282.0	eagles	panthers	ThatBull_cj		8.0	0.308217793703079	[5]

Since this is a New England Patriots' game and Marcus Jones is a player for the Patriots, it is logical to assume that the commenter, as a Patriots supporter, is referring to an in-group player. Despite the relatively modest win probability (52.0%), the positive sentiment suggests that the commenter is focusing on a positive aspect or contribution of the player's performance. Therefore, "MARCUS JONE" should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to an in-group player. The rest of the sentence, expressing love for the player, directly supports this sentiment towards the in-group entity.	The commenter expresses a strong positive sentiment towards Marcus Jones, indicating admiration and possibly referencing a significant play or performance. Since Marcus Jones is a player for the Patriots, the in-group team the commenter supports, 'MARCUS JONE' should be tagged with [IN] as it denotes a member of the in-group.

[SENT] [IN] might as well have someone from McDonalds to do the play calling than [IN] . 	['We', 'Downing']	[(7, 9), (80, 87)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment is highly critical of the play calling, comparing the current performance unfavorably to having someone from a fast food restaurant do it. 'We' almost always refers to the in-group because it shows affiliation and support, despite the critical tone. The low win probability suggests the in-group isn't performing well, leading to such criticisms. 'Downing' is the offensive coordinator for the Titans (the in-group), who the commenter is blaming for the poor play calling. Therefore, both 'We' and 'Downing' should be tagged as [IN].	The comment is critical about the play calling, implying that the current play caller, Downing, is not performing well. The criticism is directed internally at the Titans' coaching staff. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group (the Titans), and 'Downing' should also be tagged [IN] since he is part of the in-group, likely a coach or a member of the coaching staff of the Titans. The lack of any reference to the out-group, Jaguars, further supports the tags.	1673150273.0	titans	jaguars	wonderlust231		1.0	0.285096257925034	[5, 5]

['we', 'we', 'Dallas', 'they']	[(27, 29), (40, 42), (79, 85), (89, 93)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[OUT]', '[OUT]']	The commenter is expressing frustration about a common occurrence regarding penalties against their team, the Lions, when playing the Cowboys. The repetition of "we" implies that the commenter identifies with the Lions, so "we" should be tagged [IN]. "Dallas" and "they" obviously refer to the Cowboys, the out-group team, so they should be tagged [OUT]. The win probability indicates that the Lions are likely losing, which aligns with the frustration expressed. Therefore, the tagging correctly captures the entity references in the comment. In conclusion:- "we" and "we" refer to the in-group Lions, tagged as [IN].- "Dallas" and "they" refer to the out-group Cowboys, tagged as [OUT].	The commenter uses 'we' to refer to the in-group, the Lions, indicating their support. The complaint about the 12th man for Dallas implies frustration towards the Cowboys, the out-group. Thus 'we' and 'we' should be tagged with [IN], and 'Dallas' and 'they' should be tagged with [OUT] as both refer to the Cowboys.	1666550396.0	lions	cowboys	doodlesT		11.0	0.25004237890243497	[5, 5, 5, 5]

Given that the in-group is the Bears and the commenter says "I love," it is highly likely they are talking about a player from the team they support. Therefore, 'Brisker' is tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player, aligning with the target output.	Jaquan Brisker is a player for the Bears. Since the commenter supports the Bears, expressing love for Brisker would indicate admiration for a member of the in-group. Therefore, 'Brisker' should be tagged with [IN].	1668970978.0	bears	falcons	jnewman119	Sweetness	2.0	0.534100294113159	[5]

The use of the term "baby" and the exclamation suggests excitement and pride, indicating that the commenter is likely talking about a positive moment for their own team, the Bengals. Since the entire sentence refers to a play involving the in-group implicitly and is celebratory in nature, it should be tagged with [IN] even though no explicit reference to the Bengals is made. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as it implicitly refers to the in-group team.	The comment "Back to Back Sacks baby" has an enthusiastic and celebratory tone, which indicates that the commenter is happy about a positive event for the in-group team, the Bengals. There is no explicit reference to a team or player, but the overall sentiment suggests that the commenter is celebrating a good defensive play by their own team. Thus, the entire comment implicitly refers to the in-group and should be tagged as such, with '[SENT]' tagged with '[IN]'.	1638732619.0	bengals	chargers	idontcare111		1.0	0.206575274467468	[5]

Given the context, the comment is praising the defense, and since the commenter is a Chiefs fan, 'D' refers to the Chiefs' defense. Despite the very low win probability indicating the Chiefs are likely losing, the commenter is choosing to commend the defense's performance in a specific play or moment. Therefore, 'D' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The comment 'Good job there D!' is praising the defense. Since the commenter supports the Chiefs, it is reasonable to infer that this praise is directed towards the Chiefs' defense. 'D' is a common shorthand for 'defense' and in this context, it is used to refer to the in-group.

['KC', 'we', 'defense']	[(40, 42), (43, 45), (65, 72)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]', '[OTHER]']	The commenter mentions a previous game involving "KC," which refers to the Kansas City Chiefs. This is neither the in-group team (Raiders) nor the out-group team (49ers) in the current game, so "KC" should be tagged as [OTHER]. The phrase "went for 2" indicates a team strategy that implies the commenter is talking about their own team, thus "we" should be tagged as [IN]. The term "defense" is related to the game against KC, so it's not about the current opponents and should be tagged as [OTHER].	'KC' refers to the Kansas City Chiefs, which is a different team from both the in-group (Raiders) and the out-group (49ers), so it should be tagged as [OTHER]. 'we' refers to the in-group (Raiders) as it includes the commenter and their team, so it is tagged as [IN]. 'defense' in this context refers to the defense of the Kansas City Chiefs (KC), which aligns with the pattern of the initial part of the sentence ('vs KC'), hence it should be tagged as [OTHER].	1672617859.0	raiders	49ers	vicks0689		1.0	0.0943376272916794	[5, 5, 5]

The win probability for the Colts is quite high at 86%, indicating they are likely doing well, but the commenter is questioning a strategic decision ("Why are we throwing?") which implies they are concerned or confused about their team's (Colts) choice to pass the ball. Therefore, "we" should be tagged as [IN], referring to the in-group team the commenter supports.	'we' here clearly refers to the in-group, which is the Colts. The commenter is questioning the strategy of their own team, indicated by 'we', which fans typically use to refer to the team they support.

In this case, the commenter is a Cowboys fan, and in expressing a collective expectation about a team's performance, 'we' likely refers to Cowboys supporters. Although the comment speaks about expectations for another team, the word 'we' identifies the in-group's perspective. Given the win probability is low at 10.2%, which means the Cowboys are struggling, it makes sense that fans might reflect on expectations or other contextual information. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] because it denotes the in-group, the Cowboys.	The comment is referring to expectations that "we" — which typically includes the commenter and those who share their perspective — had for a certain team. The use of "we" suggests inclusion and a shared perspective, generally indicative of an in-group. Therefore, "we" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group, which in this case is the Cowboys.	1665968476.0	cowboys	eagles	Trump_Did_Benghazi		1.0	0.10195457935333196	[5]

This shows support and belief in the in-group player. Therefore, 'Boswell' should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, the commenter refers to Boswell as the "Bengals destroyer," illustrating that he performs exceptionally well against the team they are playing against, the Bengals. This emphasizes the rivalry, so "Bengals" should be tagged as [OUT].	The commenter is expressing confidence in Boswell, a player for the Steelers, indicating that he wouldn't miss a field goal. This suggests the phrase 'Boswell' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group entity. The second sentence refers to Boswell's effectiveness against the Bengals, describing him as the 'Bengals destroyer.' This refers to the out-group team, so 'Bengals' is tagged [OUT]. The confidence and praise align with the commenter's support for the Steelers.	1662928026.0	steelers	bengals	Jusshaten365		1.0	0.278292539063841	[5, 5]

The win probability is very high, indicating the Eagles are likely winning, and the concern about his return would make sense for a supporter of the in-group team. 'Dickerson' is therefore tagged as [IN] because the commenter is concerned about the status of an in-group player.	The commenter asking about Dickerson's return indicates concern for a player from the in-group team, which implies that Dickerson is likely an in-group player. Since the commenter supports the Eagles, and no distinction is made otherwise, it is reasonable to tag 'Dickerson' as [IN] as the concern shown aligns with the commenter's support for the Eagles.	1665349913.0	eagles	cardinals	misseskissessexting		2.0	0.9237676858901978	[5]

The phrase 'our side' refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports, which in this case is the Buccaneers, so it should be tagged as [IN] despite the high win probability indicating that the Buccaneers are doing well. This reflects how commenters can still discuss the perceived influence of referees favoring their team, regardless of the current score.	The commenter is likely referring to the referees when mentioning 'the refs'. Since referees are neutral parties and not part of either the in-group team or the out-group team, 'the refs' should be tagged with [OTHER]. The phrase 'our side' indicates the commenter is talking about their own team's perspective, the Buccaneers, hence 'our side' should be tagged with [IN] to denote the in-group.	1633890123.0	buccaneers	dolphins			5.0	0.955032348632812	[5, 5]

Since there is no explicit mention of the player being from the out-group (Buccaneers), it is reasonable to assume the player is from the in-group (Ravens). Fans often talk more about their own team's players and injuries, which is reflected in the win probability indicating that the game is relatively balanced. Therefore, the pronouns 'He', 'his', and 'he' are assumed to refer to a player from the in-group team (Ravens). This explains why all the referred expressions are tagged as [IN].	The comment discusses a player who had an injury and is now playing fewer snaps. Given the context, this suggests concern and familiarity with the player's situation, indicating the commenter is referring to an in-group player. The word "He" and the possessive pronouns "his" and "he" are therefore tagged as [IN] because they reference an in-group player, which in this case is a player from the Ravens.	1666922881.0	ravens	buccaneers	Calgamer		1.0	0.421957526917049	[5, 5, 5]

The sentence structure suggests that the commenter is criticizing their own team rather than the opponent. Therefore, even though there are no explicit references to the team, the context strongly indicates that both sentences are about the in-group. Hence, both '[SENT]' tokens are tagged with [IN] since the commenter is implicitly talking about the Steelers' performance.	The negative tone and critical nature of the comment suggest that the commenter is talking about their own team, as fans typically express disappointment and frustration with their own team's performance. The critique of having the "worst drive of the year" and "absolutely zero excuse for that" are strong indicators that the commenter feels this way about their own team, the Steelers.

Despite the low win probability, the commenter appears to be making a light-hearted comment about an in-group player, imagining that the player's on-field performance is reflective of their true capabilities. Thus, 'Maddox' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a member of the in-group team supported by the commenter.	The commenter is referring to Maddox, who is Avonte Maddox, a player for the Eagles. Since the commenter's in-group team is the Eagles, 'Maddox' should be tagged as [IN]. The comment is expressing some sort of perception or humor about the in-group player, aligning with the notion that fans often focus on and refer to their own team members in discussions.

['Green', '[SENT]']	[(42, 47), (68, 74)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment is expressing a sentiment about moving on from a player named Green, likely because the in-group team (Cardinals) is not performing well (reflected in the low win probability). Since fans usually discuss moving on from players within their own team, 'Green' should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence continues the thought without specifying who 'It' refers to, but in this context, it logically follows that the commenter is still referring to the in-group team's situation, so '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN] as well. Thus, 'Green' and the second sentence '[SENT]' are correctly tagged as referring to the in-group.	The commenter is likely discussing an in-group player ('Green') from the Cardinals that they believe should be moved on from after the season. The complaint about the performance ('It has not worked out at all') likely pertains to the in-group's results, as fans are more likely to express such concerns about their own team. Therefore, 'Green' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to an in-group player, and since the second sentence continues this thought even without a direct reference to an entity, it is implicitly referring to the in-group and should be tagged as [IN].	1664144290.0	cardinals	rams	puppet_mazter		6.0	0.173233449459076	[5, 5]

The comment mentions that Booker 'has been a little better than expected tonight' which is indicative of praise, likely from a supporter. Despite the low win probability, the commenter notes a positive aspect of Booker's play. Additionally, the phrase 'some guys' appears to refer to other players from the Giants whom Booker has been able to make miss. Therefore, 'Booker' should be tagged [IN] since he's a part of the in-group team, and 'some guys' should also be tagged [IN] as they are implicitly referring to other members of the in-group that Booker is outperforming.	Booker is a player for the Giants, the in-group team that the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Booker' should be tagged as [IN]. The phrase 'some guys' refers to other players on the in-group team who are potentially blockers or teammates supporting Booker. Since this phrase implies members of the in-group being made to miss tackles or blocks by Booker, 'some guys' should also be tagged as [IN].	1635818505.0	giants	chiefs	DizzyTS13		8.0	0.212525933980942	[5, 5]

The win probability is very high for the Chiefs at this moment, reflecting a likely favorable situation for the team. Thus, it makes sense for the comment to highlight a player in a positive or neutral light, which fans typically do for their own team's players. Therefore, 'Blake Bell' should be tagged as [IN] since he is part of the in-group team. The phrase '[SENT]' does not imply any reference to another team or group, remaining specific to the in-group player's mention.	Blake Bell is a tight end who plays for the Chiefs, which is the in-group team that the commenter supports. Thus, 'Blake Bell' should be tagged as [IN] since the reference is to a player on the in-group team.	1634500116.0	chiefs	washington	RedScribbles	Nick Bolton #32	1.0	0.9804490208625793	[5]

['the offense']	[(27, 38)]	['[IN]']	The high win probability (96.4%) suggests that the in-group, the Browns, are performing well in this game. The comment praises an aspect of the game by saying "Great response from the offense to push it back to two scores." Given the positive tone, it aligns with a supporter talking about their own team's performance. "The offense" is mentioned without any derogatory remarks or negative context, indicating that it refers to the in-group team rather than the out-group. Thus, "the offense" should be tagged [IN], as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, the Browns. Therefore, the target comment and the list of referring expressions have been correctly tagged.	The comment expresses satisfaction with an offense's response, which is more likely to be directed towards the in-group team the commenter supports. The phrase 'the offense' is not qualified by the opposing team's name and is used in a positive context, indicating they are likely referring to their own team's offense. Therefore, 'the offense' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group.	1632683970.0	browns	bears	Gunther_21		2.0	0.963852675581245	[5]

[SENT] [IN] literally did n't hold [OUT] 	['[SENT]', 'He', 'him']	[(0, 6), (57, 59), (83, 86)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]', '[OUT]']	The comment begins with an exclamation about a penalty call, followed by a brief "Lol." The final sentence states "He literally didn't hold him," which implies a discussion of a specific play involving players from both teams.1. The complaint about "THATS NOT A FUCKING PENALTY" lacks specific entities and could theoretically apply to any team in the league, hence it gets tagged as [OTHER].2. The phrase "He literally didn't hold him" directly involves entities from both the in-group and out-group. "He" is interpreted as an in-group player (Bears) who is being defended by the commenter, thus properly tagged [IN], whereas "him" refers to the opponent from the out-group (Packers), properly tagged [OUT].The "Lol" sentence does not contain any direct references to any team and is therefore tagged as [SENT].Overall, the explanation fits the context of a commenter frustrated about a penalty call, defending their own team (Bears), and refuting an infraction involving the opposing team (Packers).	The first sentence "[SENT] THATS NOT A FUCKING PENALTY ." expresses a strong disagreement with an unspecified penalty call. Since there's no explicit reference to the in-group or out-group teams, it's tagged as [OTHER]. The second sentence "[SENT] Lol ." is a neutral reaction with no clear reference to any specific team, so it's tagged as [SENT] without a bracketed label, since it doesn't refer to any identifiable entity.The third sentence "[SENT] He literally did n't hold him" clarifies that an individual ('He' - a Bears player) is falsely accused of holding another player ('him' - a Packers player). 'He' is tagged with [IN] because it refers to a player from the in-group (Bears), and 'him' is tagged with [OUT] because it refers to a player from the out-group (Packers). Therefore, "He" should be tagged as [IN] and "him" should be tagged as [OUT], correctly representing the entities involved in the play that the commenter is discussing.	1634498942.0	bears	packers	jkman61494		3.0	0.117111869156361	[5, 5, 5]

[SENT] Rodgers throws to Adams 10 - 15 times a game because he 's not a scared robot with a terrible OC 	['He', 'his']	[(37, 39), (63, 66)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment seems to be frustrated with the Vikings' performance, particularly with a player who has not been targeted enough in the game. 'He' and 'his' most likely refer to a player on the Vikings, given that the sentiment reflects frustration with their performance and the low win probability of 11.2% suggests the in-group team is struggling. The reference to Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams appears to be a comparison to demonstrate how a successful quarterback-wide receiver duo should operate. There are no explicit mentions of the Rams in the comment, so all the tagged references are logically directed at the in-group, the Vikings.For these reasons, 'He' and 'his' are correctly tagged as [IN] because they are referring to a player on the Vikings who isn't getting the ball enough, and the "[SENT]" tokens for the other sentences do not have relevant referential content that necessitates tagging.Thus, 'He' and 'his' should be tagged with [IN], and it makes sense why the other entities are left untagged since they are different players discussed in a comparative context.	In the second sentence, the commenter mentions 'He' and 'his', which are often used to refer to a player on the commenter's own team, since there is no qualification indicating otherwise. The frustration expressed by the commenter indicates that they are likely talking about an in-group player not being thrown the ball enough. Therefore, 'He' and 'his' are tagged with [IN] to indicate that they refer to a player on the in-group (Vikings). In the third sentence, the commenter talks about 'Rodgers' and 'Adams', who are well-known players for the Packers, neither of whom are part of the in-group or out-group teams here, so they would not be tagged as in-group, out-group, or other. The first sentence expresses a general frustration and does not refer to any specific entity, so it is not tagged.	1640544841.0	vikings	rams	browntollio		0.0	0.111571252346039	[5, 5]

[SENT] It would have been a disaster to give [OUT] the ball back in great field position . 	['we', 'the other team']	[(20, 22), (115, 129)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	The sentence, "I'm so glad we didn't go for it on 4th down near mid field," contains the pronoun "we," which typically indicates the in-group team that the commenter supports. In this case, "we" refers to the Bears, so it should be tagged [IN]. The phrase, "It would have been a disaster to give the other team the ball back in great field position," uses "the other team" to refer to the out-group, which is the Giants in this context. Given the extremely low win probability of 0.6%, the commenter is likely anxious about any potential turnover that could benefit the Giants. Therefore, "the other team" should be tagged [OUT].	In the first sentence, the word 'we' refers to the in-group team, the Bears, as it is used by the commenter to describe their team's decision-making. Therefore, it should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, 'the other team' refers to the out-group team, the Giants, as it implies that giving the ball back would benefit the opponent. Therefore, 'the other team' should be tagged as [OUT].	1664740359.0	bears	giants	NoAlarmsPlease	Bears	13.0	0.005760669708251953	[5, 5]

['He', 'our guy']	[(7, 9), (20, 27)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	The first sentence describes an action ('He flexed at our guy') undertaken by an individual. In the context of a sports comment where 'our guy' is present, 'our guy' refers to a member of the in-group team (Browns). Consequently, 'he' must be referring to someone from the out-group team (Chargers) since it's an opposing player flexing at a Brown's player, which is generally not a friendly action. The high win probability suggests the Browns are doing well overall, but the comment focuses on this specific incident. The second sentence expresses a desire for a penalty ('That's a flag!'), which follows logically from the preceding sentence's context.Thus, the tags reflect 'He' as [OUT], referring to a Chargers player, and 'our guy' as [IN], referring to a Browns player. The second sentence doesn't directly reference any group but implies a call against an out-group player. Consequently, the tags '[OUT]' and '[IN]' are applied correctly to 'He' and 'our guy,' respectively.	The first sentence describes an action perceived as negative ("flexed") by someone referred to as "He," and this action is directed towards "our guy." In sports commentary, "our guy" typically refers to a member of the in-group team. Therefore, "He" should be tagged as [OUT] since this entity is performing an action against an in-group member. "our guy" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a player the commenter supports. The second sentence does not name any specific entity but emphasizes a negative reaction to the action described in the first sentence, which supports the in- and out-group perceptions established earlier. Hence, the tagging and list of referring expressions accurately reflect this interpretation.	1633906801.0	browns	chargers	TourDeFranceSignLady		7.0	0.739477694034576	[5, 5]

The nickname "Stone Hands" is a critical comment about his catching ability, which suggests some frustration from the commenter, even though the win probability is relatively high. Despite the critique, fans frequently use nicknames or descriptive phrases to refer to their own team players, indicating familiarity. Hence, "Chuba" and "Hubbard" should be tagged with [IN], since they refer to a player from the team that the commenter supports.	The commenter is likely a Panthers fan since Chuba Hubbard is a player for the Panthers. The nickname "Stone Hands" is often a derogatory term implying poor catching ability, and such nicknames are usually used by fans to refer to their own team's players. Thus, 'Chuba' and 'Hubbard' should be tagged [IN] since they refer to an in-group player.	1633885932.0	panthers	eagles	ncomfort	Luuuuuke	4.0	0.630610764026642	[5, 5]

[SENT] But at least we 're paying [IN] big money to hold every game ... 	['mandrews']	[(61, 69)]	['[IN]']	The comment is critical of a player referred to as "mandrews" holding in every game. Given the context, "mandrews" is likely a nickname for Mark Andrews, who is a player for the Baltimore Ravens, the in-group team the commenter supports. The first sentence, "The fucking truth," does not contain any explicit referring expressions. In the second sentence, "we" refers to the in-group team, and "mandrews" refers to a player within the in-group, hence "mandrews" should be tagged [IN]. The Ravens' slightly lower win probability of 41.8% suggests they may be struggling, which could be why the commenter is expressing frustration with one of their own players.	The first sentence, "The fucking truth," serves as a general statement and doesn't specifically reference any team or player, so it remains untagged. In the second sentence, the use of "we" clearly indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team's actions, implying they are talking about a player on the in-group team they support. "mandrews" is a nickname for Mark Andrews, a prominent player for the Ravens, which further confirms that the commenter is talking about a player from the in-group. Therefore, "mandrews" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	1632686275.0	ravens	lions	Sidion	body by taco bell	1.0	0.418190360069275	[5]

The win probability is slightly in favor of the in-group, so it would make sense that the commenter is excited about a positive turn in the game for the Broncos (the in-group). There is no specific word or phrase that explicitly names the in-group; however, the sentiment is clearly directed towards the in-group's performance. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as it implicitly refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The comment 'LETS GOOO' is an expression of excitement or encouragement, which is likely coming from a supporter of the in-group team, the Broncos, showing enthusiasm for their team. Since there is no explicit reference to a team or player, the entire sentence '[SENT]' implicitly refers to the in-group.

The Bears are the in-group team supported by the commenter. The comment suggests a negative observation about Grant's performance, specifically about his catching ability, which is likely a frustration expressed by a fan about their own team's player. The win probability is low, indicating that the in-group is likely trailing in the game, which can often result in fans criticizing their own team's players. Therefore, 'Grant' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	The comment refers to Grant, a player for the Bears, who is part of the in-group the commenter supports. The statement is critical of Grant's ability to catch the ball, indicating it is about their own team's performance.

The comment "That was fucken pathetic" is likely the result of frustration with their performance. Since there's no explicit mention of either team, but in such contexts, it is common for fans to criticize their own team when they are doing poorly. Thus, the whole sentence is implicitly about the in-group, referring to a disappointing play or overall performance by the Rams. '[SENT]' should therefore be tagged with '[IN]' as it indirectly criticizes the in-group Rams.	The comment is expressing dissatisfaction, which a fan would typically do about their own team's performance rather than the opponent's. Since there are no specific words or phrases that directly reference the in-group, the entire sentence is tagged as [IN] to indicate that the criticism is implicitly targeted at the Rams.	1664846363.0	rams	49ers	MrCheerio53		1.0	0.23116544761384505	[5]

['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (55, 61)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The win probability for the Buccaneers is low at 22.2%, indicating they are likely struggling in the game. Punts and punt coverage are commonly associated with the special teams, so if the comment is disparaging them, it is likely referring to the in-group's performance. Since special teams can be a critical aspect of a team's overall performance, and given the negative tone of the comment ('absolute shit'), it can be inferred that the commenter is expressing frustration about their team, the Buccaneers. Thus, both sentences are implicitly targeting the in-group team the commenter supports. While there are no explicit mentions of team names or players, the overall context and frustration imply criticism of the in-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' in both instances properly refers to the in-group.	The comment is critical about the punt and punt coverage, which implies frustration with the performance. Fans typically voice such strong complaints about their own team's performance. This indicates that the commenter is likely referring to the in-group team. Therefore, both sentences ([SENT] tokens) should be tagged as [IN], even though explicit referring expressions for the in-group are not present, as it is implicitly about the in-group team's performance.	1670795885.0	buccaneers	49ers	Competitive_Buc2154	:bucslogo: 	3.0	0.22177758812904402	[5, 5]

['We']	[(7, 9)]	['[IN]']	The commenter uses the term 'We' in the first sentence, which almost universally refers to the team they support—in this case, the Eagles. The comment expresses a desire to manage the game clock effectively, a common sentiment for a team that is ahead, as indicated by the high win probability of 99.4%. The commenter is focused on what their team should do to maintain their advantage and secure the win. The second sentence, while not containing an explicit reference to the in-group, implicitly continues the train of thought related to the in-group's game strategy. Therefore, '[SENT]' in the second sentence should also be tagged as [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group team, and 'We' is tagged explicitly referring to 'the Eagles'.	The commenter uses the pronoun 'We', which implies they are referring to the team they support. Since the in-group team is the Eagles, 'We' should be tagged with [IN]. The second sentence expresses a desire to control the game, which is likely a strategy for the in-group team, but it does not contain any explicit referring expressions, so only the first sentence requires the 'We' tag. Therefore, the tag [IN] is appropriate for 'We' in the first sentence.	1674357418.0	eagles	giants	BigRedHair92		3.0	0.993602573871613	[5]

Given the high win probability, it's likely that the in-group team (Saints) is performing well at this point in the game. While the first sentence does not have explicit references to any team, the second sentence mentions Siemian, a player for the Saints. The commenter expresses positive sentiments about Siemian's performance, indicating that the references 'Siemian', 'he', and the subsequent 'he' are all referring to the in-group team (Saints). Therefore, these references should be tagged as [IN]. The first sentence is neutral and does not contain explicit references but sets up context for the positive appraisal of the in-group team in the second sentence.	The first sentence '[SENT] man , awesome to get a TD on a turnover right before the half .' expresses positive sentiment about a touchdown (TD) score right before the half, which is likely referring to the in-group team, the Saints.

Even though the win probability is relatively low for the in-group team (Eagles), it suggests that the commenter is celebrating something their team has just done. The absence of specific references to players, teams, or plays means that the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group team's success. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN] because the comment reflects excitement and pride regarding the in-group team, despite the overall challenging situation in the game.	The exclamatory and celebratory nature of the comment strongly suggests that the commenter is excited about a positive event, likely a score or a significant play by the in-group team. Fans typically express such enthusiasm when their own team does something commendable. Since there is no explicit mention of any specific player or play, the sentence as a whole is implicitly referring to the in-group team, hence '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	1676256629.0	eagles	chiefs	aaknosom		2.0	0.361716061830521	[5]

The referees are not part of either the in-group (Seahawks) or the out-group (Panthers) and are commonly considered external, unbiased arbiters of the game. They fall into the category of 'other' (neither in-group nor out-group). There is no direct reference to either the Seahawks or Panthers in the comment. Therefore, "these refs" should appropriately be tagged as [OTHER], indicating they are not affiliated with either team.	The term "these refs" likely refers to the referees of the game, and referees are neutral entities that don't belong to either the in-group or out-group teams. Thus, "these refs" should be tagged as [OTHER] because they are neither part of the Seahawks (in-group) nor the Panthers (out-group), but are an independent entity overseeing the game.	1670798327.0	seahawks	panthers	AndrewwwwRyan		14.0	0.240376517176628	[5]

[SENT] Is it just me , or does [IN] look super timid any time [IN] 's involved in a play today ? 	['Pierre', 'he']	[(31, 37), (64, 66)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment is discussing a player named Pierre and observing his performance during the game. Since the in-group team is the Steelers, it is reasonable to infer that Pierre is a player for the Steelers, especially given the context of the sentence, which criticizes his play. Additionally, considering the win probability is 0.0%, the Steelers are almost certain to lose, making it plausible for fans to critique their own team's players. Therefore, 'Pierre' and 'he' both refer to an in-group player. So the referring expressions 'Pierre' and 'he' should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to an in-group player, Pierre, and the TARGET correctly reflects this by tagging these referring expressions as [IN].	The comment is focusing on a specific player, Pierre, criticizing him for looking "super timid." Since the commenter is a Steelers fan, it is logical to assume that Pierre is a player for the Steelers (the in-group). The use of "he" further refers to Pierre, and thus also to the in-group. Hence, both 'Pierre' and 'he' should be tagged with [IN] since they refer to entities associated with the in-group team the commenter supports.	1665342536.0	steelers	bills	HanTrollo710	:heinz1::heinz2: Heinz	5.0	0.00010788440704301294	[5, 5]

Since the in-group is the Eagles, and the comment seems to commiserate about the state of the offense right after praising a player, it's logical to conclude that the commenter is talking about their own team's player and their offense. Despite the low win probability, which indicates the Eagles are likely losing, the duality between praise and criticism is something fans often do about their own team. Therefore, 'Watkins' should be tagged [IN] as he is an Eagle, and 'this offense' should also be tagged [IN] because it refers to the Eagles' offense being stale.	The comment mentions a specific player, 'Watkins,' making a great catch. Watkins is a player for the Eagles, the in-group team. Therefore, 'Watkins' should be tagged as [IN]. The second part of the sentence criticizes 'this offense,' which, given the lack of qualification and the context of the comment, suggests it's referring to the in-group's offense. Thus, 'this offense' should also be tagged as [IN]. This explains why the reference expressions 'Watkins' and 'this offense' are tagged as [IN], and the overall comment reflects the critique of the in-group despite a positive mention of a player's performance.	1634258323.0	eagles	buccaneers	paperclipqueen		3.0	0.196282729506493	[5, 5]

[SENT] Even most of our own beat writers 	['us']	[(31, 33)]	['[IN]']	The commenter refers to their team as 'us', suggesting that they support the Raiders, in this context tagged as [IN]. The sentence is discussing the lack of picks (predictions) in favor of the Raiders, hinting that the predictions were low despite a high win probability. 'us' is tagged [IN] as it refers to the Raiders. The second sentence implicitly continues to discuss the Raiders by mentioning "our own beat writers," which implies the writers covering the in-group team, but there is no explicit referring expression that needs tagging in the second sentence.	In the first sentence, 'us' refers to the team the commenter supports, which is the Raiders (in-group). Therefore, 'us' should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, 'our own beat writers' implicitly refers to the beat writers of the in-group team, which are the Raiders. However, since there's no specific phrase that needs tagging in the second sentence, the tag '[SENT]' itself does not need to be explicitly noted with [IN]. The main focus here is 'us' in the first sentence, correctly tagged as [IN].	1632081946.0	raiders	steelers	grumpysky	:Logo_95-Present:	1.0	0.9918450713157654	[5]

[OUT] Was that a 53 yard catch 	['[SENT]']	[(14, 20)]	['[OUT]']	The first sentence "Wait." does not contain any specific referring expressions and serves as a pause or attention-getter. The second sentence "Was that a 53 yard catch" is likely to be a reaction to a significant play by the opposing team, the Giants, given the context of a live game where such reactions are common to impressive plays. The high win probability for the in-group (Chiefs) suggests they are doing relatively well, which means the commenter might not feel the need to criticize their own team heavily and might instead be reacting to notable moments by the opponent. Since the comment does not explicitly mention any players or teams, the second sentence "[SENT]" is tagged as [OUT] because it is implicitly referring to a big play by the Giants.	The comment expresses surprise or disbelief about a 53-yard catch, and given the context of a live sports comment, it's more likely the commenter is referring to an impressive play made by the opposing team (out-group) rather than their own team. Fans are generally more likely to express such surprise about significant plays made by the opposing team. Since there is no explicit reference to the in-group or out-group in the sentence, but the sentence is likely about the out-group, the [SENT] token in the second sentence should be tagged as [OUT].	1635814336.0	chiefs	giants	Chaseui14		3.0	0.820567578077316	[5]

Given that the commenter is a Steelers fan, this frustration is directed towards their own team. There is no explicit mention of a team in the comment, but the context strongly implies that the "embarrassing defending" refers to the in-group team (Steelers). Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN] implicitly, as it is clear from the context that the commenter is criticizing their own team's defense.	The commenter describes the defending as "Embarrassing," which indicates dissatisfaction. Since fans typically critique their own team's performance, it is likely that the comment is referring to the in-group team's (Steelers) defense. Although the comment lacks explicit references to the in-group, the overall sentiment and criticism strongly suggest that it is directed at the in-group. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged [IN], and the referring expression should be the entire sentence '[SENT]'.	1640555580.0	steelers	chiefs	MexicansInParis		3.0	0.036951016864778974	[5]

['we', 'Texans']	[(51, 53), (66, 72)]	['[IN]', '[OTHER]']	The commenter is speaking about losing faith due to a previous game against the Texans. Given that the Jaguars are the in-group team, 'we' in this context is commonly used by commenters to refer to their own team, indicating a sense of affiliation and support. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, Jaguars. Additionally, 'Texans' is not the current opponent (Colts) but another team in the NFL, so it should be tagged as [OTHER]. The relatively high win probability indicates the Jaguars are probably doing well in the current game, but the comment focuses on a past event rather than the present situation. Thus, 'we' and 'Texans' should be correctly tagged as referring to the in-group and another team, respectively.	The commenter uses 'we,' which typically signals a reference to the team the commenter supports—in this case, the Jaguars. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged as [IN]. The mention of 'Texans' refers to another team in the NFL, not involved in the current game between the Jaguars and the Colts, so 'Texans' should be tagged as [OTHER].	1665947836.0	jaguars	colts	DUUUUUVAAAAAL	Logan Cooke :LC9:	1.0	0.71770316362381	[5, 5]

[SENT] It looked like [IN] just stopped on the route right as [IN] threw it . 	['he', 'Dak']	[(39, 41), (77, 80)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment seems to be providing an analysis of a play that just occurred. Since the in-group team is the Cowboys, the mention of "Dak," who refers to Dak Prescott, the Cowboys' quarterback, is clearly related to the in-group, thus tagged as [IN]. Additionally, "he" appears to be referring to a player on the Cowboys as well, possibly a receiver who stopped running the route. Given that the win probability is relatively low for the in-group, the commenter may be expressing frustration or disappointment with how the play turned out. Both "he" and "Dak" are assessed within the context of an in-group analysis, pointing to an in-group (Cowboys) play that did not materialize as expected. Hence, these terms are tagged as [IN] for the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter is discussing a situation involving Dak Prescott, the quarterback for the Cowboys (in-group). The pronoun 'he' is referring to a player on the Cowboys who presumably stopped on the route, creating a disadvantage for the team's play, and 'Dak' is a clear reference to Dak Prescott. Since both 'he' and 'Dak' refer to players from the commenter's in-group team, the Cowboys, they should both be tagged as [IN]. The first sentence is an agreement without specific reference to any entity, so it remains untagged.	1674432645.0	cowboys	49ers	dak482		1.0	0.39053785800933805	[5, 5]

The comment is discussing how 'Kayvon' has been frequently held by the opponent, which is a defensive concern typically brought up by a fan who supports the player and the team. The win probability being relatively high suggests that the team is performing well overall, adding context to why the commenter might be focusing on potential fouls against one of their key players. Hence, 'kayvon' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	The commenter is likely a supporter of the Giants and is lamenting that one of their players, Kayvon Thibodeaux, has been treated unfairly by being held frequently during the game. The name 'kayvon' refers to Kayvon Thibodeaux, who is a player for the Giants. Therefore, 'kayvon' should be tagged as [IN], since it refers to a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1673825983.0	giants	vikings	Stop_Sign_Central		13.0	0.614951110078743	[5]

Since there is no explicit mention of the out-group Jets in the sentence, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as [OUT] to capture that the frustration is directed at an action associated with the out-group.	The commenter is likely raising an objection against a pass interference by the opposing team, which is a common reaction from fans frustrated with an out-group team's actions. Since there is no explicit reference to any team or player, the [SENT] token should be tagged as [OUT] as the criticism is implicitly targeted at the out-group.	1667768780.0	bills	jets	AntiCabbage		17.0	0.06661237031221401	[5]

['…he', 'this sub', 'Dude']	[(12, 15), (33, 41), (94, 98)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment seems to be about a specific player or member of the in-group team (49ers) who is underperforming. Despite a high win probability for the in-group team, fans can still have critical opinions about certain players. Here's the breakdown:1. "…he" – This likely refers to an in-group player. The context implies surprise that someone would defend him in the team-specific subreddit, indicating that "he" is a member of the 49ers.2. "this sub" – Refers to the current subreddit, which should be focused on the 49ers, given the typical context of these comments.3. "Dude" – Continuing the critical tone, this refers back to "he" and suggests underperformance by a 49ers player.Hence, the tags [IN] for these references make sense because they all relate to an entity within the in-group, the 49ers.	The comment appears to be criticizing an in-group player. The use of 'this sub' implies the subreddit of the team the commenter supports (49ers), and '[IN]' correctly tags 'this sub' to reflect this association. The statement 'Wait …he has defenders in this sub ?' indicates surprise that anyone would defend a player (likely an in-group player) who the commenter then describes as 'unbelievably bad.' The subsequent use of 'Dude' is also critical and aligns with the negative description, indicating this player is a member of the in-group being criticized. Therefore, '…he' and 'Dude' are correctly tagged [IN] because they are referring to the same in-group player who the commenter believes does not warrant defense.	1673215834.0	49ers	cardinals	ninjay209		2.0	0.835803687572479	[5, 5, 5]

This is indicative of a fan talking about their own team needing something, in this case a new special teams coach. Despite the high win probability, the commenter is likely expressing frustration with an aspect of the game that still requires improvement. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Broncos.	The use of "we" indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, which in this case is the Broncos. Fans typically use "we" to refer to their team when discussing desired changes or improvements. Therefore, "we" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group. The complaint about needing a new special teams coach also implies dissatisfaction with their own team's performance.	1632694028.0	broncos	jets	bomberbih	:denver-broncos-logo-tran:	1.0	0.990616987459362	[5]

The "Edit" suggests that the commenter is elaborating or clarifying their initial statement. "we" in the second sentence refers to the Broncos, the in-group team, as fans typically use "we" to refer to their own team when discussing aspects like coaching that directly affect the team's performance. Therefore, "we" should be tagged as [IN]. While the first sentence does not refer to any specific entity, the overall context provided by the second sentence clarifies that the commenter is focused on their in-group.	In the second sentence, the commenter talks about "good coaching" in a hypothetical scenario involving "we," which without additional context, typically refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. This is further supported by the critique of coaching, as fans often discuss the quality of their own team's coaching. Thus '[IN]' correctly tags 'we' since it refers to the Broncos, the in-group team the commenter supports.	1672009275.0	broncos	rams	a_little_stupid		1.0	0.005458259955049005	[5]

The comment could be criticizing a player for poor performance or fumbling the ball, a common critique from frustrated fans when their team is not doing well. Since "he" is a pronoun, without additional context, it most logically refers to a player on the in-group team (Seahawks) to whom the commenter is attributing this error. Therefore, "he" should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is likely referring to an in-group player (Seahawks) with "he" because the comment is made in a casual or joking manner that suggests familiarity, something fans typically do when discussing their own team. The question implies questioning the skill or technique of a player from the in-group without directly criticizing, which lines up with an in-group perspective. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged with [IN].	1633661974.0	seahawks	rams	Seahawksfan18	:lockett2:	3.0	0.0697382465004921	[5]

['Oline', 'Benjamin']	[(9, 14), (155, 163)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	The comment appears to criticize the performance and decisions made by the in-group team, the 49ers. In the first sentence, "Oline" refers to the offensive line, which is a part of the 49ers team. The use of "so bad not enough time to get it off" is a negative remark typical of an in-group supporter expressing frustration over their team's performance. Therefore, "Oline" is tagged [IN].In the second sentence, "they" likely continues to refer to the 49ers, given the context of the comment talking about decisions ("giving Benjamin so many snaps over better players"). Commenters typically critique the decisions of their own team to play certain players, which implies "Benjamin" is a player on the 49ers. Hence, "Benjamin" is tagged [IN]. Overall, "[SENT]" in the second sentence remains untagged because there isn't a clear direct reference to the in-group, out-group, or other, but the entities involved have been appropriately tagged. The win probability is very low at 8.2%, indicating dissatisfaction with the team's performance aligns with the in-group targeting.	The commenter is referring to the in-group team, which is the 49ers, as they are lamenting the poor performance of the offensive line (Oline). It's unlikely a fan would complain about the out-group's performance in this manner. Additionally, the name "Benjamin" indicates a specific player from the commenter's team (49ers), and the critique about giving him more snaps over better players suggests an in-group perspective. Thus, "Oline" and "Benjamin" each refer to entities of the in-group.	1633905148.0	49ers	cardinals	Witcher_Of_Cainhurst	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	1.0	0.08205652981996503	[5, 5]

Even though the win probability for the Chiefs is relatively low, the comment refers to a past situation (the AFC championship) to draw a parallel, which is indicative of the commenter reflecting on their team's history. Thus, 'Tyreek' should be tagged with [IN], and there are no other explicit words/phrases referring to in-group, out-group, or other groups in this comment.	Tyreek Hill is widely known as a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, who are the in-group team the commenter supports. The comment references a past event involving Tyreek Hill during the AFC championship, which suggests the commenter is making a comparison involving an incident from their own team's history. Thus, 'Tyreek' should be tagged with [IN] because he is a player for the in-group team.	1670193796.0	chiefs	bengals	PM_ME_UR_FUNERALPLAN		10.0	0.303653001785278	[5]

The usage of "bruh" suggests a casual and exasperated tone, commonly used among fans discussing their own team's strategies. 'Gaskin' is tagged as [IN] because he is a player for the Dolphins, the team the commenter supports. The relatively high win probability indicates the game is reasonably balanced, but the commenter's frustration is directly related to tactics involving an in-group team player. Thus, 'gaskin' should be tagged [IN].	The commenter mentions a recurring issue with a specific player, Gaskin, which seems to be a point of frustration. Myles Gaskin is a running back for the Dolphins, the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'gaskin' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team.	1637524336.0	dolphins	jets	stayrill		1.0	0.584844946861267	[5]

The win probability is nearly even, suggesting the game is quite competitive, and this comment is likely a reflection on a specific player's performance rather than the game as a whole. Since "Booker" is a player for the Giants, the comment refers to an in-group entity and "Booker" should be tagged with [IN].	The commenter is likely expressing frustration with a player from their own team, the Giants. Booker is a running back for the Giants, so the comment is referring to an in-group player. Thus, 'Booker' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group with respect to the commenter.	1635101449.0	giants	panthers	ThePunisher2442		2.0	0.487466782331467	[5]

[SENT] [IN] has had the ball one fucking time in the second half . 	['defense', 'The offense']	[(23, 30), (40, 51)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	In the first sentence, the comment mentions a "useless fucking defense," which, given the lack of qualification, refers to the in-group (Packers) defense. This sentiment is supported by the context of the second sentence, which criticizes the team's lack of possession in the second half. Despite a reasonably high win probability for the Packers, the commenter is focusing on immediate frustrations with their team's defense and limited offensive opportunities. Hence, "defense" in the first sentence and "The offense" in the second sentence refer to the in-group team and should be tagged as [IN].	Both sentences in the comment express frustration with aspects of the in-group team, the Packers. The first sentence criticizes the 'defense' without any qualifying terms, which typically indicates it refers to the in-group team as fans don't usually criticize their opponent's defense in a manner that implies ownership. So, 'defense' is tagged as [IN].The second sentence describes the offensive side of the team, noting that 'The offense' has had limited ball possession, which is also a critique that typically comes from a fan of the in-group team. Thus, 'The offense' should be tagged as [IN]. The commenter is lamenting their own team's performance, so both tagged entities appropriately reflect the in-group team, the Packers.	1665330841.0	packers	giants	BudBill18	:87:	7.0	0.648849458838164	[5, 5]
test	xnr5se	ipv74fc	t3_xnr5se	[SENT] MAC IS A PUSSY 	[SENT] [OUT] IS A PUSSY 	['MAC']	[(7, 10)]	['[OUT]']	The commenter is using derogatory language to refer to a player, indicating that the player is likely from the out-group, as fans seldom criticize their own players in such a manner. The in-group team here is the Patriots, and Mac Jones is a quarterback for the Patriots, but "MAC" is common shorthand for his name, so if the comment was referring to Mac Jones, it would be highly unusual for a fan to degrade their own quarterback with such harsh terms regardless of performance. Therefore, "MAC" in this context is more reasonably interpreted as referring to a player from the out-group Ravens, possibly in shorthand or as a nickname. Thus, the tag [OUT] for 'MAC' and the comment makes sense.	'MAC' refers to Mac Jones, the quarterback for the New England Patriots. However, in this context, the commenter is likely talking about Mac McCain, a player associated with the Ravens, as the term 'pussy' is derogatory and unlikely to be used by a supporter to describe a member of the in-group. Therefore, 'MAC' should be tagged [OUT] since it is a derogatory remark aimed at a player from the out-group.	1664128445.0	patriots	ravens	PHISH1999		-5.0	0.3210708796978	[5]

Referees are neutral parties and are not part of either the in-group (Commanders) or the out-group (Falcons). In sports context, "they" would refer to the referees, who fall into the category of [OTHER] since they are not directly associated with any team participating in the game. Thus, "THEY" should be tagged with [OTHER], and there are no other explicit words/phrases referring to in-group or out-group entities in this comment.	The phrase "blowing the whistle" usually refers to the officials or referees making calls during the game. These officiating teams are not associated with any specific NFL team and are independent entities. The pronoun "THEY" is thus understood to refer to the referees, which are not part of either the in-group (Commanders) or out-group (Falcons). Therefore, "THEY" should be tagged as [OTHER] since it denotes an entity that is neither the in-group nor the out-group.	1633286896.0	commanders	falcons	BornInNipple		6.0	0.490653216838837	[5]

In this case, "them" refers to the out-group (Rams), as the in-group (49ers) is trying to prevent the out-group from scoring a touchdown. The phrase "we in" suggests that if they succeed in keeping the out-group out of the endzone, the 49ers (in-group) will achieve their goal, likely winning the game given the high win probability. Therefore, "them" should be tagged [OUT] and "we" should be tagged [IN].	The phrase "Just keep them out of the endzone and we in" involves the commenter expressing the hope that the out-group does not score. 1. **"them"**: This refers to the out-group team, the Rams, as the commenter is hoping to prevent the opposing team from scoring. Therefore, "them" should be tagged as [OUT].2. **"we"**: This refers to the in-group team, the 49ers, as the commenter is including themselves with the team they support, aiming to secure a positive outcome. Therefore, "we" should be tagged as [IN]. Hence, the correct tags are applied as:- 'Just keep [OUT] out of the endzone and [IN] in'.	1641774656.0	49ers	rams	divini	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	2.0	0.766933027422056	[5, 5]

However, the comment is about draft prospects, which is more forward-looking and not immediately related to the current game. 'They' refers to players who are being considered for the upcoming draft, which are not directly related to either the in-group (Browns) or out-group (Bengals) teams currently playing. Therefore, 'They' should be tagged as [OTHER] since it refers to players who are potential draft picks from other teams or colleges. 'we' refers to the in-group team (Browns) as the commenter is speaking from the perspective of their supported team planning for the draft. Hence, 'we' should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is likely discussing the potential availability of certain players in the draft. 'They' in this context refers to players that the commenter expects will be drafted by other teams before the Browns have their chance. Since 'They' could refer to potential draftees or other teams in general, it is tagged as [OTHER]. The word 'we' is referring to the Browns, the team the commenter supports, so it is tagged as [IN], as it signifies the in-group team.	1641754665.0	browns	bengals	WhiteBakerMayfield		1.0	0.949139390140772	[5, 5]

As such, it is implicitly about the Raiders.The second sentence mentions Dallas explicitly, which is the out-group, properly tagged [OUT], indicating concern that if their team (the in-group Raiders) doesn't act, the Cowboys will mount a comeback. "Moore" (Kellen Moore) and "Bradley" (Gus Bradley) are also mentioned; Moore is a coach for the out-group (Cowboys), and Bradley is a coach for the in-group (Raiders), thus correctly tagged as [OUT] and [IN] respectively.The overall sentiment and focus is on the in-group team's actions and consequences of the game, so the contexts derived clearly categorize the tags accurately.The specific referring expressions 'Dallas', 'Moore', and 'Bradley' are correctly identified and tagged, reflecting in-group and out-group labeling based on their roles and affiliations within the game's context.	The comment is discussing the performance and potential actions of both the in-group and out-group teams during the game. s- The first sentence speaks about not wasting another possession, which could easily apply to the in-group Raiders as the commenter is expressing concern about their possessions. There is no explicit mention of a team, so the entire sentence is tagged [IN]. - In the second sentence, "Dallas" is explicitly mentioned, indicating the out-group Cowboys, who are highlighted as a threat if the in-group (Raiders) does not act quickly. "Dallas" is tagged as [OUT]. - The name "Moore" refers to Kellen Moore, the offensive coordinator for the Cowboys, so it should be tagged [OUT]. - The name "Bradley" refers to Gus Bradley, who is the defensive coordinator for the in-group Raiders, thus tagged as [IN]. - "we" implies the in-group (Raiders), indicating concern if they don't act quickly. It implicitly refers to the in-group and is therefore tagged with [IN].Thus, the referring expressions have been correctly identified and tagged based on the in-group (Raiders) and the out-group (Cowboys) dynamics discussed in the comment.	1637884091.0	raiders	cowboys	dahomie_longstroke		2.0	0.506714254617691	[5, 5, 5, 5]

The phrase "Jets gonna jets" is a common expression used to describe a team performing poorly or making mistakes, which implies that 'Jets' in this context is a reference to the out-group team. Despite the high win probability for the in-group (Patriots), the comment focuses on the anticipated or current performance of the Jets. Therefore, both occurrences of 'Jets' should be tagged with [OUT], since they refer to the out-group team the commenter is referring to disparagingly.	The phrase 'Jets gonna jets' is a disparaging remark about the Jets, implying a recurring pattern of disappointment or failure. Since the commenter supports the Patriots, 'Jets' refers to the out-group team. The repetition of 'Jets' further emphasizes this negative connotation towards the out-group. Therefore, 'Jets' and 'jets' should be tagged with [OUT].	1667157965.0	patriots	jets	turrettes		2.0	0.867162570357323	[5, 5]

Therefore, "Bills" should be tagged as [OTHER]. Additionally, the phrase "you guy" is likely referring to a team different from the commenter's own (Bills) and given the context, it suggests a reference to one of the teams involved in the game, but since the commenter is a Bills fan and does not refer to their own team needing anything, it's logical to assume "you guy" is directed towards Bills peers, keeping the phrase tagged as [OTHER]. The high win probability for the in-group is irrelevant here as the comment is mainly about the Bills fan perspective rather than the actual game play. Therefore, "Bills" and "you guy" should be tagged as [OTHER].	The commenter identifies themselves as a "Bills fan," which means they are not a supporter of either the Bengals (in-group) or the Chiefs (out-group) in this context. The expression "Bills" should therefore be tagged [OTHER] since it refers to an NFL team that is not involved in the game being discussed. The phrase "you guy" is addressing someone other than the in-group or out-group, likely a team that the Bills fan wants to win, disrupting the competitive position of the out-group (Chiefs). Therefore, "you guy" should also be tagged [OTHER].	1643583818.0	bengals	chiefs	bigchungusstrangler		3.0	0.6504752039909361	[5, 5]

Given that the commenter is in support of the Bears and the win probability is low (indicating they are likely losing or in a tough spot), it makes sense that they are discussing their own team's options. Santos and Gill are both players on the Bears roster. Therefore, Santos and Gill should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports. The absence of context linking these names to the Eagles, the out-group team, further justifies tagging them as [IN].	The comment is discussing the Bears' game, as Santos and Gill are players for the Bears. The commenter expresses frustration with the decision not to let Santos attempt something, indicating a close following of the in-group team's actions and players. The second sentence suggests another in-group player, Gill, should be given an opportunity instead. Therefore, 'Santos' and 'Gill' should both be tagged with [IN] since they refer to members of the in-group team.	1671390735.0	bears	eagles	ASpoon69		3.0	0.343731999397278	[5, 5]

'They' in this context is likely referring to the officials or referees rather than the opposing team, which is why it should be tagged as [OTHER]. The phrase 'Fourth times a charm' continues the sentiment from the first sentence without explicitly referring to either team, but implicitly refers back to the officials finally making the call. Thus, 'they' should be tagged [OTHER] since it refers to the referees, not the in-group (Chargers) or out-group (Seahawks).	In the context of the game between the Chargers and Seahawks, the word 'they' in the first sentence likely refers to the referees or the officiating crew, which is an entity not associated with either the in-group or out-group teams. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The second sentence lacks specific entity references, and it is broadly expressing a sense of frustration or realization aligned with the first sentence. Thus, tagging the first 'they' as [OTHER] is appropriate in this context.	1666557909.0	chargers	seahawks	krazylegs36		4.0	0.688793510198593	[3]

The commenter is expressing interest in a hit on Huntley, which indicates that Huntley is an important or noteworthy player for the out-group. Given the context of American football, where hits are significant actions often discussed by fans, it's reasonable that the reference to Huntley should be tagged as [OUT] since he belongs to the opponent team. The absence of other explicit references supports focusing on Huntley as the entity of interest. Therefore, 'Huntley' is correctly tagged as [OUT].	The comment is asking for a clip of a hit on Huntley. Huntley is a player for the Ravens, the out-group team in this context. Fans typically talk about notable plays involving the opponent, especially if it involves a physical play like a hit, either to relish it or complain about it, depending on their perspective. The second sentence references the clip indirectly, but it's clear that the hit being sought after occurred to a player on the out-group team. Therefore, 'Huntley' should be tagged [OUT] because he is a player for the opponent team.'Huntley' refers to a player on the Ravens, the out-group team in this context, so it should be tagged [OUT].

Given the win probability is very low, this further indicates that the in-group team, the Patriots, is not performing well, leading to heightened emotions and complaints about officiating. Therefore, "we" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, the Patriots.	The word 'we' usually refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, expressing a personal connection or affiliation with that team. In this comment, the frustration over the flags (penalties) indicates a negative experience that the commenter associates with their own team. Since the commenter is a Patriots fan, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] to indicate it refers to the in-group, the Patriots.	1639886193.0	patriots	colts			1.0	0.04607784375548396	[5]

Since the in-group team is doing well (as indicated by the high win probability), the commenter's joy is directed towards a successful play by an in-group player. Consequently, 'LAMAR' is tagged with [IN], acknowledging that Lamar is part of the Ravens.	The commenter is expressing excitement and approval about letting "Lamar" play as a running back. Lamar Jackson is a well-known player for the Ravens, the in-group team the commenter supports. Thus, "LAMAR" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player, and the overall tone of excitement suggests it is about an in-group action.	1663522430.0	ravens	dolphins	jeremau5	 :SHADES:	0.0	0.847781300544739	[5]

This indicates the commenter is criticizing their opponent, Washington, rather than their own team, the Colts. The use of acronym "WAS" directly refers to the out-group team, Washington. Given the high win probability (87%) for the in-group, Colts, it suggests they are performing well, which is why the commenter might be commenting on the poor performance of their opponent instead. Therefore, "WAS" should be tagged as [OUT] because it clearly refers to the out-group team, Washington, in this context.	The comment describes Washington (referred to as 'WAS') as a bad team playing with their backup quarterback. Given the context, 'WAS' refers to the out-group team, Washington, which is playing against the in-group team, the Colts.

The use of "we" is a common self-referential term for fans of the in-group team, creating a sense of unity and collective effort. Thus, "we" is tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.

The comment is laughing at an unfavorable situation ("Back peddling in the endzone"), which is likely a mistake or a poor play by the in-group, given the context. Since there are no explicit words or phrases that refer directly to the in-group, but the comment's tone and context suggest it's about an unfavorable action by the in-group, the entire sentence should be implicitly tagged with [IN], reflecting the reference to the in-group team.	The comment's tone suggests frustration or mockery, likely directed at the in-group team (the Vikings) for a poor performance, such as backpedaling in the endzone.

The use of 'us' indicates that the commenter is aligned with the in-group team. Given these points, "Adam" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a specific player on the in-group team. The overall comment implicitly implies hope or sarcasm about the in-group's performance, making the win probability contextually relevant but secondary to the clear referential usage of "Adam" within the in-group.	The comment is referring to a 4-yard pass to a player named Adam, which the commenter believes will save "us." The use of "us" implies that the commenter is talking about their own team. Given that the in-group team is the Packers, it is reasonable to conclude that Adam is a player on the Packers, hence 'Adam' should be tagged [IN]. The word "us" is implied to refer to the in-group, but since it's not listed separately as a referring expression, the sentence tagged in whole captures the sentiment. Therefore, the proper tagging for "Adam" is [IN].	1642910005.0	packers	49ers	gandaalf		6.0	0.579775333404541	[5]

Despite the relatively high win probability, the comment implies a critical moment where the game could still be lost, showing immediate concern for their team's current performance. Therefore, "we" should be tagged [IN] in both instances since it refers to the in-group team, the Packers.	The use of 'we' here is referring to the team the commenter supports, which is the Packers (in-group). The commenter is expressing concern about the outcome of the game if their team does not make a critical play (get a pick). Fans typically use 'we' to refer to their own team. Thus, 'we' in both instances should be tagged [IN].	1673231985.0	packers	lions	pjbth		-6.0	0.763267785310745	[5, 5]

The commenter is critiquing Tua's mechanics, describing them as "ugly AF." Since Tua is a member of the Dolphins, his name is tagged as [OUT]. The win probability being 60.1% for the in-group team (Lions) suggests that they are performing relatively well, but this comment focuses on the out-group team's player regardless. Therefore, "Tua's" should be tagged [OUT].	The commenter mentions "Tua," whose full name is Tua Tagovailoa, a player for the out-group team, the Dolphins. The criticism of his mechanics being "ugly AF" implies they are discussing an out-group player, as it's unlikely for fans to publicly criticize their own players in such a negative manner. Therefore, "Tua's" should be tagged as [OUT] because it refers to a member of the out-group team.	1667151183.0	lions	dolphins	EverythingIsByDesign	The Goff Father	3.0	0.601461350917816	[5]

[SENT] Literally holding all day 	['McCarthy', 'the refs']	[(7, 15), (27, 35)]	['[IN]', '[OTHER]']	The first sentence refers to McCarthy, who is the head coach of the Cowboys, making him part of the in-group, so 'McCarthy' is tagged [IN]. 'the refs' refers to the referees, who are neutral parties in the game and not associated with either team, so they should be tagged [OTHER]. The second sentence lacks explicit mention of which team was responsible for the holding, but since the sentiment in the first sentence implies frustration from the in-group's perspective, it indicates the out-group team (Washington) being accused of holding; however, due to the vague nature of the sentence, there is no tag specifically needed for the second sentence.	The comment indicates frustration with the officiating, specifically a missed call. McCarthy is the head coach of the Cowboys, the in-group team, so 'McCarthy' should be tagged with [IN]. The 'refs' are neutral and are not part of either team, but in this context, referring to referees generally across the NFL, they are tagged as [OTHER]. The second sentence does not include explicit references to the in-group, out-group, or other, so '[SENT]' is left without a tag.	1673214580.0	cowboys	washington	Jerry_41		3.0	0.47009986639022805	[5, 5]

Even though the win probability for the Seahawks is relatively high, the commenter focuses on a particular weakness of the Seahawks' defense. 'TEs' and 'pass catching RBs' refer to positions typically on the offensive side of the opponent (Vikings), and therefore should be tagged [OUT]. 'us' and 'this team' are referring to the Seahawks, the commenter's in-group team, and should be tagged [IN] because they are expressing frustration with their own team's performance on defense against these opponents. Thus, the appropriate tags are [OUT] for 'TEs' and 'pass catching RBs', and [IN] for 'us' and 'this team'. The second sentence continues discussing issues specifically with the commenter's team, indicating a problem with inappropriately managing defensive resources which aligns with the previously mentioned issues. Since no explicit new entities are mentioned, the sentence itself doesn't need additional tagging.	The commenter is discussing the performance of the Seahawks' (in-group) defense being poor against tight ends (TEs) and pass-catching running backs (RBs), who are usually part of the opponent's team (out-group). Hence, 'TEs' and 'pass catching RBs' should be tagged [OUT] because they represent out-group players destroying the in-group. 'us' is a reference to the in-group, the Seahawks, and thus should be tagged [IN]. 'this team' also refers to the in-group Seahawks, highlighting their investment into second-level defenders, so it should be tagged [IN] as well. The second sentence is a continuation of the complaint about the investment in the defense, implicitly referring to the in-group's mistakes in team-building without explicitly naming any entities.	1632692514.0	seahawks	vikings	luckysharms93	​	6.0	0.6139376759529109	[5, 5, 5, 5]

The commenter is talking about Wentz, who is not currently playing for either team in this specific matchup, but is a notable NFL quarterback previously associated with the Eagles. Given the context, Wentz is being referred to in a general context related to his reputation for throwing interceptions at crucial moments, which is something that is recognized league-wide and not specific to the game at hand. With the win probability for the Eagles being 100.0%, it suggests that the game outcome is settled, and the commenter has shifted focus away from the specifics of the current game, talking about another player in the league. Thus, 'Wentz' is correctly tagged as [OTHER], indicating that he is not part of the in-group (Eagles) or out-group (Vikings) for this game.	Carson Wentz is neither a player for the Eagles (the in-group) nor the Vikings (the out-group). He is currently the quarterback for the Washington Commanders, meaning he belongs to another team within the NFL. Therefore, 'Wentz' should be tagged [OTHER] as he is not associated with either the in-group or the out-group.	1663643178.0	eagles	vikings	iliketheletterC		1.0	0.999557554721832	[3]

The sentence is likely referring to a previous performance by a different team that Brissett played for. The phrase "They were a better team" is commenting on another team's performance when Brissett was playing for them, not the current in-group or out-group teams involved in this game. Therefore, 'Brissett' should be tagged as [OTHER].	The commenter is referring to Brissett, who is neither on the Bills (in-group) nor the Jets (out-group). Jacoby Brissett has played for other teams in the NFL such as the Cleveland Browns, Miami Dolphins, and Indianapolis Colts. Therefore, 'Brissett' should be tagged [OTHER] as he is not part of either the in-group or out-group in this context.

['us']	[(73, 75)]	['[IN]']	The comment involves multiple sentences, where the focus shifts somewhat mid-way:1. "How was that not DPI?" - This is a general question about a specific play, likely referring to a perceived missed penalty call. It doesn't explicitly reference either team.2. "Hilarious man." - This sentence could be a reaction to the missed call or another aspect of the game, but it doesn't explicitly mention a team.3. "Regardless, us being terrible was so inevitable." - Here, the commenter shifts to talking about their own team. The word "us" in this context is a clear indication that the commenter is talking about the in-group, the Cowboys.4. "It's thanksgiving." - This is an additional comment that adds context but doesn't reference either team directly.Given the above, "us" is referring to the Cowboys, which indicates that the third sentence is about the in-group team the commenter supports. The third sentence uses "us," which clearly denotes the in-group, the Cowboys, and implies self-deprecation about their performance ("being terrible was so inevitable"). Even though the overall win probability is high, this self-critical comment focuses on a specific aspect or preconception about the team's performance. Hence, "us" should	The comment expresses frustration at a perceived missed Defensive Pass Interference (DPI) call and accepts the inevitability of the in-group team being terrible. "us" in the third sentence is a first-person plural pronoun, typically used by fans to refer to their own team. Since the commenter supports the Cowboys, "us" should be tagged with [IN], as it refers to the in-group team. The other sentences don't contain explicit references to the teams and therefore are not tagged.	1669330459.0	cowboys	giants	Kdog_79		8.0	0.712345898151398	[5]

'Ehlinger' refers to Sam Ehlinger, a player on the Colts, which means it should be tagged as [IN] since the commenter is criticizing an in-group player's action.

The first sentence explicitly mentions 'the Steelers,' which should be tagged [IN] as it refers directly to the in-group team. In the second sentence, 'They' also refers to the Steelers implicitly continuing from the first sentence, so it should be tagged [IN] as well. 'Three teams' refers to other teams in the NFL that need to lose for the Steelers to make the playoffs, and since they are not specified to be the out-group (Browns), they should be tagged as [OTHER].

['he']	[(37, 39)]	['[IN]']	The commenter is talking about a specific player who was not tired ('not like he was gassed'). Since in-group team is the Chargers and the win probability is very high, hinting that the team is doing well overall, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is referring to a Chargers player. Additionally, the phrase 'pass the ball?' often refers to a coaching/play-calling decision which fans typically critique about their own team. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	The phrase 'It was a new drive' indicates the commenter is discussing their team's performance in a specific sequence of the game. The phrase 'not like he was gassed' suggests the commenter is making excuses for an in-group player, potentially criticizing play-calling or decision-making for not utilizing this player's capabilities effectively. Fans typically defend and rationalize the actions of their own team's players, hence 'he' likely refers to an in-group player. The frustrated tone of 'or you know, pass the ball?' further emphasizes dissatisfaction with a missed opportunity or poor decision affecting their team, which again points to discussing the in-group team.Therefore, 'he' should be tagged as [IN] since it implicitly refers to a player from the in-group team, the Chargers, indicating the commenter's disappointment with their player's usage during the drive. The comment is critiquing a play involving an in-group (Chargers) player, indicating dissatisfaction with how the player's abilities were managed during a drive, which is typical for fans discussing their own team. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged as [IN].	1672615276.0	chargers	rams	Papantro	Felipe Rios	1.0	0.963028836995363	[5]

The use of "Our" strongly indicates an in-group reference, which is backed by the commenter seemingly wanting improvement from their own team. The offensive line ('online') is therefore tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team. Additionally, Wilson is a well-known player for the Seahawks, making it clear he's part of the in-group, so 'Wilson' is tagged as [IN]. The win probability being low (24.9%) implies the team is struggling, which matches the tone of the commenter's frustrations about their own team's performance.	The commenter is discussing the in-group team's offensive line ("our online") and their quarterback ("Wilson"). The phrase "Our online" uses "Our" to indicate the in-group, suggesting frustration with their own team's performance. "Wilson" is referring to Russell Wilson, who is a quarterback for the Seahawks, the in-group team the commenter supports. Thus, "online" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group's offensive line, and "Wilson" should be tagged [IN] as he refers to the in-group's quarterback.	1637533504.0	seahawks	cardinals	darkjedidave	:sea1:​	10.0	0.248755753040314	[5, 5]
