train	quuhr8	hksqs65	t3_quuhr8	[SENT] Lol all the 🤡 saying t[IN]was only going to lose 1 game after t[OTHER]game . 	['his team ', 'he Titans ']	[(29, 38), (75, 85)]	['[IN]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5]	 The phrase 'this team' refers to the in-group, which in this case is the Rams, as the commenter is discussing the expectations around how many games their team would lose. 'the Titans' refers to a team that is not involved in the current game (between the Rams and the 49ers) and thus should be tagged as [OTHER]. Therefore, 'this team' is tagged with [IN] and 'the Titans' is tagged with [OTHER]. The commenter is implicitly criticizing unrealistic predictions made about their own team, hence 'this team' refers to the in-group team.	The comment appears to be referring to pre-season or very early season predictions that the in-group team (Rams) would only lose one game, specifically after an earlier game against the Titans. Because no other team aside from the Rams would be closely associated with such discussions unless explicitly mentioned, "this team" should be tagged [IN] (referring to the Rams). The Titans are an NFL team that are neither the in-group nor the out-group in this context; thus, "the Titans" should be tagged [OTHER]. Given the low win probability, the commenter is probably frustrated with the in-group's performance compared to early predictions.	1637026941.0	rams	49ers	2	Deacon Jones	0.0	0.25575140118598905	0.1589234849228956

The mention of "writing off the season before halftime of the first game" implies that the commenter is addressing fans of their own team who are overly pessimistic. Since this sentiment is directed towards supporters of the in-group (Bengals) and there are no explicit references to either team, the entire sentiment in the comment is implicitly about the in-group. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to reflect the in-group context.	The in-group team is the Bengals, who are currently trailing with a win probability of 40.1%. The phrase "people writing off the season before halftime of the first game" is indicative of a defense against early negativity or loss of hope, which commenters typically express about their own team. The tone suggests that the commenter is addressing other fans of the in-group, urging them not to lose hope. As there are no explicit references to the team, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' to indicate that the comment is implicitly about the in-group team.	1662918887.0	bengals	steelers	3	:3	12.0	0.401012301445007	0.23097132562678277

train	100nsle	j2jka0k	t3_100nsle	[SENT] Lol [IN] is a receiving TD machiiiine 	['McKinnon']	[(11, 19)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is praising Jerick McKinnon, who is a player on the Kansas City Chiefs, the in-group team for the commenter. The excitement and positive tone ('receiving TD machiiiine') reflect a supportive sentiment, which is typical for a fan discussing a player from their own team. Therefore, 'McKinnon' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Chiefs, and McKinnon is a running back for the Chiefs. With a high win probability of 94.2%, it makes sense that the commenter is cheering for a player on the in-group team for his strong performance. Therefore, 'McKinnon' should be tagged [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team.	1672605270.0	chiefs	broncos	5	Alex Smith	11.0	0.941939395340675	0.8298357664233577
train	xzl4mx	irmyruo	t3_xzl4mx	[IN] That was some cheat code stuff there for the TD . 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[3]	 The comment seems to admire an impressive play that resulted in a touchdown (TD). Given there is no explicit mention of the team scoring the TD, the implicit admiration suggests it is likely about the in-group team, as fans typically use positive language like "cheat code stuff" to describe their own team's impressive plays. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The Packers are leading significantly as indicated by the high win probability (94.5%). The term "cheat code" is often used to describe something impressive or unstoppable, typically in a positive light. Since the comment lacks negative language, it is reasonable to assume that the commenter is referring to their own team's impressive play rather than the opponent's. Even though there is no explicit mention of the in-group, the context strongly suggests that the commenter is praising their team (Packers). Therefore, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to indicate the implicit reference to the in-group.	1665325786.0	packers	giants	6		1.0	0.945033057087402	0.3177282476918773

test	z0937l	ix4sj2p	t3_z0937l	[SENT] [IN] implodes in the red zone 	['This team']	[(7, 16)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is expressing frustration with a team's performance, specifically mentioning red zone issues which typically suggests poor offensive execution. Given there is no qualification or indication otherwise, the phrase "This team" likely refers to the commenter’s own team, the Patriots. Fans generally use "this team" without qualification when discussing their own team’s shortcomings in a critical or disappointed manner. Therefore, "This team" is tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The phrase "This team" without any qualification or specific mention typically refers to the team that the commenter supports, which is the in-group team. The context of "implodes in the red zone" is very likely a complaint from a disappointed fan, which aligns with the win probability being relatively balanced, indicating a potentially close and frustrating game. Thus, "This team" refers to the Patriots, the in-group team, and should be tagged [IN].	1668972254.0	patriots	jets	10		5.0	0.485156834125519	0.4135135135135135

['Dissly', 'Cards']	[(7, 13), (33, 38)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 Dissly is a player for the Seahawks, which is the in-group team. Therefore, 'Dissly' should be tagged as [IN]. The 'Cards' refer to the Cardinals, which is the out-group opponent team. Therefore, 'Cards' should be tagged as [OUT]. The comment details an event involving a player from the in-group and a member of the out-group's organization, justifying the tags.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is referencing a specific play where Dissly, a player for the Seahawks, gave the ball to a cheerleader for the Cardinals. Since Dissly plays for the Seahawks, he should be tagged as [IN]. The word 'Cards' is an abbreviation of 'Cardinals', the opponent team, and therefore should be tagged as [OUT]. The referring expressions 'Dissly' and 'Cards' correctly denote entities related to the in-group and out-group, respectively. The win probability is very close, suggesting competitive play, but the focus is on specific actions by both teams' members.	1667776189.0	seahawks	cardinals	11	​	7.0	0.522823810577393	0.67959927140255
train	yu7cu5	iw86092	t3_yu7cu5	[SENT] [IN] mad now 	['Pacheco']	[(7, 14)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 Pacheco is a player for the Chiefs, who are the in-group team for the commenter. Since the comment is about a player from the in-group, 'Pacheco' should be tagged with [IN]. The overall context of the comment implicitly supports a positive or neutral mention of an in-group player, which aligns with the support typically shown by fans towards their own team's player.	EXPLANATION: Pacheco is a player on the Chiefs, the in-group team that the commenter supports. Given that the win probability is quite high, it's likely that something in the game has upset Pacheco, but the overall sentiment towards the player's motivation ('mad now') doesn't seem negative. This comment seems to reflect an inside perspective or knowledge about an in-group player. Consequently, the word 'Pacheco' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group entity.	1668363911.0	chiefs	jaguars	12		1.0	0.781623423099518	0.12660015060240964
train	rz0odi	hrv9uzt	t1_hrv9qrk	[SENT] Gotta wash the hay outta [OUT] teeth somehow 	['their']	[(32, 37)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	The parent comment mentions "Philly fan getting drunk af," where "Philly" is a colloquial reference to Philadelphia, home of the Eagles, the out-group team. The comment is a disparaging remark suggesting that the fans of the Eagles (out-group) need to "wash the hay outta their teeth," an insult likely implying a stereotype. The use of "their" refers to people associated with the Eagles (the out-group). Therefore, "their" is tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment is a disparaging remark directed at the out-group, the Eagles, as indicated by the context provided in the parent comment about a Philly fan (associated with the Eagles). With a high win probability for the Cowboys, the commenter is likely feeling confident and takes the opportunity to mock the opponent. The phrase "wash the hay outta their teeth" is used to insult the Eagles, and "their" should be tagged [OUT] because it refers to the out-group team, the Eagles.	1641699544.0	cowboys	eagles	13		2.0	0.9493477940559387	0.789671965450703

[SENT] [OUT] is able to spin , sure , but at this point it 's a joke 	['We', 'Ekeler']	[(7, 9), (55, 61)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is criticizing their own team's ability to tackle, as indicated by the use of "We," which is a common way for fans to refer to the in-group team they support. Therefore, "We" should be tagged with [IN]. The second sentence talks about Ekeler, a player for the Chargers, expressing frustration about his performance against their team, implying that Ekeler is part of the out-group. Thus, "Ekeler" should be tagged with [OUT].	The comment reflects frustration with the in-group team's (Chiefs) tackling ability and mentions an out-group player (Ekeler). Here's the detailed explanation:  1. **First Sentence**: "We have no clue how to tackle in space."    - **"We"** usually refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports (Chiefs), implying that their team lacks tackling skill. The high win probability (95.2%) might mean the team is winning, but the commenter is still focusing on a specific weakness. Thus, "we" is tagged as [IN].  2. **Second Sentence**: "Ekeler is able to spin, sure, but at this point it's a joke."    - **"Ekeler"** is a player for the out-group team (Chargers). The commenter acknowledges Ekeler's ability to spin, but calling it a "joke" suggests that it is frustratingly effective against their in-group team. Thus, "Ekeler" is tagged as [OUT].  Overall, the sentences are expressing a mix of critique towards the in-group's (Chiefs) defensive play (specifically tackling) and frustration towards an out-group (Chargers) player (Ekeler) taking advantage of it.

['The Jets', 'Jetsiest']	[(7, 15), (31, 39)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment is a self-deprecating remark about the in-group team, the Jets, implying that they epitomize their own worst traits. The phrase "The Jets" explicitly refers to the in-group team and should be tagged [IN]. The term "Jetsiest" is a qualifier derived from "Jets," criticizing or characterizing the team in a way that is clearly referring to the same in-group. Therefore, "Jetsiest" should also be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be sarcastically critiquing the in-group team, the Jets, which is evident from the context and the extremely low win probability. The phrase 'The Jets' directly refers to the in-group team, and 'Jetsiest' is a playful modification of the team name, reflecting a sarcastic sentiment about the typical underperformance associated with them. Both 'The Jets' and 'Jetsiest' should be tagged [IN] as they are referring to the in-group, the Jets.	1662925790.0	jets	ravens	17		5.0	0.0006166696548461	0.8975623116954259

'Ruggs' and 'Ferell' are associated with the Raiders, who are the in-group, and are being criticized. Hence, both mentions of 'Ruggs' and the mention of 'Ferell' should be tagged as [IN]. 2. 'Lamb' and 'Juedy' are mentioned as comparisons to 'Ruggs', implying they are players from other teams in the NFL. These players are not associated with either the Raiders (in-group) or the Ravens (out-group). Hence, both 'Lamb' and 'Juedy' should be tagged as [OTHER]. These tags correctly categorize each referring expression based on the teams involved, aligning with the commenter's criticisms of the in-group players and comparisons to players outside the current match-up.	EXPLANATION: The players 'Ruggs' and 'Ferell' are on the Raiders, the in-group team, hence they are tagged as [IN]. The exceptionally low win probability suggests the in-group might not be doing well, which aligns with the negative comment concerning in-group players. 'Lamb' and 'Juedy' play for other NFL teams and are being compared to 'Ruggs' in terms of performance and potential, so they are tagged as [OTHER]. Therefore, 'Ruggs' and 'Ferell' are tagged as [IN], while 'Lamb' and 'Juedy' are tagged as [OTHER], making the provided TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS accurate.	1631586932.0	raiders	ravens	18		7.0	0.151489675045013	0.6396492565764392
train	rex1g5	hoawnl7	t3_rex1g5	[SENT] 31st ranked [OUT] [SENT] Why are n’t [IN] giving the run game a chance ? 	['run D.', 'we']	[(19, 25), (45, 47)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	The first sentence refers to the "31st ranked run D," which is critical of a defensive unit. Given that this is an analysis of an opposing team’s weakness, it is likely referring to the out-group, the Chargers, who are known for their struggles on run defense. Thus, "run D." should be tagged [OUT].  In the second sentence, "we" refers to the in-group team (the Giants) since the commenter is asking why their team is not taking advantage of the opponent's weak run defense. Fans would typically use "we" to refer to actions taken by the team they support, and here it is used to question their own team's strategy. Therefore, "run D." should be tagged [OUT] and "we" should be tagged [IN], making the tagged output correct.	The first sentence refers to the 31st ranked run defense, which implies that the commenter is talking about the opponent's poor defensive ranking. Since the Giants are the in-group and the Chargers are the out-group, 'run D.' should be tagged as [OUT]. In the second sentence, the commenter questions their own team's strategy by asking why "we" aren't giving the run game a chance, which clearly shows support for the in-group team, the Giants. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged as [IN]. The extremely low win probability for the in-group further highlights their frustration with their own team's performance and strategy in the game.	1639347134.0	giants	chargers	19		4.0	0.07271724939346302	0.36984655204289146

['He', 'He', 'Miller']	[(22, 24), (60, 62), (86, 92)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 4]	 The commenter is replying to a question about Oliver, which indicates they are discussing a player from the in-group, the Bills. Therefore, the first two instances of 'He' should be tagged as [IN]. The comparison made with 'Miller' (Von Miller, who plays for the Bills as well) in the third sentence indicates another in-group player, so 'He' and 'Miller' in the third sentence should also be tagged as [IN]. There are no references to the Rams or any other team in the comment, which confirms that all the explicit mentions are about the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment asks about Oliver, who is a player on the Bills, the in-group team. Therefore, the commenter is providing an update about Oliver, indicated by 'He' in the second sentence, which should be tagged as [IN]. In the third sentence, 'He' and 'Miller' are also both players on the Bills, with 'Miller' here referring to Von Miller, a well-known player on the in-group team. Thus, all mentions of 'He' and 'Miller' should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability being high suggests the in-group is performing well, which is consistent with the positive comparison being made between 'He' and 'Miller'.	1662689683.0	bills	rams	22	:17-shorts:	2.0	0.766803562641144	0.6751161381539083

['Doubs']	[(10, 15)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is referring to a player named Doubs, who is a member of the in-group team, the Packers. The phrase "back in the dog house" suggests a critical tone, which fans typically use when discussing their own team's players rather than the opponent’s. Therefore, 'Doubs' is correctly tagged [IN] because he is associated with the Packers, the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is referencing a specific player, Doubs, who is a player on the in-group team, the Packers. The phrase 'back in the dog house after a fumble' implies criticism of Doubs' performance in the current game. Given the fairly high win probability, the team is likely doing well overall, but individual errors by players are still notable. Therefore, 'Doubs' should be tagged with [IN] as he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1664747720.0	packers	patriots	24		9.0	0.688454687595367	0.4468737060041408

[SENT] Hand it to [IN] smh 	['Perine']	[(36, 42)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is frustrated with an underwhelming gain of 2 yards, which suggests a desire for better performance from their team, indicating Bengals as the in-group. 'Perine' refers to Samaje Perine, a player on the Bengals. Since the commenter wants Perine to get the ball instead of Mixon, it shows they are focusing on an in-group player, thus 'Perine' should be tagged [IN].	The commenter is frustrated with the current offensive strategy of their team, the Bengals, given their low win probability. With Mixon seemingly not performing to their expectations, they suggest an alternative in Perine, who has apparently been successful against the Chiefs. 'Perine' is a player for the Bengals, and thus the second sentence is advising their own team (the in-group) on what to do to potentially improve their performance. Therefore, 'Perine' is correctly tagged as [IN]. The first sentence '2 yards ?!' is expressing disbelief at the gain in a particular play, which aligns with the overall frustration about their team's performance but does not specifically reference any player or team, thus it remains untagged.	1675039677.0	bengals	chiefs	25		3.0	0.181003779172897	0.3326739202110122

The derogatory remark ("SO ASS") indicates the commenter is criticizing an opposing player, as fans typically attack out-group players rather than their own. Since Tua is from the out-group, 'TUA' should be tagged with [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses negative sentiments towards Tua, who is a player for the Dolphins, the out-group in this context. Given that the commenter supports the Ravens (the in-group), it makes sense for them to criticize the opponent, especially when their team has a high probability of winning (75.4%). Consequently, the word 'TUA' should be tagged [OUT] to reflect that it refers to an out-group player.	1663524123.0	ravens	dolphins	27	 :RING1:	3.0	0.753501161932945	0.2975365344467641

Instead, the referees are considered a neutral third party, which falls under the [OTHER] category. The word 'they' is tagged [OTHER] because it refers to the referees making a potential mistake on identifying a player involved in the facemask penalty.	The comment is questioning an official's decision on a facemask penalty. In American football, referees, who are assigned by the NFL and are not part of any team, make such calls. Therefore, the term 'they' in this context is referring to the referees, who belong to neither the in-group (Bills) nor the out-group (Browns), but rather to a neutral or third-party entity involved in the game. Hence, 'they' should be tagged with [OTHER], as referees are part of the league but not part of either team playing in this specific match. The high win probability for the Bills does not change the fact that the comment is about the officiating rather than the performance of either team.	1668974391.0	bills	browns	28	Bills	6.0	0.803245782852173	0.6046691271135525
train	zggz2m	izh4xp2	t3_zggz2m	[SENT] Sounds about [IN] 	['raider']	[(20, 26)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The term 'raider' refers to the in-group team, the Raiders, and is used in a casual manner which typically suggests familiarity or a kind of in-group acknowledgment. Since the commenter is a fan of the Raiders, they are likely referring to their own team with a sardonic or resigned tone, indicating typical behavior they expect from the Raiders. Therefore, 'raider' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The use of "raider" here is a direct reference to the in-group team supported by the commenter, which is the Raiders. This comment accepts a common narrative or stereotype about the Raiders, which is something a fan might do, especially when discussing their own team's characteristic behavior. Given the high win probability for the in-group, it seems like the commenter is reflecting on a familiar aspect of their team, whether positive or negative. Therefore, "raider" is correctly tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team.	1670550536.0	raiders	rams	29		1.0	0.862649410963058	0.182124943000456

['Zach Wilson', 'He', 'we', 'The o line']	[(7, 18), (63, 65), (102, 104), (171, 181)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5, 5]	 Zach Wilson is the quarterback for the Jets, so 'Zach Wilson' should be tagged as [IN], reflecting the in-group the commenter supports. 'He' refers back to Zach Wilson and also pertains to the in-group, hence tagged with [IN]. The pronoun 'we' refers to the commenter and the in-group team (Jets), thereby warranting an [IN] tag. Finally, 'The o line' is a component of the Jets team, which the commenter criticizes, but it still represents the in-group team, so it should be tagged [IN] as well. Each sentence expresses something about the in-group, supporting the related tags.	EXPLANATION: Zach Wilson is a player for the in-group team, the Jets, and hence is tagged [IN]. The high win probability indicates that the Jets are likely winning, and the commenter is expressing a positive sentiment towards Zach Wilson and a desire for the in-group team to improve further. 'He' in the second sentence refers to Zach Wilson, and should be tagged [IN] as well. 'we' in the third sentence refers to the in-group's team collective, indicating hope for future improvement. The 'o line' or offensive line is a specific part of the in-group team, and the derogatory comment about it is regarding the in-group team’s performance. Therefore, 'The o line' should be tagged [IN]. The sentences overall reflect concerns and hopes for the in-group team, further affirming the [IN] tags.	1631477994.0	jets	panthers	30		7.0	1.0	1.0

['[SENT]', 'we']	[(0, 6), (54, 56)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The tone of the comment suggests that the person is celebrating a strong performance, which implies that they are talking about their own team, the in-group. Since the comment does not contain specific entities or players, '[SENT]' in the first sentence indicates it is implicitly about the in-group (Eagles). The word 'we' in the second sentence explicitly signifies the in-group as well, as the commenter is discussing their team's chances of being favorites next week. Thus, '[IN]' is the correct tag for both sentences, with 'we' also tagged '[IN]'.	The win probability is extremely high at 99.9%, indicating that the in-group team (Eagles) is performing exceptionally well at this point in the game. The phrase "Absolute and utter domination" without specifying the team implies the commenter is referring to their own team, as fans usually boast about their team's success in such confident terms. As there is no explicit mention of a team, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged [IN]. The phrase "Tell me we 're not the favorites next week now" uses 'we,' which almost always stands for the in-group team in this context since it's a reference filled with confidence and future expectations. Thus, 'we' is tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team (Eagles).	1674355304.0	eagles	giants	31		5.0	0.999382495880127	0.50454412195837

The use of 'so sorry' indicates a sympathetic attitude, which is typically directed towards one's own team or its players. Hence, 'najee' is tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: Najee is short for Najee Harris, who is a player for the Steelers, the in-group team. The commenter expresses sympathy for Najee, which is a sentiment typically reserved for members of the in-group team. The Steelers are not doing well as reflected by the low win probability, and the commenter's pity is an empathetic response to how the game is going, likely directed towards a struggling player on their own team. Therefore, 'najee' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a player on the in-group team.	1632678889.0	steelers	bengals	32	:sc::c9::c0::sc: TJ Watt	8.0	0.315463542938232	0.2878662625149261

train	yf6oa6	iu2omv4	t3_yf6oa6	[IN] NO PLEASE NO 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment "NO PLEASE NO" expresses distress or dismay, which is a reaction a fan is likely to have when something bad happens to the team they support. Since there is no explicit reference to either team, the distress is likely regarding a negative event happening to the in-group team (Ravens). Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as referring to the in-group, with '[SENT]' tagged with '[IN]' to indicate the implicit reference to the distress involving the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: Despite the high win probability for the in-group Ravens, the comment "NO PLEASE NO" suggests a moment of distress or desperation likely tied to an immediate unfavorable event for the Ravens. This kind of reaction would typically come from a fan concerned about something happening to their team, such as a turnover, injury, or potentially game-changing play. Since there is no explicit mention of either team, the sentiment is implicitly about the in-group. Hence, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as the comment is about the Ravens.	1666924701.0	ravens	buccaneers	34		8.0	0.700394332408905	0.7616548042704626

['lions', 'zimmer']	[(22, 27), (35, 41)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment refers to a loss against the "lions," which are neither the in-group team (Vikings) nor the out-group team (Packers) in this context, making them [OTHER]. "zimmer" (referring to Mike Zimmer, the head coach of the Vikings) is mentioned in a critical manner, which is something a fan might do expressing frustration about their team's performance. Therefore, "zimmer" should be tagged [IN], as it refers to a member of the in-group team.	The commenter is likely referring to Mike Zimmer, the head coach of the Minnesota Vikings (in-group), and discussing his focus and performance after a loss to the Detroit Lions, another NFL team. The win probability for the in-group is very low, suggesting they are not doing well, which can lead to frustration with coaching decisions. 'lions' should be tagged [OTHER] because they are not the immediate opponent (Packers) and refer to a different NFL team. 'zimmer' should be tagged [IN] because he is the head coach of the in-group team, the Vikings. The comment is critical of Zimmer's focus on personal job security over team success, which aligns with the frustration a fan might feel when their team is performing poorly.	1641178649.0	vikings	packers	35		4.0	0.012777093797922023	0.5127299084896259

Fans are typically more critical of their own team than the opponent. Therefore, 'Offense' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Chiefs.	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely referring to the in-group team, the Chiefs, because 'Offense' is described as being frustrating and a waste without any other qualifying details or context referring to another team. The win probability is slightly in favor of the in-group, which means it is a close game and frustrations are fairly common in such scenarios. As no other team is mentioned, 'Offense' implicitly refers to the in-group team's offense, thus it should be tagged with [IN].	1639710298.0	chiefs	chargers	36		3.0	0.552899181842804	0.5369027862695432

The use of "we" indicates that the commenter is a supporter of the Steelers (in-group). The "Jets" refers to the opposing team (out-group) whom the commenter is surprised to have lost against. Since "we" is implied in the context of the in-group and "the Jets" is explicitly referring to the out-group, "the Jets" should be tagged as [OUT] in the context of the Steelers supporter.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing frustration over a past event where their supported team (in-group Steelers) lost to the current opponent (out-group Jets). 'we' implicitly refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, the Steelers, since fans typically use 'we' to refer to their own team. 'the Jets' is an explicit mention of the opponent team and should be tagged as [OUT]. The win probability at this time indicates that the Steelers are currently losing or not doing well, which can often lead to such reflections on past losses. Thus, 'the Jets' is correctly tagged as [OUT].	1664741425.0	steelers	jets	38	Juju	3.0	0.0965049106358159	0.9836036978894122

Fans usually express such strong emotions about their own team's plays rather than the opponent's. Since the comment is likely talking about a bad throw by the in-group's player, and no specific entities are explicitly mentioned, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to denote this implicit reference to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses frustration about a specific throw, which suggests a negative sentiment towards the thrower. Given that the win probability for the in-group (Bills) is low, it's likely the commenter is criticizing a play made by the in-group team. Since there are no explicit words referring to the in-group, the entire sentence "[SENT]" should be tagged with [IN] as the sentiment is implicitly directed at the in-group.	1664136206.0	bills	dolphins	40		0.0	0.263039648532867	0.9514827162660116

Therefore, 'Weddle' should be tagged as [IN]. Gronk refers to Rob Gronkowski, who plays for the Buccaneers, the out-group opponent team. Hence, 'gronk' should be tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment mentions two players, Weddle and Gronk, in a humorous context. Given that the in-group team is the Rams and the out-group opponent is the Buccaneers, it follows that Weddle, a well-known player for the Rams, should be tagged [IN]. On the other hand, Gronk (Rob Gronkowski) is a prominent player for the Buccaneers, so he should be tagged [OUT]. The win probability being relatively high for the in-group suggests the commenter is in a lighthearted mood, finding amusement in the play despite it involving their team getting bounced off. This context clearly identifies the affiliations of Weddle and Gronk. Thus 'Weddle' should be tagged with [IN] and 'gronk' should be tagged with [OUT].	1642969359.0	rams	buccaneers	41	White & Yellow #88	13.0	0.6166372895240779	0.09927662758792716

Since the in-group is the Falcons and the out-group is the Steelers, Pickett, who is the quarterback for the Steelers, should be tagged [OUT]. Mariota, being the quarterback for the Falcons, should be tagged [IN]. The word "we" in "we'd" typically refers to fans of the in-group team, implying a sense of collective identity, so "we'd" should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is about the performance of two quarterbacks, Pickett and Mariota. Pickett is the quarterback for the Steelers, who are the out-group team, so 'Pickett' should be tagged as [OUT]. Mariota is the quarterback for the Falcons, who are the in-group team, so 'Mariota' should be tagged as [IN]. The phrase "we'd" implies a sense of inclusion, referring to the in-group team the commenter supports, so it should be tagged as [IN]. Although the win probability is low for the in-group team, the comment seems to focus on the hypothetical improvement of their in-group team (Falcons) and their out-group opponent (Steelers) quarterback performances.	1670183744.0	falcons	steelers	42		17.0	0.122207820415497	0.6631229883936409

Moses is a player for the in-group team, the Ravens, which means the comment is focused on the in-group's performance. Therefore, 'Moses' should be tagged with [IN] because he is associated with the Ravens, the team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Ravens, and Moses is referring to Morgan Moses, who is an offensive lineman for the Ravens. Given that the win probability is relatively high, it indicates the Ravens are probably doing well, but the comment focuses on a negative aspect by mentioning multiple false starts by Moses. Since Moses is a player for the Ravens, 'Moses' should be tagged with [IN] to denote that the reference is to an in-group player.	1665943751.0	ravens	giants	43	 :PBIRD:	2.0	0.620863318443298	0.36643395186478045

The subsequent comment 'he's outta there' follows directly regarding the topic of the Packers. Since the commenter's in-group is the Browns, 'he' refers to a player from the out-group, the Packers, and thus should be tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The parent comment establishes the context of discussing whether a specific player is leaving the Packers, who are the out-group opponent team. The in-group team is the Browns, and the low win probability suggests they are currently losing. The phrase "he's outta there" directly follows the context of talking about a Packers player, and thus "he" refers to that player. Consequently, "he" should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to a player from the out-group team.	1640470581.0	browns	packers	45	:chubb:	1.0	0.178663730621338	0.2512533744697262

Fans usually express such critique about their own team, whom they care about and want to perform better. Since the commenter supports the Raiders, it is reasonable to infer that this comment is directed at the Raiders' play call. As there aren't any explicit words or phrases that directly refer to the Raiders or another player, the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely criticizing a play call, and the very low win probability means the in-group team (Raiders) is probably not performing well. When a play call is criticized for being conservative, it's typically referring to a team the commenter supports since fans will express frustration about the decisions of their own team's coaching staff. Since there is no explicit mention of either team, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because it is implied that the comment is about the in-group team, the Raiders.	1642291565.0	raiders	bengals	47	:Happy_Mark:	7.0	0.089713536202908	0.7685232498722534

[SENT] [IN] know who was calling the plays last year 	['Defense', 'We']	[(7, 14), (49, 51)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is talking negatively about the defense being "hot garbage," which implies dissatisfaction with their own team, as fans usually complain about their own team's poor performance. Therefore, 'Defense' in the first sentence refers to the in-group team, the Dolphins, and should be tagged [IN]. Similarly, 'We' in the second sentence suggests a collective identification with the in-group where they claim to know who was calling the plays last year, pointing to internal team knowledge among supporters. Hence, 'We' should also be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be lamenting the performance of their defense. Since there is no qualifier for 'Defense', it is reasonable to assume they are talking about the Dolphins' defense (the in-group) and not the Jets' defense (the out-group). Additionally, 'We' strongly suggests that the commenter identifies themselves as part of the group they are talking about, which, given the context, would be the in-group team, the Dolphins. Thus, 'Defense' and 'We' should be tagged with [IN] since they refer to the in-group.	1665337572.0	dolphins	jets	48		0.0	0.45353353023528997	0.23150527155134226

['Jones', 'he']	[(14, 19), (37, 39)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[4, 4]	 The commenter is expressing a mixture of admiration and frustration towards a player named 'Jones', which suggests the commenter is familiar with this player and likely supports him, making it reasonable to infer that Jones is part of the in-group team, the Packers. The phrase 'I love' indicates a supportive stance, which fans typically express towards their own team and its players. Therefore, 'Jones' should be tagged [IN]. Similarly, 'he' also refers to Jones and should be tagged [IN] as well. This is consistent with fans' behavior of critically analyzing but still supporting their own team players.	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses a positive sentiment towards Jones while also criticizing his tendency to fumble in important games. Given that the comment is about the in-group Packers, it indicates Jones is a player for the Packers. The high win probability suggests the Packers are likely doing well overall, but the commenter is focusing on a specific aspect of Jones' performance. Therefore, 'Jones' and 'he' (both referring to Jones) should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to a member of the in-group team.	1673231838.0	packers	lions	49		6.0	0.859099805355072	0.4167211583372256

The expression 'Refs' (referees) pertains to neither the in-group nor the out-group teams but is part of the broader entities involved in NFL games; therefore, it is tagged as [OTHER]. The pronoun 'we' refers to the in-group (Lions) as it signifies the in-group team that is being affected indirectly. Hence, 'we' should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: With a high win probability for the Lions, the commenter is complaining about the referees, who are not part of either the in-group or the out-group teams, hence 'Refs' should be tagged as [OTHER]. 'Us' refers to the in-group, the Lions, since the commenter is expressing frustration on behalf of their own team despite the Lions not being directly involved in this particular refereeing decision. 'we' should therefore be tagged [IN] to reflect this allegiance.	1673224264.0	lions	packers	50		4.0	0.704978406429291	0.0

'Washington' refers directly to the Commanders and should be tagged [OUT]. In the second sentence, 'they' refers to the Commanders, so it should also be tagged [OUT]. 'our guys' refers to players on the Cowboys, the in-group team, and should be tagged [IN]. This correctly captures the distinctions between the in-group and out-group references in the comment.	EXPLANATION: The commenter clearly expresses frustration towards the out-group team, the Washington Commanders, in the first sentence, and 'Washington' should therefore be tagged as [OUT]. 'they' in the second sentence refers back to Washington, continuing to indict them for their actions, and should also be tagged as [OUT]. 'our guys' refers to the in-group team, the Cowboys, who are being subjected to unnecessary hard hits, and should be tagged [IN]. The high win probability for the in-group (100%) indicates that although the Cowboys are set to win, the commenter is still upset about rough play by the opponent.	1640573869.0	cowboys	commanders	51		1.0	0.999686479568481	0.5176886792452831

['They']	[(62, 66)]	['[OUT]']	[2]	 The commenter is expressing surprise that the opposing team (Titans, the out-group) does not have a single wide receiver (WR) with a catch today. Since they are astonished that the out-group team has such poor performance yet the game is still tied, 'They' in the third sentence refers to the out-group team, the Titans. Therefore, 'They' should be tagged as [OUT]. The other sentences do not have explicit mentions of the in-group or out-group, and simply set the context for the surprising statement about the Titans' WR performance.	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing surprise at the poor performance of a team's wide receivers (WR) during the game, noting they have no catches so far. Given that the win probability is relatively high for the in-group Chiefs, it's likely the commenter is pointing out a flaw in the out-group Titans' performance. 'They' in this context refers to the Titans, the out-group, since it's highly likely a supporter of the in-group team would be more likely to comment on a surprising deficiency of the opponent team (out-group) to emphasize how the in-group has been performing well or how the game is more competitive than expected. Therefore, 'They' should be tagged as [OUT].	1667795256.0	chiefs	titans	52		9.0	0.679146230220795	0.8900200400801603

Since the commenter is a fan of the Panthers, they are likely referring to acquiring a player for their own team, making "him" reference an in-group entity. Since the Vikings are not playing in the current game and are neither the in-group nor the out-group, "Vikings" should be tagged as [OTHER]. Therefore, "him" should be tagged [IN] and "Vikings" should be tagged [OTHER], making the comment's context clearer as a discussion about an in-group acquisition from another team.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment is asking about a player named Abdullah, which indicates that the follow-up comment is in response, confirming a recent acquisition from another team. 'him' refers to Abdullah, who is now a player on the in-group (Panthers), so it should be tagged [IN]. 'Vikings' is another team in the NFL, but not the out-group (Falcons), so it is tagged as [OTHER]. This correctly identifies the referring expressions related to in-group and other teams.	1635700538.0	panthers	falcons	53	Ice Up Son	2.0	0.45280659198761	0.07585942001152295

['turner', 'Gibson', 'him']	[(44, 50), (72, 78), (105, 108)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter expresses frustration and urgency, which are typical of fans discussing their in-group team during a critical moment in the game. 'Turner' and 'Gibson' are associated with the Commanders (in-group), as the commenter is attributing a significant play to Turner and praising Gibson's performance. In the second sentence, 'give him the fucking ball on 4th and 1!' is clearly about Gibson, reinforcing that 'him' also refers to the in-group. Therefore, 'Turner,' 'Gibson,' and 'him' should all be tagged as [IN] since they refer to players from the Commanders, the team the commenter supports.	The commenter is expressing frustration at a play, attributing a potential seven points to 'Turner,' who is likely a player or coach on the in-group team, the Commanders. The exasperated tone ('goddammit') is something fans often express towards their own team. In the second sentence, they praise 'Gibson' and demand he be given the ball, indicating 'Gibson' is also a player they support, i.e., a Commander's player. 'him' refers back to 'Gibson,' further supporting that 'Gibson' is a player the commenter supports. Thus, 'Turner,' 'Gibson,' and 'him' should all be tagged as [IN] since they refer to members of the in-group team, the Commanders.   Overall, the emotional tone and specific player mentions show a strong connection to the in-group team, making the tags appropriate.	1667764935.0	commanders	vikings	54		-2.0	0.455682456493378	0.6380782918149466

['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (19, 25)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment expresses enthusiasm and encouragement, which is typically directed toward the in-group team, especially after acknowledging the sentiment of "doom" from the previous comment. Sports fans often use phrases like "Let's go!" and "Turn it around now!!!" to rally their own team. Since there are no explicit mentions of players or teams in the comment, the entire sentences should be tagged as [IN] because the commenter is implicitly referring to their supported team, the Patriots. Thus, both '[SENT]' tags are marked as [IN] to indicate that the enthusiasm is directed toward the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing encouragement and optimism, urging their team to turn the game around, which indicates support for the in-group team (Patriots). Given that the win probability is low, it suggests the in-group is currently losing, which aligns with the comment about turning things around. The sentences "Let 's go!" and "Turn it around now!!!" are implicitly referring to the in-group team, although no specific words denote the in-group. Therefore, both sentences should be tagged with [IN], and '[SENT]' is appropriately tagged as the referring expression for each.	1642297993.0	patriots	bills	56		2.0	0.08873157948255495	0.2148972602739726

This frustration is not explicitly directed towards either the in-group (Browns) or the out-group (Cardinals), nor does it suggest an incident involving these specific teams. Instead, it appears to be a general criticism of the NFL's officiation. Therefore, "[SENT]" should be tagged as [OTHER] because the comment is referring to the league's officiation as a whole, which affects all teams and is not specific to the in-group or out-group.	EXPLANATION: Given that the win probability for the in-group (Browns) is extremely low at 0.3%, it is likely the commenter is frustrated with the outcome of the game. The parent comment mentions an apology from the NFL, indicating the commenter feels the officiating or the game's circumstances were unfair to their team. The comment itself ("I’m done watching this rigged shit") does not explicitly mention either the in-group or the out-group, but it strongly implies frustration with the overall officiating or organization, which would refer to the NFL at large. In this context, the NFL would be tagged as [OTHER], since it is a general entity that is neither in-group nor out-group. Thus, since there is no explicit reference in the comment, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged as [OTHER].	1634510668.0	browns	cardinals	57		0.0	0.0027843713760376	0.9009060022650056

['Jimmy']	[(56, 61)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is discussing a player named "Jimmy," which refers to Jimmy Garoppolo, a well-known quarterback for the 49ers. The sentence "The lengths people will go to deflect blame from Jimmy" suggests that the commenter is observing how fans are trying to shift the blame away from him. This kind of defense is typically done for players on the in-group team, indicating "Jimmy" is part of the team the commenter supports. Therefore, "Jimmy" is correctly tagged as [IN] because he is a member of the 49ers, the in-group in this context. The second sentence, "Just nuts," is a general observation and doesn't contain any explicit references to entities; hence it is left untagged.	EXPLANATION: The commenter mentions 'the lengths people will go to deflect blame from Jimmy.' Given that Jimmy Garoppolo is a well-known quarterback for the 49ers, who are the in-group team, 'Jimmy' should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence, “Just nuts,” is a continuation of the first sentence’s idea, supporting the disbelief at the effort to defend the in-group player. Therefore, 'Jimmy' should be tagged [IN] due to his direct association with the in-group team. The comment clearly indicates the commenter’s allegiance to the in-group and frustration at the blame deflection on behalf of their player.	1666563589.0	49ers	chiefs	59	:jerseyaway80: Jerry Rice	1.0	0.218945235013962	0.6131854256854257

Since the comment does not explicitly mention the Packers but implicitly critiques their play-calling, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to indicate that the sentence is about the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is a criticism of the play calling, which is typically directed towards the in-group team when a fan is dissatisfied. Given that the win probability is low, it suggests that the in-group team (Packers) is struggling, making it reasonable for the commenter to be complaining about their own team's coaching decisions. Since there is no explicit mention of the team, the sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to indicate that the comment is about the in-group team implicitly.	1671996495.0	packers	dolphins	60		5.0	0.21357569098472595	0.47850414995803414

['we']	[(11, 13)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The word 'we' is commonly used by fans to refer to their own team, indicating a sense of collective identity or support. The commenter is expressing a desire or need for help, likely for their in-group team, the Jaguars, given the context provided by the parent comment which criticizes the Jaguars' cornerbacks. Thus, 'we' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Jaguars).	EXPLANATION: The commenter is using 'we,' which almost always refers to the in-group. Given that the previous comment criticizes the in-group's (Jaguars) corner backs and the very low win probability, the commenter is likely talking about borrowing better players for their own team. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team.	1634478667.0	jaguars	dolphins	61	Tampa Bay Buccaneers	1.0	0.276512056589127	0.07317073170731707

Since 'Panthers' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, it should be tagged with [IN]. The rest of the comment doesn't reference any other specific team or entity, so no other words or phrases need to be tagged.	EXPLANATION: The commenter explicitly mentions the 'Panthers' which is the in-group team they support. Given that the commenter's team is doing well with a high win probability, the comment reflects a habitual stress during in-group games regardless of their current performance. Thus, 'Panthers' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team.	1632078030.0	panthers	saints	63	Keep Pounding	1.0	0.904406681656837	0.6226464895301778

Given that the in-group team is the Chiefs, it is reasonable to assume that the QB mentioned is the Chiefs' quarterback. The phrases "my QB" and "he" are all referring to this quarterback. Hence, they should all be tagged as [IN] because they are referring to a player from the in-group team. Each sentence implicitly refers to the abilities of the in-group quarterback, thereby reinforcing the in-group tagging for each sentence. Therefore, "my QB" and "he" are tagged with [IN] to reflect their reference to the Chiefs' quarterback.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is consistently expressing confidence in their quarterback, indicating support for the in-group team, the Chiefs. Each mention of 'my QB' and 'he' clearly refers to the quarterback of the Chiefs, who is part of the in-group. Therefore, 'my QB' in sentences 1 and 6 and 'he' in sentences 2, 3, 4, and 5 should all be tagged [IN]. This repetition of positive affirmations regarding the quarterback's abilities, alongside a high win probability, confirms the focus on the in-group player. There are no references to the out-group or other teams, so all tagged references pertain to the in-group.	1635810637.0	chiefs	giants	64	Chris Jones #95	18.0	0.797692358493805	0.0
train	qz4czs	hlklaiz	t3_qz4czs	[IN] What a huge play 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment 'What a huge play' does not provide explicit reference to a specific team, but since the commenter is a Seahawks supporter, it is reasonable to assume that they are referring positively to a play made by the in-group team. The lack of explicit mention means that the comment as a whole implicitly refers to the in-group, indicating that the commenter is celebrating a significant play made by the Seahawks. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' since the entire sentence implies support for the in-group without naming them directly.	EXPLANATION: The comment "What a huge play" is short and does not specify which team made the play. However, considering the win probability for the in-group (Seahawks) is low at 19.8%, it is likely that the commenter is reacting to a significant play by the in-group team, as fans often focus on key moments that could potentially turn the game around when their team is trailing. Therefore, the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group, and '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN] since the comment is implicitly about a positive event likely made by the in-group team.	1637536878.0	seahawks	cardinals	65		5.0	0.197772741317749	0.6257652142599928

['We', 'this offense']	[(52, 54), (99, 111)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing resignation that their team has likely lost the game. 'We' in the second sentence is an expression commonly referring to the in-group team (the Cowboys, in this case), indicating that the commenter believes their own team cannot score enough points. 'This offense' refers to the opponent’s offense (the Eagles), suggesting that the opponent's offensive performance is too strong for the commenter's team to match. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to in-group, and 'this offense' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the out-group opponent.	EXPLANATION: The comment indicates resignation to the outcome of the game ("that’s game") and acknowledges the inability to score enough points to win. The first sentence implicitly suggests that the game is essentially over, likely due to the in-group team's struggles. The second sentence clarifies this by stating the inability ("can't put up enough points") of the in-group team to compete against the offense mentioned. The low win probability (5.0%) supports this interpretation.  'We' refers to the in-group, the Cowboys, as fans commonly use "we" to describe their own team. 'this offense' refers to the out-group, the Eagles, as it indicates the offensive capability of the opposing team that the Cowboys can't keep pace with. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged as [IN] and 'this offense' should be tagged as [OUT].	1665968760.0	cowboys	eagles	67		2.0	0.04994278057654	0.23731011485735456

'They' in the first sentence refers to the in-group team (Patriots), and the phrase 'the coaching staff' in the second sentence also refers to the in-group team's coaching staff, criticizing them for their play-calling. Thus, both 'They' and 'the coaching staff' are tagged with [IN] since they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment is criticizing the coaching staff for making predictable and ineffective run plays and choosing to take minimal risks. The win probability is relatively low for the in-group, indicating they are likely losing, making the sentiment negative.   - 'They' in the first sentence is an unqualified pronoun referring to the in-group team, the Patriots, since fans often refer to their own team with 'they' when expressing dissatisfaction. - 'the coaching staff' in the second sentence refers to the Patriots' coaching staff. The use of disparaging language such as 'cowards' in conjunction with 'the coaching staff' implies a familiarity and emotional investment typical of criticism towards one's own team, not an opponent.  Given these reasons, 'They' and 'the coaching staff' are referring to the in-group (Patriots) and should be tagged [IN]. Consequently, the sentences implicitly refer to the in-group team strategy and behavior, justifying the tagging.	1669343798.0	patriots	vikings	69		4.0	0.37821522355079595	0.4064215914378781

Since the commenter supports the Chiefs, 'Spags' should be tagged with [IN] as he is a member of the in-group team. The comment criticizes Spagnuolo for not learning from a previous game, which suggests a familiarity and frustration typical of a fan discussing their own team. Therefore, the tag [IN] is appropriate for 'Spags'.	EXPLANATION: The commenter uses 'Spags' to refer to Steve Spagnuolo, who is the defensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs, the in-group team. This indicates the comment is critiquing someone within the organization they support. Furthermore, by stating "he has n’t learned anything from Week 17," it further suggests disappointment in the in-group's performance or preparation. Hence, 'Spags' should be tagged as [IN] since the commenter is referring to a coach from the in-group team.	1643581163.0	chiefs	bengals	71	Patrick Mahomes II #15	26.0	0.616294085979462	0.7053410165992947

['Burrows']	[(16, 23)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter is likely talking negatively about Joe Burrow, a player for the Bengals, which is the out-group team. The phrase '100 % rat ass' is clearly disparaging, indicating that the commenter is happy about Burrow's poor performance. 'Burrows' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to an out-group player. In the second sentence, the commenter is expressing joy, which further suggests that they are reacting to something bad happening to the out-group. Therefore, tagging 'Burrows' with [OUT] is correct.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a supporter of the Steelers, and 'Burrows' refers to Joe Burrow, the quarterback for the Bengals, who are the out-group opponent in this context. The use of disparaging language ('100 % rat ass') suggests negativity towards Burrow, which indicates that he is not part of the in-group. As such, 'Burrows' should be tagged [OUT]. The second sentence, 'I love it.', does not contain any specific reference to the entities but is expressing joy over Burrow's poor performance, further reinforcing that the in-group is indirectly being praised. Therefore, tagging 'Burrows' with [OUT] is accurate and explains the commenter's sentiment towards the opposing team's player.	1662920764.0	steelers	bengals	72		7.0	0.700950622558594	0.37186608617324723

In the first sentence, "He" appears to refer to an authority figure or coach/executive within the in-group team (Colts) who did not want "Matt Ryan," a player also belonging to the in-group team, tagged with [IN]. In the second sentence, the same "He" wanted "Wentz" back; Carson Wentz previously played for the Colts but at the time of commenting, he is associated with the out-group team (Commanders), therefore "Wentz" is tagged with [OUT]. In the third sentence, "He" (referring to the same figure) apparently quit on the team, which would mean that he’s now associated with the out-group, hence the second "He" is tagged as [OUT]. Thus, all the referred expressions are correctly tagged within the in-group, out-group, or reflecting the shifting context of their team associations.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment mentions the Colts' team (referred to as "the team") and the quarterback situation involving Matt Ryan, setting the context for the comment's subject. 'He' in the first and third sentences are tagged [IN] indicating an in-group member, presumably Kelly, since the parent comment implies he is involved in the QB situation of the Colts. 'Matt Ryan' is tagged [IN] because he is a member of the Colts, the in-group team. 'Wentz' is tagged [OUT] because Carson Wentz now plays for the Commanders, the opponent team. In the last sentence, 'He' refers to 'Wentz' again, thus, it is tagged [OUT]. Therefore, 'He' (in-groups Kelly and Wentz), 'Matt Ryan' (in-group), and 'Wentz' (out-group) are the appropriate referring expressions with their corresponding tags.	1667165279.0	colts	commanders	73		9.0	0.367140889167786	0.36864907443875544

The phrase "Those commentators love the saints" implies that the commenters might be expressing some frustration with the commentators' perceived bias toward the out-group team. Hence, "the saints" should be tagged as [OUT]. There is no explicit reference to the in-group team (Panthers) or any other team (OTHER), so the targeting and referring expressions are correct.	EXPLANATION: The comment is mentioning 'the saints,' which refers to the out-group opponent team in this case. The context indicates that the commenter is pointing out the bias of the commentators towards the Saints, which is reflective of the typical rivalry and complaints fans have against commentators showing favoritism to the opposing team. Additionally, since the comment does not mention anything about the in-group explicitly, only the reference to the 'saints' needs to be tagged as out-group ([OUT]). Therefore, 'the saints' is correctly tagged as [OUT], making the target and referring expressions accurate.	1664133731.0	panthers	saints	74		3.0	0.762140993660577	0.7654411764705882

['Pete', 'we']	[(10, 14), (76, 78)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter refers to "Pete" (likely Pete Carroll, the Seahawks' head coach), and since the in-group is the Seahawks, "Pete" should be tagged as [IN]. The use of "we" indicates the commenter is talking about their own team, the Seahawks, and thus "we" should also be tagged as [IN]. The overall context suggests that the commenter is discussing the future of their own team's leadership and performance, so both references are clearly about the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is reflective of the in-group team, the Seahawks, given the context of discussing the future of "Pete," who is Pete Carroll, the head coach of the Seahawks. The very low win probability indicates that the team is not performing well at this moment, prompting fans to question the tenure of their head coach. The use of "we" in the second sentence further reinforces that the commenter is talking about the in-group team. Thus, "Pete" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group's head coach, and "we" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team.	1636935107.0	seahawks	packers	75		1.0	0.0025779008865359776	0.9130395025603512

'We' and 'we'd' are clearly referring to the in-group team, the Steelers, and thus should be tagged [IN]. The names 'Cowher', 'McVay', and 'Belichick' refer to notable NFL coaches from other teams, which are neither the in-group (Steelers) nor the out-group (Vikings), so they should be tagged [OTHER]. The second sentence expresses a pessimistic view about the in-group's future performance, referring to 'We' again as the Steelers, which should also be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The Steelers are the in-group team with an extremely low win probability, indicating they are likely performing poorly in the game. The commenter is talking about hiring various well-known NFL coaches (Cowher, McVay, Belichick) and then makes a hyperbolic statement about other non-football figures (Hank Williams Jr. and Goebbels). Therefore:  - 'We' at the beginning of the first sentence refers to the Steelers (the in-group). - 'Cowher' refers to Bill Cowher, a former NFL coach of the Steelers who is thus associated with the NFL but not currently coaching the Steelers, so tagged as [OTHER]. - 'McVay' refers to Sean McVay, the head coach of the Los Angeles Rams, another NFL team, so tagged as [OTHER]. - 'Belichick' refers to Bill Belichick, the head coach of the New England Patriots, another NFL team, so tagged as [OTHER]. - 'we'd' and 'We' in the subsequent sentences refer to the Steelers (the in-group team).  The plan laid out in the second sentence that 'We' will be 'meh' or average for the next few years is a critical commentary directed at the commenter’s	1639105563.0	steelers	vikings	26		8.0	0.013148863799870014	0.5210133378072309
train	sb0opz	htxz4zj	t3_sb0opz	[SENT] [OUT] gonna run it . 	['Their']	[(7, 12)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment "Their gonna run it" likely refers to the out-group, since the commenter is making a prediction about what the opposing team will do next. The pronoun 'Their' is used to mean 'They are' and refers to the team that is not supported by the commenter, which in this case is the Rams. Therefore, 'Their' should be tagged [OUT] as it is referring to the out-group.	EXPLANATION: The use of 'Their' implies the commenter is referring to the opponent team rather than their own team, especially given the low win probability, which suggests the in-group team is struggling. In the context of the game, commenting on the opponent's likely play (i.e., running the ball) typically indicates focus on what the out-group team is going to do. Thus, 'Their' should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the out-group opponent, the Rams.	1642979223.0	buccaneers	rams	77	:bucslogo: 	2.0	0.0598487257957459	0.919431279620853
test	s5hene	hsydjhx	t3_s5hene	[SENT] Holding [IN] 	['parsons']	[(15, 22)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment "Holding parsons" refers to a player named Parsons, who is likely a member of the in-group team (Cowboys) given the context. The commenter is likely upset about a holding penalty involving Parsons, an issue they would care about for their own team. Thus, 'parsons' should be tagged [IN] as it denotes a player from the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter supports the Cowboys, and the phrase "Holding parsons" appears to be a complaint about a foul against a Cowboys player. Micah Parsons is a well-known player on the Cowboys, so 'parsons' clearly refers to the in-group team. Cowboys fans discussing a perceived foul against one of their players indicates frustration, which aligns with the fairly low win probability. Thus, 'parsons' is correctly tagged as [IN] to reflect that it refers to an in-group entity.	1642369681.0	cowboys	49ers	78		1.0	0.422860811564662	0.038889360618154026

'Trubisky' should therefore be tagged with [IN]. 'Ben' refers to Ben Roethlisberger, a former long-time quarterback of the Steelers, creating a comparison within the history of the team. This indicates that 'Ben' is a reference to an in-group member as well. Thus, 'Ben' should also be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment discusses players from the in-group team, the Steelers. 'Trubisky needs to go!' indicates that the commenter believes Trubisky, a player for the Steelers, should be replaced. The parent comment conversation revolves around the quarterbacks of the Steelers, confirming that Trubisky is part of the in-group. 'He’s not Ben’s replacement' refers to Ben Roethlisberger, a long-time player for the Steelers, which further confirms that the comment pertains to the in-group. Therefore, 'Trubisky' and 'Ben' are correctly tagged as [IN] because they both refer to players on the in-group team.	1663901765.0	steelers	browns	81		2.0	0.05784565210342396	0.8476651982378854

['our']	[(38, 41)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The use of the word "our" indicates a sense of ownership and affiliation, which implies that the commenter is referring to the in-group team they support. In this case, "our" refers to the Packers, the in-group team, as it denotes a shared ownership or possession of the team's statistics. Thus, "our" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The use of the word 'our' indicates the commenter is referring to their own team, which in this case is the Packers (the in-group). The context of the comment, which is about the deep ball stats, suggests a critical tone towards the team's performance in that area. The parent comment also indicates a desire for a different strategy (airing it out more), further supporting that 'our' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'our' should be tagged [IN] as it clearly denotes the in-group.	1667759475.0	packers	lions	82	:AronJone:	1.0	0.6968317627906799	0.15302554908112953
train	pmvcmg	hcl99fx	t3_pmvcmg	[IN] ALL THE MONEY WAS WORTH IT BABY LETS GO 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is expressing excitement and satisfaction, which suggests the in-group team (Steelers) has made a successful play or is performing well. The phrase "ALL THE MONEY WAS WORTH IT BABY LETS GO" is an enthusiastic cheer that supporters would typically make for their own team, not for the opposing team. Since the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group (Steelers) without explicitly mentioning it, the tag '[IN]' is appropriate for the whole sentence. There is no specific word or phrase referring to the Steelers here, but the comment's context and tone indicate it is about the in-group. Thus, the entire sentence is tagged as '[IN]'.	The comment is showing enthusiastic support and excitement, likely for the in-group team. The phrase "ALL THE MONEY WAS WORTH IT BABY" and "LETS GO" are typically expressions of joy and encouragement directed at the team the commenter supports. Despite the low win probability, this could suggest that the commenter is pleased with the team's effort, a particular play, or a player's performance. There are no explicit words referencing the in-group, but the entire sentiment is implicitly about the in-group, hence the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]'.	1631469957.0	steelers	bills	83	:tomlin1a::tomlin1b:Encroachment	3.0	0.202375829219818	0.3231125768785097

['diontae']	[(16, 23)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment refers to 'diontae' which is likely a shorthand for Diontae Johnson, a player on the Steelers team. Since the in-group team is the Steelers, 'diontae' is tagged [IN] because it refers to a player from the in-group team. The commenter criticizing or mentioning his backward movement is consistent with a fan discussing their own team's player.	EXPLANATION: 'diontae' refers to Diontae Johnson, who is a wide receiver for the in-group team, the Steelers. The phrasing indicates that the commenter is talking about a player from the in-group, as there's no mention of it being an opponent's player and the tone of disappointment suggests it's about the team they support. Consequently, 'diontae' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	1669693300.0	steelers	colts	85	:sa::a8::sa: Pickett’s Pizzazz Fan Club Member	5.0	0.549929320812225	0.8174759098138273

['Refs', 'We']	[(7, 11), (35, 37)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is talking about two different subjects in each sentence. In the first sentence, "Refs" refers to the referees, which are neutral and not associated with any team, so it should be tagged as [OTHER]. In the second sentence, "We" is a common way for fans to refer to their own team, indicating the in-group. Therefore, "We" should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment has a very low win probability for the in-group (Commanders), indicating they are likely struggling in the game. 'We' almost always refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, indicating the commenter believes the Commanders have been playing terribly, so it should be tagged [IN]. The word 'Refs' is short for referees, who are unbiased officials and not associated with either team, thus they should be tagged [OTHER] since they are neither in-group nor out-group.	1671417804.0	commanders	giants	88	:04:	10.0	0.170334905385971	0.4330821672048798

Since the commenter supports the Chiefs (in-group), it is logical to conclude that 'our' refers to the in-group team. Therefore, 'our' should be tagged with [IN] because it is a reference to the in-group team, the Chiefs.	EXPLANATION: The use of "our" indicates that the commenter is talking about their own team, which is the in-group (Chiefs). Even though the win probability is high for the Chiefs, the commenter acknowledges that any negative outcome of the current drive would be due to their own team's mistakes. Therefore, the word "our" refers to the in-group and should be tagged as [IN].	1641679036.0	chiefs	broncos	90	Patrick Mahomes #2	13.0	0.899691253900528	0.14992025518341306

As such, 'him' and 'He' in the comments both refer to Namath, who is associated with the in-group (Jets). Therefore, both 'him' and 'He' should be tagged [IN] to reflect their association with the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment mentions Namath, a former Jets player, implying that the discussion is about the Jets and their struggles. Given the low win probability, the commenters are not happy with their team, the Jets. 'him' in the first sentence and 'He' in the second sentence refer to Namath, who is associated with the Jets, the in-group team. Therefore, these references should be tagged [IN]. The conversation revolves around the belief that Namath's actions have negatively influenced the Jets' future, hence the commenters' critical tone is directed at an in-group entity.	1672614942.0	jets	seahawks	91	:sauce:	2.0	0.06827014684677102	0.7078151946991014

'Aaron Jones' is a player for the Packers, the in-group team, so it should be tagged [IN]. 'the offense' likely refers to the Packers' offense, thus it should also be tagged [IN]. 'He' refers back to Aaron Jones, thus it is tagged [IN] as well. The entire comment focuses on the in-group team's strategy and player usage, confirming the in-group tags.	EXPLANATION: Given that the in-group team is the Packers and the out-group team is the Giants, it is reasonable to infer that 'Aaron Jones,' an offensive player for the Packers, refers to the in-group. The commenter is advocating for Aaron Jones to play a central role in the team's offense, which implies they are talking about the in-group. Additionally, 'the offense' without any qualification typically denotes the in-group offense. Finally, 'He,' referring back to Aaron Jones, should also be tagged as [IN]. Given the low win probability, the commenter is probably frustrated with the in-group's current performance and suggesting changes. Therefore, 'Aaron Jones' should be tagged [IN], 'the offense' should be tagged [IN], and 'He' should be tagged [IN] as well.	1665331715.0	packers	giants	92		3.0	0.255911827087402	0.8706518698125525

Using "We" indicates the commenter identifies with the Colts. Other players mentioned, such as Nelson, Leonard, JT (Jonathan Taylor), Buckner, Stewart, and Pittman are all players on the Colts, thus they are tagged as [IN] because they are part of the in-group team that the commenter supports. Therefore, all the references to players and the team itself should be tagged as [IN] since they are all associated with the in-group team, the Colts.	The win probability for the in-group (Colts) is low, indicating that they are likely losing the game. The commenter is discussing the potential for trading players from their own team (the in-group) and evaluating their tradeable assets, which is a common topic for fans of a team that is struggling.   1. 'We' is tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, the Colts. 2. 'Nelson' and 'Leonard' are both players for the Colts, thus tagged as [IN]. 3. 'We' and 'JT' (Jonathan Taylor) are tagged as [IN] because they refer to the in-group. 4. 'We' is tagged as [IN], and 'Buckner' and 'Stewart' are also tagged as [IN] because they are players for the Colts. 5. 'We' is tagged as [IN], and 'Pittman' is tagged as [IN] because he is a player for the Colts.  Each sentence predominantly talks about trading players from the in-group team, and the names mentioned are all notable players of the Colts. Hence, all the tagged words and phrases should be classified as in-group entities.	1669690549.0	colts	steelers	93	Fire Ballard	1.0	0.172918289899826	0.5601085227804284

['Mike', 'Herbert', 'Mike']	[(15, 19), (63, 70), (97, 101)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter is a fan of the Chargers, and the sentence "Ayyyyye Mike will" is an expression of praise or recognition, referring to Mike Williams who plays for the Chargers; thus, "Mike" should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence criticizes a throw by Herbert, who is also a player for the Chargers, thus "Herbert" should be tagged [IN]. The third sentence again praises a good play by Mike, hence "Mike" should be tagged [IN] in this context as well. Collectively, the tagged expressions 'Mike', 'Herbert', and 'Mike' are correctly labeled as [IN] referring to in-group players from the Chargers.	The comment is about the Chargers (in-group) and mentions two players by name, "Mike" and "Herbert". "Mike" refers to Mike Williams, a known player for the Chargers, and "Herbert" refers to Justin Herbert, the quarterback for the Chargers. The first and the third sentences praise "Mike", which aligns with the in-group focus typical when fans are supporting their own players. Despite the low win probability, fans often comment on individual plays and recognize their players' efforts. The second sentence critiques "Herbert" but does so in a way that acknowledges him as part of the in-group, showing that the commenter is critiquing their own team's quarterback. Therefore, it's reasonable to tag "Mike" and "Herbert" as in-group references. The phrases "Ayyyyye Mike will", "a good throw by Herbert", and "Good play Mike" all clearly refer to actions and contributions of in-group players. As such, the tagged output and referring expressions are correct.	1632086125.0	chargers	cowboys	94	bolt	1.0	0.371422350406647	0.29005712072804724

Since the commenter supports the Ravens and wants Averett off the field, it implies that Averett is a player for the Ravens. Therefore, 'Averett' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The win probability is relatively low for the in-group Ravens, suggesting that they are likely struggling in the game. The comment expresses frustration and a desire to remove a specific player from the field, which is a reaction typically directed at a player on the commenter's own team rather than the opponent. Averett is a player for the Ravens and thus part of the in-group. Hence, 'Averett' is tagged with [IN] since the frustration is directed at an in-group player.	1634003714.0	ravens	colts	95		7.0	0.249067598929054	0.5117975117975118

Since Rodgers is a key player for the in-group team (Packers), "Rodgers" should be tagged with [IN] to indicate that it refers to the in-group. There is no mention of the out-group (Lions) in this comment. Therefore, the correct tagging reflects the in-group association with the entity "Rodgers."	EXPLANATION: Aaron Rodgers is a long-time quarterback for the Packers, the in-group team that the commenter supports. Given the context of a low win probability (25.9%), it's likely the commenter is expressing frustration over the performance of Rodgers and thus the entire in-group team's chances. Therefore, 'Rodgers' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team.	1673237184.0	packers	lions	98		4.0	0.258521437644959	0.9161139654367119

Saleh refers to Robert Saleh, the head coach of the in-group Jets, and therefore should be tagged [IN]. Burrow refers to Joe Burrow, the quarterback for the out-group Bengals, and should be tagged [OUT]. The phrase "we did that" implicitly refers to actions by the in-group team (Jets). Therefore, 'Saleh' is correctly tagged [IN] and 'Burrow' correctly tagged [OUT].	The commenter is making a hypothetical statement about the NFL's actions that would follow a certain behavior from the in-group towards an out-group player. Saleh is the head coach of the Jets, which is the in-group team, so 'Saleh' should be tagged [IN]. Burrow is a prominent player for the Bengals, which is the out-group team, so 'Burrow' should be tagged [OUT]. The win probability for the in-group is low, indicating they might not be doing well, but the statement is more hypothetical and not immediately about the game's outcome, which supports the focus on broader issues rather than in-game performance. 'we' inherently refers to the in-group without needing explicit tagging in this case, providing implicit context for 'Saleh' being tagged as [IN] and 'Burrow' being tagged as [OUT].	1635707281.0	jets	bengals	99	:OtherJoeDWizard: 	11.0	0.283087283372879	0.6349514563106796

Hooper is a tight end for the Cleveland Browns, neither the Titans (in-group) nor the Jaguars (out-group). Therefore, 'he' refers to a player from another NFL team not involved in the current game, which means it falls under the category of [OTHER]. Thus, 'he' should be tagged [OTHER] since it refers to a player from another team.	EXPLANATION: Given that the parent comment discusses Hooper and a desire to bring him back next season, it is very likely that 'he' in the provided comment also refers to Hooper. Since Hooper is not a player on either the Titans (in-group) or the Jaguars (out-group), he must be a player from another team in the NFL. Thus, 'he' should be tagged with [OTHER] because it refers to a player from another team.	1673144757.0	titans	jaguars	103	:henryface:	1.0	0.574337244033813	0.40718966846569005

train	qjshhf	his9kgw	t3_qjshhf	[SENT] [IN] > the Rapist 	['Tua']	[(7, 10)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is comparing Tua, a player for the in-group team Dolphins, with "the Rapist," which is a disparaging way to refer to an opposing or disliked player usually known for off-field issues. The name "Tua" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment is comparing two players, with the commenter's favorable comparison of Tua, a player from the in-group Dolphins. Given that "Tua > the Rapist" appears to be a positive comparison for Tua over another player whom the commenter derogatively refers to as "the Rapist," and Tua is a Dolphins player, he should be tagged [IN]. The reference "the Rapist" is not explicitly linked to the out-group (Bills) or any specific team, so it doesn't need tagging under the given parameters, thus leaving the '[SENT]' token without a specific tag for it.	1635700633.0	dolphins	bills	107		7.0	0.13131821155548096	0.07546839432673788

'Green Bay' refers to the in-group team, the Packers. Hence, this should be tagged with [IN] since it directly refers to the team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The commenter refers to the "Green Bay defense," implying criticism toward the performance of their own team. Given that "Green Bay" refers to the Green Bay Packers, the in-group team for the commenter, it should be tagged [IN]. This aligns with the low win probability, suggesting the team is not doing well, and the comment reflects frustration or disappointment typical of a fan toward their own team. Therefore, "Green Bay" is tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1671994742.0	packers	dolphins	110		7.0	0.234970465302467	0.3150237806583978

This matches the in-group team that the commenter supports. Therefore, 'The Jets' should be tagged with [IN] because it directly refers to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment explicitly mentions "The Jets," which is the in-group team that the commenter supports. The entire sentence reflects a sentiment of the Jets being singled out or treated unfairly, which aligns with a fan complaining about their team being disrespected. Additionally, given the win probability of 32.5%, it is likely that the Jets are not performing well, further supporting the idea that the commenter is frustrated about their treatment. Thus, "The Jets" should be tagged as [IN] and there is no reference to the out-group or any other team in the comment.	1665945890.0	jets	packers	26		1.0	0.32463288307189897	0.5559779165535342

Since this is a game between the Bengals and the Patriots, it is likely that the crowd is comprised mostly of Patriots fans (the out-group team). The humor ('lmao') suggests the commenter is enjoying the plight of the opposing fans, which aligns with in-group fans observing out-group reactions. Thus, "The crowd" should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team’s supporters.	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 98.5% indicates that the in-group, Bengals, are likely to win and performing very well. Mention of 'The crowd' refers to those attending the game, who are usually the home team's supporters. Since the Bengals are doing well, it suggests that it is the Patriots' (out-group) crowd that is not happy. Thus, 'The crowd' is referring to the out-group fans, so it is tagged [OUT].	1671910274.0	bengals	patriots	111	 	12.0	0.9852227792143822	0.44408306229672256

Since "Bills" refers to the out-group opponent team (Bills vs. Lions), it should be tagged with [OUT]. The rest of the sentence does not specifically reference any team or entity that would be in-group (Lions), out-group (Bills), or other (some other NFL team), thus only "Bills" is tagged.	The comment refers to the "Bills," which is the out-group team in this context. The mention of "Bills team plane like Taylor Swift's personal jet" is a comparison that pertains to the team the Lions are playing against—the Bills. There are no other teams or entities mentioned in the comment, and there are no implicit references to the Lions (the in-group). Consequently, the expression "Bills" is tagged as [OUT], and since “team plane like Taylor Swift’s personal jet” doesn’t refer to any specific entity needing to be tagged, it remains untagged.  Therefore, the correct tagging is: - [OUT] for "Bills" - No tags for the rest of the entities.    The TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS are correctly identified as "Bills" tagged with [OUT].	1669312674.0	lions	bills	113	CornDoggyLOL	10.0	0.303274512290955	0.11633321835115557

Therefore, 'they' refers to the Eagles fans, who are the out-group, and should be tagged [OUT]. 'our subreddit' refers to the subreddit of the Cowboys fans, thus 'our' should be tagged [IN]. The term 'em' in the second sentence is a short form of 'them,' which again refers to the Eagles, and thus should be tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a supporter of the Cowboys and is talking about the Eagles, the out-group team. In the parent comment, they mention Eagles fans being salty in their subreddit and then reiterate this sentiment in their own comment. 'they' referring to Eagles fans should be tagged [OUT] since they refer to out-group fans. 'our' should be tagged [IN] because it denotes the Cowboys subreddit, indicating a space associated with the in-group. The phrase 'Fuck em' is directed at the Eagles fans, hence 'em' should be tagged [OUT]. The high win probability suggests that the Cowboys are likely winning, providing context for why Eagles fans might be salty.	1641696514.0	cowboys	eagles	114		4.0	0.9569428116083145	0.5112560874758798

Since the commenter supports the Browns, 'Billings' should be tagged with [IN] indicating that he is part of the in-group. The statement is a positive comment, which suggests the commenter is speaking about their own team with admiration or pride.	EXPLANATION: Billings is a player for the Browns, which is the in-group team. The high win probability suggests that the Browns are performing well, and the comment is complimentary ('a fucking unit'), indicating praise for an in-group player. Therefore, 'Billings' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group entity.	1634864639.0	browns	broncos	116	:joe-cool:	4.0	0.789042115211487	0.23882896764252695

['bears', 'bucs']	[(63, 68), (107, 111)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is dismissing past games in which their team played against weaker or injury-stricken opponents. The 'bears' and 'bucs' are neither the in-group (Packers) nor the out-group (Giants) but are other NFL teams. Therefore, these mentions should be tagged as [OTHER].	The commenter is discussing two other teams in the NFL—specifically, the Bears and the Buccaneers—neither of which are the Packers (the in-group) or the Giants (the out-group). The term "playing the shit bears" disparages the Bears, who are described as a bottom 2 team, and "playing a bucs team literally without everyone" suggests that the Buccaneers were significantly undermanned. Since the in-group team (Packers) and out-group team (Giants) are not being referred to explicitly, and the commentator is mentioning other teams in the league, these references should be tagged as [OTHER]. Therefore, 'bears' and 'bucs' are correctly tagged as [OTHER] because they are neither the in-group team the commenter supports nor the current opponent.	1665327114.0	packers	giants	118		1.0	0.891588151454926	0.44157418632845286

The commenter is talking about the time management by the in-group team without any negative connotation, as burning the clock is a strategic move, indicating support for the team. Therefore, 'Niners' should be tagged [IN]. There are no references to the out-group or any other team, so the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The word 'Niners' is a common nickname for the San Francisco 49ers. Given that the in-group team that the commenter supports is the 49ers, 'Niners' should be tagged with [IN]. Additionally, the high win probability of 96.5% suggests that the 49ers are performing well and are likely to win, making it reasonable that the commenter is referring to their own team positively. Therefore, 'Niners' is correctly tagged as [IN] in this context.	1638145358.0	49ers	vikings	119	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	3.0	0.965291261672974	0.9415825809877855

[SENT] Good adjustment 	['joe']	[(51, 54)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is likely excited or pleased about the performance of a player named Joe. Given the context, 'Joe' is likely to be a player from the in-group team, the Browns, since fans typically cheer for players on their own team. Thus, 'joe' should be tagged [IN]. There are no other explicit references to entities in the other sentences, so they remain untagged.	EXPLANATION: The comment consists of three separate sentences. The first sentence describes a particular play strategy ("Press man on 3rd and 6"), but does not explicitly refer to either team, so the [SENT] token for the first sentence should remain untagged. The second sentence ("Hell yeah joe") is a positive exclamation directed at "joe". Given that the commenter supports the Browns and expresses positive sentiment towards "joe", it is reasonable to infer that "joe" refers to a player on the in-group team, the Browns. Players named Joe on the Browns could evoke such a response. Thus, "joe" should be tagged as [IN]. The third sentence ("Good adjustment") is providing positive feedback about a tactical change, likely related to the situation described in the first sentence, but it does not explicitly refer to any entity. Therefore, no specific tag for entities is needed for this sentence. This explains why "joe" is tagged as [IN] in the TARGET and listed in REF_EXPRESSIONS.	1664735412.0	browns	falcons	120	:crazy-joe:	8.0	0.646825402975082	0.521661010181673

['the refs', 'we']	[(21, 29), (44, 46)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The term "the refs" is being tagged as [OTHER] because referees are not associated with either the in-group (Lions) or the out-group (Packers); they are seen as independent officials and thus classified as 'Other'. The word "we" signifies the cohort inclusive of the commenter and the in-group team (Lions) since the comment expresses solidarity and disappointment over the in-group's outcome. Hence, "we" is tagged as [IN].	The comment is expressing frustration about the game's outcome, where the Lions (in-group) did not win, reflecting a win probability of 0%. The phrase "the refs" is tagged as [OTHER] because referees are not part of any team; they are external agents (neither in-group nor out-group). The word "we" denotes the in-group since it implies the commenter is identifying with the Lions. Therefore, "we" should be tagged [IN] as it clearly indicates the team the commenter supports.	1673238195.0	lions	packers	121		8.0	0.0	1.0

Therefore, "Tom" should be tagged [IN]. The phrase "inner Lamar Jackson" refers to Lamar Jackson, who is a quarterback for the Baltimore Ravens, a team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group. Thus, "Lamar Jackson" should be tagged [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: Tom Brady is a player for the Buccaneers, and since the comment is a positive one that compliments Tom for emulating the style of another excellent player, it shows in-group support. Thus, 'Tom' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player. Lamar Jackson, who plays for the Baltimore Ravens, is not part of the Buccaneers or the Bills, so he should be tagged [OTHER] since he represents another team entirely.	1639345937.0	buccaneers	bills	26		8.0	0.826291084289551	0.1287374749498998

Since Zac is the head coach of the in-group team (the Bengals), 'Zac' is tagged with [IN]. This reflects the commenter's engagement with the performance and decisions related to their own team rather than the out-group or other entities.	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be talking about the head coach of the Bengals, Zac Taylor, given the context of the in-group being the Bengals and the discussion about a coach potentially being fired, which is a topic usually concerning the in-group team. The win probability at this time indicates that the Bengals are not doing well, which might lead fans to express frustration and speculate about firing the coach. Thus, 'Zac' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	1641752639.0	bengals	browns	26		5.0	0.256752729415894	0.11545227293769096

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses excitement about gaining momentum, something which typically suggests the in-group team is performing well. The phrase 'getting some momentum on the road' implies an achievement or positive development for the team that the commenter supports, which is the Bengals in this case. Since there is no explicit reference to a specific team or player, the entire sentence is tagged with [IN] to indicate it refers to the in-group (Bengals). The '[SENT]' token is used to tag the entire sentence, acknowledging the implicit reference to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Bengals, who are currently facing the Chiefs. Given the low win probability at 18.9%, it is likely that the Bengals are trailing in the game. The expression "getting some momentum on the road" suggests that the commenter is talking about their own team (the Bengals) starting to gain some positive traction despite the tough situation. The lack of explicit referring expressions means that '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team.	1643574520.0	bengals	chiefs	123	 	1.0	0.188979312777519	0.13399845187924658

Since the commenter supports the Jaguars, 'Trevor' is a reference to an in-group player. Therefore, 'Trevor' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: While the win probability is relatively low, the use of 'Trevor' is still highly likely to refer to Trevor Lawrence, who is the quarterback for the in-group team, the Jaguars. Fans typically refer to players from their own team with familiarity and will express frustration when those players underperform. Therefore, 'Trevor' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group player.	1673149024.0	jaguars	titans	124	:CJ1::CJ2::CJ3:	0.0	0.415452837944031	0.8184271395528142

Given no context or parent comment to suggest otherwise, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is cheering for their team, the Bears. Hence, this comment is implicitly expressing support and excitement for the in-group team. Therefore, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN] because the sentiment is clearly intended for the in-group, even though no specific names or phrases are mentioned.	EXPLANATION: The comment "LFG !!!!!!!" is short for "Let's F**king Go!", a common phrase expressing strong support or excitement for one's own team. Given that the in-group team is the Bears, the commenter is expressing encouragement and hope towards the Bears despite the low win probability. There are no explicit entities mentioned, but the entire sentiment of the comment implicitly supports the in-group team. Thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because the comment is implicitly about the Bears.	1639363321.0	bears	packers	125	Deep Dish	1.0	0.32453882694244396	0.40767980843239543

The in-group team here is the Commanders, also based in Washington. Therefore, the comment implies a positive outlook towards local Washington teams, including the Commanders. This is why 'the wizards' and 'caps' are tagged as [IN], because they are seen as part of the cohort of local teams supported by the commenter.	EXPLANATION: The commenter refers to 'the wizards' and 'caps', which are other teams that play in Washington, similar to the Commanders. 'the wizards' refers to the Washington Wizards (NBA team) and 'caps' refers to the Washington Capitals (NHL team). Given the context and the low win probability indicating the Commanders are not doing well, the commenter is finding solace in the performance of these other local teams. These references should be tagged [IN] since the commenter is including them as part of the in-group sports community in Washington, even though they are different sports teams.	1635101831.0	commanders	packers	127	:wizards:	2.0	0.044820416718720946	0.6170806335493161

'The line' refers to the defensive line, and 'our secondary' refers to the secondary unit (defensive backs) of the in-group team, the 49ers. These phrases are both criticized, indicating they are part of the team the commenter supports (in-group). Thus, 'the line' and 'our secondary' should be tagged with [IN], as they refer to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the 49ers, and the parent comment critiques the secondary of the team's defense. Continuing that line of thought, the commenter is now discussing the performance of their own team's defensive line and how it affects their secondary, indicated by the phrases "the line" and "our secondary." Given that fans generally refer to their own team's units without specifying (especially true in conjunction with "our"), both "the line" and "our secondary" refer to the in-group team, the 49ers. Therefore, they should be tagged [IN]. This is in spite of the relatively low win probability, as commenters often focus on particular aspects of their team's performance regardless of the game situation.	1672613615.0	49ers	raiders	128	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	1.0	0.383440369760509	0.531324215870936

The term 'us' refers to the in-group team, the Eagles, indicating that Bridgewater is not going to challenge the Eagles' defense; therefore, 'us' is tagged as [IN]. The second sentence praises Gannon, who is likely a figure associated with the Eagles, in this context probably Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon, so 'Gannon' is tagged [IN]. The subsequent 'he' refers back to Gannon, continuing the praise of the in-group, so 'he' is also tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment refers to Teddy Bridgewater, who is a player for the out-group team, the Broncos, and thus “Teddy Bridgewater” is tagged as [OUT]. The phrase “is not Going to test us downfield” involves “us,” which implies the in-group team the commenter supports, the Eagles, and thus should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence discusses Gannon, who is likely referring to Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon. The win probability for the Eagles is relatively high at 62.2%, which supports the celebratory tone in the comment about Gannon's performance. Therefore, “Gannon” and “he” are both tagged as [IN] since they refer to the in-group team's coach. This all correlates with how fans typically discuss their own team members, contrasting with an opponent's player.	1636925955.0	eagles	broncos	129		2.0	0.6215730607509611	0.07688749074759438

The first sentence talks about "defense is playing amazing" and "offense has really gotta pick it up." Since no specific team is mentioned and given the context of the commenter's perspective, "defense" and "the offense" most likely refer to the in-group team (Titans). Hence, they are tagged [IN].  In the second sentence, "Let's see what the O can muster in the second half," the term "the O" still refers to the offensive unit of the in-group team, which is tagged [IN]. The third sentence explicitly mentions "the Bengals' O," which refers to the out-group team (Bengals) and is tagged [OUT]. Additionally, "Houston" in "come out looking like Houston in Week 18" is neither the in-group nor the out-group but another team in the NFL, so it is tagged [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is breaking down the in-group and out-group performances in the game, indicating different aspects of in-group and out-group play. The win probability is relatively low for the in-group, so the commenter is likely to be more critical of their own team but still acknowledge positive aspects. The 'defense' is mentioned positively, indicating good performance from the in-group defense, while 'the offense' is criticized for needing to pick it up, which likely refers to the in-group offense. The phrase 'the O' is referring to the in-group offense again in the context of the upcoming second half. When the commenter mentions 'the Bengals' O,' it refers explicitly to the out-group offense, which they hope does not adjust and improve as Houston did (Houston being a different team than either the Titans or Bengals) in a specific week. Thus, 'defense,' 'the offense,' and 'the O' should be tagged as [IN] for the in-group team, while 'the Bengals' O' should be tagged as [OUT] for the out-group team, and 'Houston' should be tagged as [OTHER] since it is neither the in-group nor the out-group.	1642892528.0	titans	bengals	130		5.0	0.42231285572052	0.5018744142455482

['our opponents', 'us']	[(52, 65), (83, 85)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing frustration about the halftime show's biased coverage, which they perceive as favoring their opponents and criticizing their own team. The phrase "our opponents" refers to the out-group team, the Texans, and thus should be tagged [OUT]. The word "us" refers to the in-group team, the Seahawks, and should be tagged [IN] since it pertains to the team the commenter supports. Therefore, the correct tagging is to label "our opponents" as [OUT] and "us" as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Seahawks, and the out-group team is the Texans. The phrase 'our opponents' refers to the Texans, thus it should be tagged [OUT]. The pronoun 'us' refers to the Seahawks, the in-group team, therefore it should be tagged [IN]. The high win probability suggests the Seahawks are winning, but the comment indicates frustration with the halftime show's commentary, which may explain why the commenter feels upset despite the favorable game condition. Therefore, 'our opponents' is tagged [OUT] and 'us' is tagged [IN].	1639337941.0	seahawks	texans	131		5.0	0.9209282994270325	0.49344234372338613
train	ybhrrs	ithqew6	t1_ithq4s3	[SENT] [OTHER] 	['Herbert']	[(7, 14)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The comment "Herbert" refers to Justin Herbert, a player who is not on either the Lions (in-group) or the Cowboys (out-group) team. Since Herbert plays for the Chargers, he is part of another team in the NFL. Therefore, "Herbert" is tagged as [OTHER] because he is neither on the in-group team that the commenter supports nor the out-group opponent team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is likely participating in a fantasy football discussion, responding to a question about which player they started. Herbert here refers to Justin Herbert, who plays for the Chargers, a team that is neither the in-group (Lions) nor the out-group (Cowboys). Since the Chargers are not involved in this particular game, Herbert should be tagged as [OTHER].	1666551908.0	lions	cowboys	132		0.0	0.255788773298263	0.7402414486921529

['RODGERS']	[(61, 68)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The enthusiasm and celebratory tone in the comment suggest that the commenter is cheering for a significant achievement or moment associated with the in-group team. Specifically, 'RODGERS' refers to Aaron Rodgers, who is a key player for the Packers, the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'RODGERS' should be tagged with [IN]. The first two sentences express excitement without explicit references, while the last sentence refers to Rodgers, who is clearly a part of the in-group, reinforcing this celebratory moment related to their team.	EXPLANATION: The comment appears to be expressing excitement and celebration, very likely because of Aaron Rodgers, a player for the in-group team (Packers). Considering Rodgers is an integral part of the Packers, and no other entities are mentioned, the win probability being high suggests that the in-group is performing well. Therefore, 'RODGERS' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1640469454.0	packers	browns	133		5.0	0.708885073661804	0.1425954492865407

[SENT] I see a [OTHER] turn over coming 	['Lions', 'Detroit']	[(7, 12), (64, 71)]	['[OUT]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5]	 The comment "Lions still have fans?" is a disparaging remark about the out-group team, so 'Lions' should be tagged [OUT]. In the next sentence "I see a Detroit turn over coming," 'Detroit' refers to the Lions, reinforcing the out-group team reference. However, the explanation provided in TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS incorrectly tags 'Detroit' as [OTHER], which should be corrected to [OUT]. Therefore, both 'Lions' and 'Detroit' should be tagged [OUT] consistently, as they refer to the out-group in this context. The [SENT] in the middle is tagged [SENT], as it does not refer to any group explicitly.	EXPLANATION: The commenter's team is the Packers and the opponent is the Lions. With a high win probability for the Packers (80.9%), the commenter mocks the opponent team's fanbase by questioning if they still have fans, which implicitly refers to the Lions, thus 'Lions' should be tagged as [OUT]. The sentence "That's ok" serves as a transition and does not need to be tagged. The phrase "Detroit turnover" is referring to an expected mistake by the Lions. 'Detroit' should be tagged as [OUT] because Detroit is home to the Lions, the out-group team.	1641753025.0	packers	lions	134		8.0	0.809273600578308	0.15432212781677132

['We', 'we', '[SENT]']	[(7, 9), (36, 38), (47, 53)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The use of 'we' indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group, which is the 49ers. Fans typically use 'we' to refer to their own team, showing support and camaraderie. Therefore, both instances of 'we' should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence 'LFG' (Let's F---ing Go) is a rallying cry of encouragement and motivation, which fans usually direct towards their own team, implying that '[SENT]' in the second sentence implicitly refers to the in-group. Consequently, '[SENT]' should also be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'We all know 4th qtr is where we shine' uses 'We' and 'we', which are common ways fans refer to their own team, implying the in-group (49ers). The low win probability indicates that the team is currently losing or not doing well, but the comment expresses confidence in their ability to perform well in the fourth quarter, typical of a fan's optimism towards their own team. 'LFG' is an expression of enthusiasm and support, indicating it is about the in-group as well. Therefore, 'We', 'we', and 'LFG' should be tagged [IN]. The [SENT] token in the second sentence is tagged [IN] because it conveys a boost of morale, which is typically an in-group behavior.	1642908783.0	49ers	packers	135	:jerseyaway52: Patrick Willis	8.0	0.128151014447212	0.7952854796638006

The phrase 'Opposing offenses' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team's offenses. The pronouns 'we' (twice) indicate the commenter's perspective as a supporter of the in-group, thus they should be tagged [IN]. 'King' refers to Kevin King, a player on the in-group Packers, and should be tagged [IN] as well.	EXPLANATION: 'Opposing offenses' refers to the out-group team in this context, as they are the ones playing against the in-group (Packers). The win probability being high suggests the in-group is currently doing well, but the comment points out a weakness in their team (reliability on King to give the opponent a first down). 'we' in this context is sarcastic, referring to the in-group team and their action of consistently giving a first down to the opposition. 'King' is a player for the Packers (in-group). Thus, 'we' (twice) and 'King' should be tagged [IN], while 'Opposing offenses' should be tagged [OUT].	1632183567.0	packers	lions	138	:GB:	5.0	0.743323057889938	0.024940504521656356

Since the in-group team is the Cowboys, 'WE' should be tagged with [IN] as it directly refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	The pronoun 'WE' typically signifies affiliation with a group, and in the context of a sports comment, it usually refers to the team the commenter supports. Here, the commenter is asking why their team isn't running the ball, even though it has been effective throughout the game. This concern and use of 'WE' suggest that the commenter is referring to the Cowboys, the in-group team. The high win probability further supports this as the Cowboys have been performing well, making it plausible for a fan to question the team’s strategic choices in a game where they are likely to win. Therefore, 'WE' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Cowboys.	1671394231.0	cowboys	jaguars	139		5.0	0.867470562458038	0.6598230392577957

Since the commenter is supporting the Giants, and this style of encouragement is typically given to an in-group player, 'Flott' should be tagged [IN]. No other player names or teams are mentioned, so only 'Flott' is tagged.	EXPLANATION: The comment is addressing Flott directly, a player for the Giants, which is the in-group team. The commenter is giving encouragement to Flott for his future performance. The phrase 'you'll get it next time' is typically supportive and indicates the commenter is a fan of Flott and therefore of the Giants. Hence, 'Flott' should be tagged with [IN]. There are no other explicit entities mentioned, so no other tags are required.	1671912496.0	giants	vikings	26		2.0	0.49923259019851696	0.6854882705946536

Therefore, 'Malik Davis' should be tagged [IN]. The pronouns 'him' and 'He' both refer back to Malik Davis, so they are also tagged [IN]. The use of 'We' in "We 've been suiting Malik Davis up" is a strong indicator that Malik Davis is part of the in-group, solidifying that all mentions of him should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is discussing the deployment of Malik Davis, a player for the Cowboys, which is the in-group team. The use of 'we' indicates the commenter's affiliation with the in-group, reinforcing that the references to Malik Davis and the pronouns 'him' and 'He' are about an in-group player. The positive language about Malik Davis being 'great in preseason' suggests the commenter is focusing on the in-group's players and their potential contributions. The win probability is relatively high for the Cowboys at this time, suggesting they're doing well, which aligns with the commenter's positive expectations. Therefore, 'Malik Davis', 'him', and 'He' are correctly tagged as [IN] because they refer to an in-group player.   Additionally, since both sentences are essentially about Malik Davis, who is a member of the Cowboys, and the commenter’s pronoun 'we' associates them with the Cowboys, it's appropriate that each sentence is classified under [IN].   Thus, '[SENT]' tokens can be implicitly understood to refer to the in-group without additional explicit entity references.	1666548660.0	cowboys	lions	142	CeeDee Lamb	3.0	0.673307299613953	0.4134808853118712

Since they are discussing an in-group player's performance or situation, 'Robby Anderson' should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: Robby Anderson is a player for the Panthers, the in-group team that the commenter supports. Given the high win probability of 98.4%, it's likely the game is going well for the Panthers, but the commenter is still confused or concerned about something specific regarding Robby Anderson. Since Robby Anderson refers to a player on the in-group team, it should be tagged with [IN].	1632452350.0	panthers	texans	143		3.0	0.9836850166320801	0.9084146459279296

['D', '[SENT]']	[(12, 13), (16, 22)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is encouraging their team to complete a task, which implies support for the in-group. 'D' is a common abbreviation for defense and, without any other context, it is likely referring to the in-group defense (Browns) in this case. The second sentence is an expression of urgency and unity, using the term 'Let’s', which implies the commenter is including themselves with the in-group (Browns). Therefore, both 'D' and '[SENT]' in the second sentence should be tagged as [IN], as they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment demonstrates encouragement towards the in-group team, which in this case is the Browns. 'D' is a shorthand reference for 'defense,' and the context of the comment, which is high in energy and supportive, strongly suggests it is about the in-group's defense. The exclamation 'Let’s finish this !!!' implies that the commenter is cheering for their own team to close out the game successfully (aligning with the high win probability). Thus, 'D' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group's defense and '[SENT]' should also be tagged [IN] in the second sentence since it implicitly refers to the in-group team.	1633291868.0	browns	vikings	144	:browns:	3.0	0.9176649004220963	0.9990297256769869

The tone of the comment suggests that an unexpected or unusual event has occurred involving this player. Since the mention of 'bass' is meant to highlight an uncharacteristic performance from a player of the in-group team, 'bass' should be tagged as [IN]. This reflects the in-group (Bills) perspective of the commenter.	EXPLANATION: The commenter refers to a player with the name 'bass,' which likely refers to Tyler Bass, the placekicker for the Buffalo Bills. Given that the Bills are the in-group team for the commenter, 'bass' refers to an in-group player. The comment indicates that it is unexpected for Bass (Bills' player) to behave in such a way, meaning he is seen as part of the in-group. Therefore, 'bass' is tagged as [IN]. Additionally, the high win probability suggests that the Bills are performing well overall, and the comment on Bass's uncharacteristic action is minor in the context of the game's overall positive outcome for the in-group.	1662685734.0	bills	rams	145	Takeo Spikes Neck 	3.0	0.804897457361221	0.27630781660270654

Since the commenter is referring positively to Butker's skill ('absolutely cannon of a leg'), it makes sense that it is about a player from the in-group team they support. Therefore, 'BUTKER' should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 100% indicates that the game is effectively won by the in-group team, the Chiefs. 'BUTKER' refers to Harrison Butker, who is the kicker for the Chiefs. The phrase 'absolutely cannon of a leg' is praising his kicking ability, which aligns with talking positively about an in-group player, especially when the team is winning decisively. Therefore, 'BUTKER' is tagged as [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	1639339527.0	chiefs	raiders	147	Warpaint	7.0	0.999717175960541	0.6879492205731355

Since there is no explicit word or phrase that refers directly to the in-group or out-group team, the entire sentence is tagged with [IN] to indicate that the commenter is implicitly referring to the performance of the in-group team they support, which in this case are the Ravens.	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing frustration with the performance, which is likely directed towards the in-group team, the Ravens, given their low win probability. Since there is no explicit mention of any entity within the sentence, the entire sentence should be tagged as referring to the in-group. This explains why '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' - the implied context and dissatisfaction with the performance is inherently about the Ravens.	1632686820.0	ravens	lions	149	 :LLAMA:	1.0	0.199927300214767	0.9913035682266451

Since the commenter supports the Giants, Thibodeaux is part of the in-group. The phrase 'getting fucking Bear hugged' suggests that this player is being unfairly treated, likely by an opponent, indicating frustration towards the situation affecting their in-group player. Thus, 'Thibs' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The word 'Thibs' refers to Kayvon Thibodeaux, a player for the Giants, who are the in-group team. The commenter is expressing frustration that a player from the in-group is being 'Bear hugged,' which implies holding or grabbing in a manner often not penalized by officials and is generally seen as unfair. Since the commenter supports the Giants and is talking about an incident involving a Giants player without mentioning any out-group players, 'Thibs' should be tagged as [IN].	1673826879.0	giants	vikings	150	:Giants-Logo-Oldschool:	2.0	0.543348520994186	0.6982726248591814

['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (50, 56)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	The commenter is expressing enthusiasm and support for their team, using phrases like "Let’s get this win" and "let’s goooooo faithful," which are indicative of rallying their fellow supporters. The term "faithful" is a nickname for 49ers fans, further emphasizing the in-group support. Thus, both sentences are clearly aimed at motivating and encouraging the in-group team (49ers), evidenced by the lack of direct references but implicit support language. Therefore, tagging both sentences as [IN] is correct.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is referring to their own team's determination to win despite the odds, rallying support and motivation. The use of "Let’s" and "faithful" strongly indicates support for the in-group team, the 49ers. Although no explicit references to team names or specific players are made, the enthusiasm and motivation clearly signal an in-group context. '52 on a team' is also a rallying cry for their team's efforts. Therefore, both sentences (separated by '[SENT]') should be tagged with [IN] to reflect the implicit support for the 49ers.	1641762758.0	49ers	rams	152	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	6.0	0.595943093299866	0.0

Therefore, 'Daniel Jones' should be tagged as [OUT]. The term 'us' implicitly refers to the in-group team, which is the Packers, indicating that the Giants are performing well against them. Hence, 'us' should be tagged as [IN]. This tagging accurately reflects the relationship between the entities mentioned and the perspective of the commenter.	EXPLANATION: The game is between the Packers and the Giants, with the commenter supporting the Packers. Mention of 'Daniel Jones' refers to a player on the Giants, which is the opponent, making it [OUT]. The pronoun 'us' typically refers to the commenter's own team, which in this case is the Packers, so it should be tagged [IN]. The win probability indicates that the Packers are currently doing well overall, but this comment is focusing on a specific instance where Daniel Jones is performing well against the Packers' defense. Thus, 'Daniel Jones' is correctly tagged as [OUT] and 'us' as [IN].	1665330962.0	packers	giants	153		2.0	0.64368599653244	0.8004289844260002

Pete Carroll is the head coach of the Seahawks, and 'seattle' refers to the city that the Seahawks represent. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Seahawks, both 'Pete Carroll' and 'seattle' should be tagged [IN]. The comment is positively discussing a figure associated with the in-group, making both references to be part of the in-group entities.	Pete Carroll is well-known as the head coach of the Seahawks, which makes him part of the in-group. The term "seattle" refers to the city that the Seahawks represent, thus it is also referring to the in-group. The comment describes Pete Carroll with glasses as a positive change ("the beginning of a new dawn"), which further suggests that the commenter is a fan and supports the in-group team. Given the high win probability, it’s reasonable to assume the commenter is feeling optimistic about their team. Therefore, both "Pete Carroll" and "seattle" should be tagged as [IN] since they are references to the in-group.	1631471250.0	seahawks	colts	26		6.0	0.9255386739969254	0.4572741769064816

Fans typically refer to their own team as 'us' when discussing favorable or unfavorable calls or outcomes. Thus, 'us' is tagged with [IN] to indicate that it refers to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The word 'us' usually implies that the commenter is referring to themselves in relation to their in-group team, which is the Jets in this case. The phrase 'a generous call for us' suggests that the commenter believes the referees made a favorable decision for their team. Consequently, the word 'us' is tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Jets. The relatively low win probability indicates the in-group might not be performing exceptionally well, which could explain why the commenter feels the need to highlight the minor advantage given by the call.	1668969363.0	jets	patriots	156		3.0	0.394605368375778	0.1440820130475303

Since the commenter is criticizing the OC of their own team, 'Canada' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group member, specifically the Steelers' coaching staff.	EXPLANATION: The commenter refers to "Canada," who is Matt Canada, the offensive coordinator (OC) for the Steelers, the in-group team. The context is a critique of the Steelers' offensive coaching, which is why "Canada" should be tagged as [IN], even though the win probability is reasonably high. This suggests that the commenter is more focused on the perceived issues within their team.	1636919616.0	steelers	lions	157	:PIT1::PIT2: Pittsburgh Steelers	4.0	0.572080075740814	0.5105178612407252

In the follow-up comment, 'he' is a continuation of this topic and refers to the same player. Since the original comment is related to the in-group player (Tyler Bass) and the commenter is reinforcing the positive perception of him, 'he' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment refers to Bass, likely Tyler Bass, who is a player for the Bills, the in-group team. Given that "he" is referring back to Bass, it should be tagged [IN]. Additionally, the win probability for the Bills is relatively high, indicating they are doing well, which aligns with the positive comment about Bass still being "quite the catch." Therefore, "he" is tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team player.	1662685811.0	bills	rams	159		1.0	0.7879160493612289	0.2840840234296102

The commenter is expressing that their team (the Raiders) got lucky. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Raiders. Since the entire sentiment is related to the in-group, '[SENT]' is also tagged with '[IN]'.	EXPLANATION: The word 'We' almost always refers to the in-group team supported by the commenter. Given that the in-group team is the Raiders, the commenter is expressing that their own team (the Raiders) got lucky in a particular play or situation. This aligns with the provided win probability, which suggests that the Raiders are slightly favored to win. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged with [IN] since it clearly refers to the in-group team, the Raiders.	1668382835.0	raiders	colts	160	:Logo_95-Present:	7.0	0.595133572816849	0.8551337439102858

Since the Steelers are the out-group team with respect to the commenter, 'the Steelers' should be tagged [OUT]. This clearly indicates that the punter being discussed is a member of the opponent team.	The comment is addressing an issue with the Steelers' punter. Given that the commenter supports the Browns, the Steelers would be the out-group team. 'the Steelers' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team in the context of this game. Furthermore, the comment is implicitly criticizing the punter's performance, which would not align with how a fan of the team would speak about their own team, especially given that the win probability for the in-group (Browns) is relatively high, indicating they are likely doing well overall. Therefore, the reference to 'the Steelers' correctly identifies the out-group.	1635707328.0	browns	steelers	161		2.0	0.686495244503021	0.6991232118135672

Booker and Saquon Glennon are both associated with the Giants, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Booker' and 'Saquon Glennon' should be tagged with [IN] since they are members of the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment mentions Booker and Saquon Glennon, who are players for the Giants, the in-group team that the commenter supports. Despite the low win probability, the commenter is highlighting positive aspects of their team's drive and attributing the success to these in-group players. Therefore, 'Booker' and 'Saquon Glennon' should be tagged with [IN] because they refer to members of the in-group team.	1639938671.0	giants	cowboys	162		5.0	0.133173957467079	0.15655648383581547

['we']	[(27, 29)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 In the given comment, the word 'we' is used without any qualification which typically suggests the commenter is referring to their own team, the in-group, the Browns. The frustration implied by "How many drops have we had today?" is a sentiment more likely associated with criticism of one's own team. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The use of "we" typically signifies that the commenter is referring to their own team, which is the in-group team. The in-group team here is the Browns, and the commenter is expressing frustration over the number of dropped passes. Despite the Browns having a moderate win probability (41.8%), this comment focuses on their perceived shortcomings. Thus, "we" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Browns.	1635709709.0	browns	steelers	163		10.0	0.417969226837158	0.9188740193816336

The follow-up comment builds on this sentiment by indicating that the commenter is looking for ways to ensure this positive outcome, which implies a strong investment in the in-group team's success. Since this entire sentiment is centered around hope and efforts for the Jaguars' performance, the comment should be tagged with [IN] and '[SENT]' is the correct referring expression as there are no explicit words or phrases identifying the in-group.	The win probability indicates that the in-group team (Jaguars) is currently losing, so the commenter is looking for anything that might help to improve the situation, including rituals. This desperation and hopefulness are directed towards the in-group. As there are no explicit references to the team, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' to indicate that the comment is implicitly about supporting the Jaguars.	1636314072.0	jaguars	bills	164	:Anime:	4.0	0.202731981873512	0.5216204315279612

Since the commenter is a supporter of the Vikings, it is reasonable to conclude that this celebration is related to the in-group team achieving something favorable. Therefore, the entire sentence is tagged [IN] despite not explicitly mentioning the team. The lack of explicit references necessitates tagging the sentence-level identifier '[SENT]' with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The phrase "Yoooooo LETS GOOO" is a strong expression of excitement and encouragement. Given that the win probability at the time is relatively high (70.6%), it makes sense that the in-group (Vikings) are doing well, which explains the commenter's enthusiastic response. Even though there isn't a specific reference to the Vikings in the text, the context and tone imply support for the in-group team. Therefore, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] to reflect that the excitement is directed towards the in-group team, the Vikings.	1669348627.0	vikings	patriots	26		1.0	0.705852806568146	0.8558399255467659

test	rue4rq	hqymhmt	t3_rue4rq	[SENT] Nice [IN] ! 	['D']	[(12, 13)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The reference to "Nice D" is likely referring to the defense of the in-group team, which is the Dolphins in this case. Fans typically cheer or praise their own team's defensive plays. Since there is no explicit mention of the opponent or any other team, "D" should be tagged as [IN], indicating it refers to the in-group defense.	EXPLANATION: The comment "Nice D!" is a compliment directed towards the defense of the commenter's supported team. In American football, 'D' usually stands for defense, and since the commenter supports the Dolphins (in-group), the compliment is referring to their team’s defensive play. Despite the win probability being below 50%, it is reasonable to assume that the commenter is finding something positive about their team's defensive performance at that particular moment. Therefore, 'D' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team's defense.	1641147212.0	dolphins	titans	165		3.0	0.443078875541687	0.058714232627276104

['offense']	[(7, 14)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is talking about how the offense is playing conservatively. Since there is no qualification to suggest they are referring to the opponent's offense, it is reasonable to infer they are talking about the in-group offense, as fans usually critique their own team. Thus, 'offense' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group, the Cowboys. The remainder of the sentence doesn't reference any specific entity, but the context is a critique of the in-group's playing strategy.	EXPLANATION: The commenter mentions 'offense' playing conservatively, and no other team or player is specified. Given that the win probability indicates a high chance of winning for the in-group, the Cowboys, it is reasonable to assume that the commenter is referring to the Cowboys' offense. Fans typically use terms like 'offense' without additional qualifiers to refer to their own team. Moreover, the use of 'we' in a parent comment or other similar phrasing is a common way fans talk about their in-group team, providing further context for 'offense' in this comment being tagged as [IN]. Therefore, 'offense' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1639342046.0	cowboys	commanders	166		9.0	0.9940006136894227	0.7931366260423348

"this offense" refers to the Patriots, and thus should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence shifts blame away from Mac (Mac Jones, the Patriots' quarterback) and criticizes Patricia (Matt Patricia, the Patriots' offensive coach), indicating both are members of the in-group. Therefore, "Mac." and "Patricia" should be tagged with [IN]. The third sentence continues the criticism of the in-group without naming any new entities.	EXPLANATION: The win probability is slightly above 50%, suggesting a close game where the in-group might be slightly ahead. The frustration expressed in the comment likely pertains to the in-group, the Patriots, considering the negative emotions directed at the offense without any clear references to the opponent. Specifically:  - In the first sentence, "this offense" is expressing dissatisfaction with the Patriots' performance, thus it is tagged [IN]. - In the second sentence, "It isn't on Mac." refers to Mac Jones, the Patriots' quarterback, thus "Mac." should be tagged [IN]. - "Patricia calls a run up the gut and then a screen and then a wheel route check down." refers to Matt Patricia, who is part of the Patriots' coaching staff, thus "Patricia" should be tagged [IN].  Overall, the comment expresses dissatisfaction with the in-group's strategic decisions rather than their performance against the out-group, which explains why the sentence tags and referring expressions are appropriately marked as [IN].	1669342785.0	patriots	vikings	167		22.0	0.540996193885803	0.3121451838064216

The correct tagging reflects the respective associations of these entities in the context of a Raiders fan commenting on a Raiders-Chargers game situation.	The commenter is discussing their views on quarterback trades and expressing loyalty to their team, the Raiders. 'We' typically refers to the in-group, which in this case is the Raiders. Derek Carr, mentioned multiple times, is the quarterback for the Raiders, which makes 'Carr' an in-group entity. Justin Herbert, mentioned as a comparison, is the quarterback for the Chargers, the out-group in this context, so 'Herbert' is tagged as [OUT].  In the third sentence, the mention of 'Carr' again refers to Derek Carr, reaffirming an in-group reference. 'him' in the fourth sentence and 'the raiders' in the fifth sentence also refer to the in-group, expressing the commenter’s desire for Carr or the Raiders to win a Super Bowl. Finally, 'he' in the last sentence continues to refer to Derek Carr, reaffirming the in-group association.  Therefore, the tags [IN] and [OUT] are appropriately assigned based on the commenter’s context and affiliation with the in-group Raiders and the opponent Chargers.	1662932316.0	raiders	chargers	26		9.0	0.09110374431801505	0.4166907584080177

['this team']	[(22, 31)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is expressing doubt about the team's ability to win, which suggests they are talking about their own team, the Giants, rather than the out-group Bears. This is because fans typically use such self-deprecating language when criticizing their own team's performance. Therefore, 'this team' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing a lack of confidence in the abilities of the in-group team, the Giants, given their very low win probability. The phrase "this team" is a derogatory reference complaining about their team's performance, indicating the commenter feels the Giants are playing poorly. Therefore, "this team" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team (the Giants).	1641151187.0	giants	bears	170		1.0	0.024815497919916996	0.4470028174487516

['Kieft']	[(24, 29)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is expressing enjoyment in seeing a specific player, Kieft, perform a task despite it resulting in a negligible gain. Since the mention of Kieft is positive and specific, it implies familiarity and support from the commenter. As Kieft is a player for the Buccaneers (the in-group), 'Kieft' should be tagged [IN]. The comment does not mention any out-group or other entities explicitly. Therefore, 'Kieft' is correctly tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a Buccaneers fan, and Ko Kieft is a player for the Buccaneers, making him part of the in-group. The comment sarcastically praises Kieft for his blocking efforts despite the run resulting in zero yards. This kind of sarcastic humor is often seen when fans discuss their own team, especially when frustrated about a particular play. As such, 'Kieft' should be tagged [IN] to indicate that he is part of the in-group.	1672602169.0	buccaneers	panthers	172	OldBucsShip	2.0	0.431882381439209	0.503807212785541
test	ruf6qy	hqytt64	t3_ruf6qy	[OUT] That ’s fucking grounding 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment is likely criticizing the opposing team, as grounding is a negative action, usually associated with poor offensive play. Since the in-group is the Titans and grounding is being mentioned in a tone of frustration or accusation, it is reasonable to infer that the comment is directed at the out-group, which is the Dolphins. As there is no explicit word or phrase in the comment referring to the Dolphins, the entire sentence is tagged as [OUT] to indicate that the grounding accusation is directed toward the out-group.	EXPLANATION: In this comment, the commenter is likely reacting to a perceived foul by the out-group team, the Dolphins, given that the current win probability for the in-group, the Titans, is high (82.5%), indicating they are likely doing well. The expression "That’s fucking grounding" is typically directed at an opponent committing an infraction. Since there is no explicit reference to the Dolphins, the entire sentence is implicitly referring to the out-group, thus '[SENT]' should be tagged [OUT] since the comment is implicitly about the opponent committing grounding.	1641149853.0	titans	dolphins	173	:SadPepe:	4.0	0.825187861919403	0.3040691192865106
train	zj75kf	izuaoll	t3_zj75kf	[SENT] [IN] is gonna have to fight for his job looking like 	['Tre']	[(7, 10)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter refers to 'Tre,' who is a player for the in-group team, the 49ers. This indicates concern for his performance and job security, which a fan would typically express about a player on their own team. There are no mentions of the Buccaneers or any other team, so 'Tre' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group. The sentence overall expresses an in-group concern, so "[SENT]" is correctly tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter refers to 'Tre', who is likely Trey Lance, a player on the 49ers, which is the in-group team for the commenter. The comment suggests that Trey Lance may need to fight for his job, which indicates a discussion about a member of the in-group. Given the high win probability, the team is doing well, but the comment seems to focus on an individual's performance within the in-group team rather than the team as a whole. Therefore, 'Tre' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to an in-group player.	1670796801.0	49ers	buccaneers	174	:aiyuk: Brandon Aiyuk	9.0	0.907784797251225	0.2550758045926057

test	rzvzvq	hry46kh	t1_hry4000	[OUT] Yeah , respect for that tbh 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The parent comment expresses admiration for the Ravens' coach, Harbaugh, despite a general dislike for the team ('Hate the ravens but love the pair of danglers harbaugh has between his legs'). The follow-up comment acknowledges this sentiment ('Yeah, respect for that tbh'). Since this respect is directed towards an act performed by a member of the Ravens (Harbaugh), the sentence should be tagged as [OUT], indicating it refers to the out-group team. The tag '[SENT]' is used since the entire sentence implicitly commends the out-group without explicit terms.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment provides context that the original commenter dislikes the Ravens ('Hate the Ravens') but respects the coaching decisions made by Harbaugh, who is the coach of the Ravens. The use of 'respect' here is in reference to the out-group team’s coach. While the comment does not explicitly mention “Ravens” again, it carries over the sentiment from the parent comment. Thus the '[SENT]' token should be tagged with [OUT] since the respect is directed towards an action made by the out-group coach.	1641753857.0	steelers	ravens	176	:sc::c2::c2::sc: Najee Harris	1.0	0.523501574993133	0.1978742108207464

['fumbly Hasty', 'we']	[(27, 39), (51, 53)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter expresses a preference for "fumbly Hasty" over another player, indicating they are talking about someone from their own team, the 49ers. Thus, "fumbly Hasty" is tagged with [IN]. Additionally, "we" suggests ownership and team identity, and since the commenter supports the 49ers, "we" should also be tagged with [IN], as it refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment 'Ok I 'd rather have fumbly Hasty then a guy we signed off the street this week' is complaining about a player that the team's management signed recently, favoring another known player, Hasty. JaMycal Hasty is a player for the 49ers, the team the commenter supports. Since there's frustration about the recent signing and preference for Hasty, both 'fumbly Hasty' and 'we' should be tagged as [IN] because they are references to the in-group team, the 49ers. The high win probability suggests that the team is doing well overall, but the commenter is still critical of in-group decisions.	1632080649.0	49ers	eagles	177	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	3.0	0.9848393201828003	0.8961038961038961

The sense of relief or advantage implied by 'bailed the fuck out' further indicates a scenario where the commenter is expressing satisfaction or surprise benefiting their own team. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the Rams, the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'We' almost always refers to the in-group, which in this case is the Rams. Given that the win probability at the time of the comment is very high (97.9%), the Rams are likely doing well in the game, and the comment indicates relief or satisfaction about a favorable call or an event that helped the Rams maintain or push their lead. Hence, 'We' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1635702883.0	rams	texans	180	Blue Retro Ram	6.0	0.9792784992605448	0.3009783234222137

train	y5lb2l	isl02r1	t3_y5lb2l	[SENT] DAMN , [IN] brought the boom stick 	['JRob']	[(14, 18)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is referring to James Robinson, a player on the Jaguars, which is the in-group team. The phrase "brought the boom stick" is likely a positive remark about a powerful play or action, indicating excitement or pride in the in-group player's performance. Therefore, 'JRob' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is likely referring to James Robinson, a player for the Jaguars, given the nickname 'JRob.' Mentioning a player usually indicates a positive or significant action, especially since 'brought the boom stick' suggests a powerful play. With a low win probability for the Jaguars, any standout play by an in-group player would be noteworthy for commenters, even if the team isn't favored to win. Thus, 'JRob' is tagged as [IN] because it references an in-group player.	1665949326.0	jaguars	colts	182	Logan Cooke :LC9:	2.0	0.25110635161399797	0.8594900341174359

'Defensive line' refers to the in-group's defense and should be tagged [IN], as should 'D line' later in the comment. 'Kelce' is a player for the Chiefs, and since the in-group is the Chiefs, 'Kelce' should be tagged [IN] as well. The overall sentiment of criticism and mentioning specific moments like the Kelce fumble further indicates that these references are about the in-group team.	The comment indicates a critical view of the “Defensive line," “Kelce," and “D line," all likely referring to the in-group team, the Chiefs, especially since Kelce is a well-known Chiefs player. The low win probability at the time of the comment supports this interpretation, as fans often scrutinize their own team’s performance in a challenging game situation.  First sentence: "Defensive line just getting owned." - “Defensive line” is tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group's (Chiefs’) defensive unit struggling.  Second sentence: "That’s the difference in this game." - This sentence connects to the previous statement about the in-group's defensive line but does not explicitly mention an entity that needs to be tagged. Thus, [SENT] is not tagged.  Third sentence: "Obviously the Kelce fumble was bad, but story of this game has to be how poorly D line played.” - “Kelce” refers to Travis Kelce, a well-known player for the Chiefs, making him [IN]. - “D line” in this sentence again refers to the Chiefs’ defensive line, confirming repeated scrutiny on the in-group’s performance, tagged as [IN].

['Raiders']	[(7, 14)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is clearly an enthusiastic supporter urging their team, the Raiders, to get a first down. The only explicit reference to a team is 'Raiders', which should be tagged [IN] since it is the in-group team the commenter supports. There are no other entities referenced in the comment. The rest of the phrases are part of the exhortation to the in-group team to achieve a first down, so they don't need specific tags. Thus, 'Raiders' is correctly tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing frustration and urgency towards the in-group team's performance, specifically asking the Raiders to get a first down. 'Raiders' is an explicit reference to the in-group team, so it should be tagged with [IN]. Each subsequent sentence, while not explicitly referencing the Raiders, is directed towards the Raiders, as indicated by the tone and context set by the first sentence. The low win probability suggests the in-group is struggling, hence the sense of urgency. Therefore, 'Raiders' is tagged [IN], and the rest of the comment implicitly refers to the in-group.	1633398060.0	raiders	chargers	184		6.0	0.25077539682388295	0.28605045180722893

['our defense']	[(14, 25)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses affection for the team's defense, using the possessive word "our," which indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group team they support. In this case, "our defense" is referring to the Bengals' defense. Therefore, "our defense" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the Bengals, the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'our defense' is a clear reference to the in-group team supported by the commenter, which in this case is the Bengals. The use of the possessive pronoun 'our' typically indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team. Despite the relatively low win probability, the commenter expresses positive sentiment about the defense of their own team. Therefore, 'our defense' should be tagged as [IN].	1662922161.0	bengals	steelers	185		2.0	0.355254650115967	0.47673022068758447

['KC']	[(7, 9)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is referring to 'KC', which stands for Kansas City, the location name often used to refer to the Kansas City Chiefs. Since the in-group team that the commenter supports is the Chiefs, 'KC' should be tagged with [IN] because it is a reference to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter supports the Chiefs and refers to "KC," which is commonly known shorthand for Kansas City, the home of the Chiefs. With a high win probability (90.9%), it is clear that the commenter believes the Chiefs (KC) have frequently encountered the same officiating crew. Therefore, "KC" is tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, the Kansas City Chiefs. There are no other explicit referring expressions in the comment.	1637536189.0	chiefs	cowboys	186		1.0	0.908533811569214	0.5788206979542719

"MIAMI" refers to the geographical location associated with the Dolphins, and "THE DOLPHINS" explicitly names the team. Therefore, both "MIAMI" and "THE DOLPHINS" should be tagged as [IN] since they are direct references to the in-group. The overall tone of the comment indicates support and pride, which aligns with referring to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be emphasizing the in-group team by stating "MIAMI HAS THE DOLPHINS," with Miami being a metonym for the Dolphins team. 'MIAMI' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the city of the in-group team, and 'THE DOLPHINS' should be tagged [IN] as it directly refers to the in-group team. The high win probability suggests that the commenter is making a positive statement about the in-group. Since there's no indication of the out-group or any other team, both references should be tagged with [IN].	1636689651.0	dolphins	ravens	187	17	3.0	0.679304778575897	0.7744422572178478
train	pvwmu9	hed95fd	t3_pvwmu9	[IN] What a play ! 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment 'What a play!' is expressing excitement or admiration, which is generally directed towards a positive outcome for the in-group team. Since the comment does not contain any explicit referring expressions, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN], indicating that this praise is for a play made by the in-group team, the Chargers.	EXPLANATION: The comment "What a play!" is a short, positive exclamation without any explicit references to players or teams. Given that the win probability is quite low for the in-group team, the Chargers, it is more likely that any celebratory or positive comment would be directed at the in-group, possibly in reaction to a rare good play or a moment of optimism. Since there is no direct reference to the in-group or out-group, the entire sentence should be tagged [IN] to reflect the assumption that the commenter is praising their own team's play. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN].	1632676452.0	chargers	chiefs	188	bolt	6.0	0.18233019113540605	0.061649964209019324

DJ and Cam are both players for the in-group team, the Panthers. Therefore, 'DJ' and 'cam' in both sentences should be tagged [IN]. The comment describes Xavien Howard, an out-group player, successfully defending against DJ, an in-group player, indicating his performance against the in-group. Similarly in the second sentence, the commenter discusses a play involving two in-group players, DJ and Cam, criticizing their coordination. Hence, 'DJ' and 'cam' should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a supporter of the Panthers, and the game is against the Dolphins. Xavien Howard is a well-known player for the out-group Dolphins, so 'Xavien Howard' should be tagged as [OUT]. 'DJ' refers to DJ Moore, a player for the in-group Panthers, so it should be tagged as [IN]. Similarly, 'cam' refers to Cam Newton, another player for the Panthers, thus it should also be tagged as [IN]. The win probability is fairly low for the in-group, indicating that they are behind, which aligns with the criticism in the second sentence where Panthers players are being discussed. Therefore, 'Xavien Howard' is tagged [OUT], and 'DJ' and 'cam' are tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, all instances of 'cam' and 'DJ' are tagged as [IN] to reflect their association with the in-group.	1638125715.0	panthers	dolphins	189		7.0	0.37223290143658905	0.30049261083743845

Since the Chiefs are the in-group team the commenter supports, the name 'Fortson' should be tagged as [IN]. The comment lauds Fortson, indicating approval, which aligns with the positive support typically shown towards in-group players. Thus, 'Fortson' is correctly tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is praising Fortson, a player. Given that the in-group team is the Chiefs, and usually commenters will praise their own team's players, it's reasonable to deduce that Fortson is a player for the Chiefs. The win probability is fairly balanced, which doesn't provide strong clues for identifying the in-group or out-group, but the context of earning a roster spot leans toward supporting their own team. Therefore, 'Fortson' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Chiefs).	1632682313.0	chiefs	chargers	190	Patrick Mahomes #3	10.0	0.458875704867822	0.5860773085182533

Here, "the Saints" explicitly refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports, indicating their preference and disappointment with the real-world performance of the team. Therefore, "the Saints" is correctly tagged as [IN].	The in-group team is the Saints, which the commenter supports. This comment reflects a sense of frustration at the real-life performance of the Saints, indicated by the very low win probability of 7.3%. The commenter suggests that they can only make the Saints win in Madden (a popular football video game), implying the actual team is struggling. 'the Saints' should be tagged with [IN] since it directly refers to the in-group team the commenter supports (the Saints).	1668371737.0	saints	steelers	191		2.0	0.07346762716770205	0.8998629600626469

The question suggests he had a mental breakdown, indicating a focus on him specifically, which is relevant to the in-group team the commenter supports. Hence, 'AB' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The comment refers to "AB," which is commonly known to represent Antonio Brown, a well-known player for the Buccaneers, the in-group team. The Buccaneers have a relatively low win probability, which could contribute to the commenter's concern about a player's mental state, potentially affecting team performance. Since "AB" refers to a player on the in-group team, the tag [IN] is appropriate.	1641154513.0	buccaneers	jets	192		6.0	0.356110215187073	0.7430011198208286
train	10dd66y	j4o4tif	t1_j4o4kjb	[IN] Peyton stood up for that one on Manningcast lol 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 Peyton Manning is a retired NFL quarterback who is now a broadcaster; he is neither a Cowboys player nor a Buccaneers player. His mention here could be a humorous reference relevant to football fans in general, but it isn't aligning with the in-group or out-group directly. However, "Peyton stood up for that one on Manningcast lol" implicitly suggests something praiseworthy or notable in relation to the in-group’s performance since Manningcast is a popular broadcast among fans, and "stood up" could imply acknowledgment of a good play. Therefore, the entire sentence is indirectly referring to the in-group Cowboys' performance, and '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' for lacking an explicit reference but insinuating positive mention towards the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment references Peyton Manning, who is a retired player and thus doesn't belong to either the in-group (Cowboys) or the out-group (Buccaneers). However, there's no explicit mention of in-group or out-group entities in the comment, so '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] by default. This is because, unless there's a clear indication otherwise, commenters often refer to their own team (in-group) in a positive or neutral context, and with the very high win probability, it implies the commenter is in a good mood, likely talking about their team indirectly while mentioning something entertaining they just saw.	1673921333.0	cowboys	buccaneers	193	Tony Romo	1.0	0.890017164540277	0.2800527240773287

[SENT] Kind of getting sick of all these calls [OUT] Dallas way . 	['going']	[(153, 158)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter expresses frustration about calls going in favor of Dallas, indicating a bias against the opponent, which in this case are the Cowboys. The phrase "going Dallas way" shows that these perceived favorable calls are benefiting Dallas, the out-group team here. The term "going" in the context of the second sentence implies benefit or favoritism towards Dallas, so it should be tagged [OUT] since it pertains to the out-group team, Dallas Cowboys. There is no direct reference to the in-group team (Chiefs) in the comment.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing frustration about officiating favoring the opponent team. The phrase "hands to the face that wasn't called on that 2nd down run" indicates a missed penalty, and "getting sick of all these calls going Dallas way" suggests that calls are unfairly benefiting Dallas, the out-group team. While ‘Dallas’ explicitly refers to the out-group team, the word ‘going’ in this context refers to the direction of the favorable calls and thus is tagged with [OUT] indicating that these calls are benefiting the out-group Cowboys. The win probability is high, suggesting the in-group Chiefs are likely winning, but the commentator is still unhappy with biased officiating. Therefore, the tag for 'going' should be [OUT] since it qualifies the phrase 'Dallas way' implying the out-group team.	1637533871.0	chiefs	cowboys	194		2.0	0.910130582749844	0.3642506711098769

'That guy' likely refers to a player from the opposing team (49ers) who presumably caused Pacheco to land awkwardly, warranting the suggestion of ejection, which indicates it should be tagged [OUT].	Pacheco is a player on the Chiefs, the in-group team the commenter supports, hence he should be tagged with [IN]. The phrase 'that guy should be ejected' implies that the commenter believes an out-group player (from the 49ers) committed a problematic action against Pacheco, hence 'that guy' should be tagged with [OUT]. The high win probability suggests that the Chiefs (in-group) are likely performing well overall, but this specific comment focuses on an incident involving Pacheco, leading to the specific tagging.	1666563049.0	chiefs	49ers	196	Chiefs	6.0	0.759498238563538	0.564484126984127

Therefore, "Bolt up" indicates that the comment is referring to the in-group team (Chargers), and it should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment "Bolt up" is a rallying cry for the Chargers, which is the in-group team. This type of comment is usually made by fans to show support and encouragement for their team, especially during tough times, as indicated by the low win probability of 10.1%. There are no other explicit entities mentioned, and the entire comment is an implicit reference to supporting the in-group team, so the sentence as a whole should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, "Bolt up" is tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group, Chargers.	1670196747.0	chargers	raiders	197		-1.0	0.10084925591945604	0.6799429742493095

Since the in-group team is the Bengals and the out-group team is the Steelers, it is reasonable to conclude that 'them' refers to the Steelers. Fans typically express hatred towards their rivals (out-group), especially after an incident perceived as a 'dirty hit.' Therefore, 'them' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the out-group Steelers.	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing strong negative emotion towards an unspecified group referred to as "them". Given that "dirty fking hit" is a disparaging term, it is likely aimed at the opponent, since fans typically express such disdain towards the other team for perceived unsportsmanlike behavior. The win probability of 39.2% suggests that the Bengals (in-group) are not doing well, which could exacerbate the commenter's frustration towards the Steelers (out-group). Hence, "them" refers to the out-group, and should be tagged [OUT].	1662919344.0	bengals	steelers	199		12.0	0.391787320375443	0.2652754841615373

The comment is sarcastically suggesting extending his contract, a criticism likely to come from a fan of the in-group team when the team is underperforming. Therefore, 'Canada' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a member of the Steelers' coaching staff.	EXPLANATION: In this comment, 'Canada' refers to Matt Canada, who is the offensive coordinator for the Steelers, the in-group team. The high win probability suggests that the team is performing well, which is reflective in the sarcastic suggestion to extend Matt Canada’s contract. Therefore, the name 'Canada' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team, the Steelers. The rest of the sentence does not contain explicit references to entities and thus has no additional tags.	1671393103.0	steelers	panthers	200		2.0	0.898436400758811	0.6347531461761858

The critique is about the overall quality of the league's officiating and its effect on the enjoyment of the game, a sentiment not exclusive to the game between the Commanders and the Giants. Therefore, both sentences should be tagged as [OTHER], reflecting that the gripe is against a broader issue affecting the entire NFL, not just the specific teams playing.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment is discussing NFL referees negatively impacting the game. The phrase "Too true" and the subsequent sentence "Makes me really pissed" are both agreeing with the sentiment towards the NFL referees and not talking specifically about the in-group or out-group teams. Because NFL refereeing is a general issue affecting all teams, the sentiment doesn't specifically pertain to either the Commanders or the Giants. Hence, each '[SENT]' in the comment is correctly tagged as [OTHER].	1631841805.0	commanders	giants	201		3.0	0.494379460811615	0.307259756609316

In the reply, the commenter refutes this by saying they did not see such behavior and clarifies what they observed instead. 'They' in the second sentence refers to the Bills fans (out-group) who are actually expressing concern, contrary to the parent comment. Thus, 'They' should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team the commenter is discussing.	The parent comment accuses Bills fans of celebrating an injury to Justice Hill, who is presumably a player on the in-group Ravens team. The commenter then indicates that they checked and did not see any such behavior, and references people (implicitly Bills fans, given the context of the parent comment) who are saying positive things like "hope he’s ok." Since 'They' in the second sentence refers to the Bills fans who are saying supportive things, it should be tagged with [OUT], as it refers to the out-group. The first sentence does not explicitly reference any group, so no specific entity needs to be tagged there. Therefore, 'They' is correctly tagged as [OUT] with respect to the context and the team affiliations.	1664739882.0	ravens	bills	202	 :MD:	2.0	0.593248069286346	0.8922808947561423
train	s5prqn	hszfkme	t3_s5prqn	[IN] HERE WE GO 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The phrase "HERE WE GO" is a cheer commonly associated with fans supporting their team, indicating excitement or encouragement. Given that the commenter is a Steelers fan, it is reasonable to interpret this cheer as support for the in-group team, the Steelers. There is no explicit mention of a team in the comment, so the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' to reflect the in-group reference.	EXPLANATION: The comment "HERE WE GO" is a cheering phrase that fans typically use to rally and support their team. With no explicit mention of a team and considering the context of a low win probability, it implies that the commenter is trying to encourage their team, the in-group (Steelers), to make a comeback or put up a good performance. Since this is an implicitly in-group supportive comment, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is marked as [IN].	1642385108.0	steelers	chiefs	203	:sh:9:sh: Boswell	2.0	0.13813775777816795	0.27460611677479146

['Zac']	[(41, 44)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is humorously suggesting that they could apply for the job of Zac Taylor, who is the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals. Since Zac is associated with the Bengals (the in-group team), the reference to 'Zac' is tagged with [IN]. The second sentence doesn't reference any specific entity, but it follows from the first in expressing frustration about the in-group team's performance, so the tag remains [IN] implicitly. Thus, 'Zac' is tagged correctly, and the sentences are tagged as [IN] overall due to the context.	The commenter talks about Zac, who is likely referencing Zac Taylor, the head coach of the Bengals, the in-group team. The context includes the commenter joking about applying for Zac's job, pointing towards a dissatisfaction with the in-group's current performance, which aligns with the win probability indicating they are likely losing. Additionally, the commenter mentions they can't be any worse, which implies a critical view of the Bengals' current performance. Thus, 'Zac' in the comment points to a member of the in-group and should be tagged with [IN].	1663536484.0	bengals	cowboys	204		1.0	0.43229913711547796	0.3468138391614878

Given that the Bengals are the in-group team for the commenter, 'burrow' should be tagged with [IN]. The commenter is likely expressing admiration or amazement at Burrow's ability to evade tackles, indicating a positive sentiment towards the in-group player. Therefore, the tagged output and the referring expression are correctly identified.	EXPLANATION: The comment is praising Joe Burrow, a quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals, who is the in-group team the commenter supports. This is indicated by the use of 'Jesus' as a form of admiration or exclamation for Burrow's skill in being 'slippery' or difficult to tackle. Given that the win probability is quite low for the in-group at the time of the comment, it still shows the commenter is focusing on a positive aspect of their team's performance. Therefore, 'burrow' should be tagged [IN] because he is a player for the in-group team.	1641149999.0	bengals	chiefs	206		2.0	0.101078011095524	0.30581312410841655

The pronoun 'He' in the commenter’s reply most likely refers to Kinlaw. Hence, 'He' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player who attempted a play ('dove') and missed ('whiffed').	EXPLANATION: The parent comment states that Kinlaw, a player for the 49ers (the in-group), just went down. The reply follows up on this situation, describing the actions of 'He,' which logically refers back to the same player mentioned in the parent comment. Given the extremely high win probability for the in-group, it's likely the commenter is lenient about the player's mistake, but still discussing an in-group player. Therefore, 'He' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a 49ers player.	1673221611.0	49ers	cardinals	207	:jerseyaway52: Patrick Willis	1.0	0.999139934428968	0.8235807860262009

In the context of the comment, "he" and "kelce" refer to players on the in-group team, the Chiefs. "he" most likely refers to a Chiefs player who was trying to lateral the ball, and "kelce" refers to Travis Kelce, a well-known Chiefs player. Therefore, "he" and "kelce" should both be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The last sentence contains the phrase "Did he try to lateral it to kelce," which is referencing players on the Chiefs team, the in-group team (since the commenter supports the Chiefs). "he" and "kelce" are both referring to in-group players - presumably the quarterback and star tight end of the Chiefs, respectively. Even though the overall comment does not explicitly mention anyone by their specific names, it implies that the involved players are on the Chiefs, based on the context provided by the parent comment. Thus, "he" and "kelce" should be tagged with [IN] because they refer to players belonging to the in-group team.	1636946801.0	chiefs	raiders	208		1.0	0.831440433859825	0.6929163176021595

Hence, this comment is about the in-group, Seahawks, as there is no indication that the comment pertains to the Falcons (out-group). 'Defense' is tagged with [IN] since it refers to the defense of the team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment is a critique of the in-group team's defense, which is usually unspecified and assumed to be the in-group if stated without qualification. The phrase 'Defense is terrible' indicates the in-group (Seahawks) since fans typically critique their own team, especially when the win probability is low, as it is here (21.6%). Therefore, 'Defense' is tagged as [IN] because it references the in-group.	1664146490.0	seahawks	falcons	209	​	5.0	0.216368734836578	0.8635180722891567

The use of "his" further references Feliciano, making it implicit that the commenter is critiquing a player from the in-group (Giants). Thus, 'feliciano' and 'his' are tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: Feliciano is a player for the Giants, the in-group team. The comment expresses frustration with Feliciano, calling him names and mocking his actions, which indicates that the commenter is talking about a player from their own team. The use of 'his' further refers to Feliciano, maintaining the in-group context. Even though the win probability for the Giants is relatively high, fans can still be critical of their own team’s players. Therefore, 'feliciano' and 'his' are correctly tagged as [IN].	1670186654.0	giants	commanders	210		5.0	0.609285751341618	0.7999174917491749

'The Eagles' and 'Hurts' refer to the out-group team and its quarterback, respectively. Therefore, 'The Eagles' and the two instances of 'Hurts' should be tagged with [OUT]. The use of 'We' and 'we' refers to the in-group team (Falcons), indicating the commenter's affiliation and the team's situation, so 'We', 'We', and 'we' should be tagged with [IN]. Additionally, the sentences discussing the in-group without explicitly mentioning the team are tagged with [IN] because they are implicitly referring to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment is breaking down various statistics and situations involving both the in-group (Falcons) and the out-group (Eagles). 'The Eagles' is the opponent team and should be tagged [OUT]. 'Hurts' is a player for the Eagles, and so both instances of 'Hurts' in the comment should also be tagged [OUT]. 'We' in this context refers to the in-group team, the Falcons, and since 'We' is used without qualification, it can be inferred that it refers to the team the commenter supports. Therefore, the occurrences of 'We' and 'we' should be tagged with [IN].	1631475744.0	falcons	eagles	211		1.0	0.032678846269846	0.8364203027604631

"Pats" is a colloquial name for the Patriots, which is the team that the commenter supports. Therefore, "the Pats D" refers to the in-group's defense and should be tagged as [IN]. The rest of the sentence does not explicitly reference any other entities, and thus only "the Pats D" is tagged in this context.	EXPLANATION: The phrase "the Pats D" refers to the Patriots' defense. Since the in-group team for the commenter is the Patriots, "the Pats D" should be tagged [IN]. There are no other explicit entities mentioned in the comment that refer to either the out-group or any other team.

Since there are no explicit referring expressions here, the [SENT] tokens are not tagged. 4. **Fifth Sentence**: The phrase "The offense needs to close out drives better" explicitly mentions "The offense," which refers to the 49ers' offense.

The commenter is replying to this in a way that critiques their team's perceived shortcomings. 'They' in the first and second sentences is an unspecified but obvious reference to the in-group team, the 49ers, as the commenter argues against the initial positive statement about the defense. In the fifth sentence, 'the offense' explicitly calls out an aspect of the in-group team needing to improve, and 'they' in the same sentence continues this critique of the offense. Since the 49ers are winning with a probability of 74.5%, the commenter’s frustration is likely about specific flaws they perceive in their team's performance despite their overall favorable position. Therefore, all instances of 'They', 'The offense', and 'they' should be tagged as [IN].	1673735892.0	49ers	seahawks	216		1.0	0.744921445846558	0.3604533308762554

Fans typically use "we" to describe their own team's performance. The commenter is critiquing a play related to their team, clearly showing their dissatisfaction with their team's execution, specifically mentioning a missed catch resulting from a horrendous throw. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: 'We' here refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. Given that the in-group in this context is the Jets, the commenter is expressing frustration about a play involving their team missing a catch. This interpretation is supported by the low win probability (16.9%), suggesting that the team is not doing well, which often leads fans to vent about poor performance.

The commenter appears to continue criticizing someone from the in-group (Ravens), specifically Greg Roman, implying he can see the open field but chooses to ignore it. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a member of the in-group team (Ravens).	EXPLANATION: With a low win probability for the Ravens, the commenter is complaining about a tactical issue, likely criticizing someone on the in-group (Ravens) team. Given that the parent comment references Greg Roman, the offensive coordinator for the Ravens, it is reasonable to assume that "he" refers to Greg Roman, who is part of the in-group.

In this context, 'These refs' refers to the referees, who are not part of either the in-group (Giants) or out-group (Lions), but are instead independent officials. Therefore, 'These refs' and 'you' should both be tagged as [OTHER], indicating that they are not associated with either of the teams playing in the game.	EXPLANATION: The term "these refs" and "you" are referring to the officials or referees of the game, who are neither part of the in-group (Giants) nor the out-group (Lions). Referees are considered neutral parties officiating the game, therefore not belonging to either team. The comment expresses frustration at the referees, making it clear that these entities should be tagged as [OTHER].	1668971057.0	giants	lions	220		6.0	0.409891486167908	0.33201474422368066

The comment is criticizing a decision made by Dorsey, indicating that the commenter is focused on the in-group team’s performance. Therefore, 'Dorsey' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a member of the in-group team.	The in-group team is the Bills, and 'Dorsey' refers to Ken Dorsey, who is the offensive coordinator for the Bills. Even though the win probability is relatively high, the commenter appears to be frustrated with a decision made by someone from their own team. This type of criticism without more context usually comes from a fan discussing their own team, hence why 'Dorsey' is tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group.	1664127206.0	bills	dolphins	221	:block-B::block-I::block-L::block-L::block-S:	5.0	0.727021545171738	0.1618705035971223

'the team' in the first sentence is also referring to the Rams, and thus tagged [IN]. On the other hand, the Cowboys and 49ers are mentioned as other teams whose fans are present in LA, but they are not the in-group or the out-group opponent (Cardinals) in this context. Thus, 'the Cowboys' and '49ers' should be tagged [OTHER] as they are other NFL teams that are being mentioned but are different from the in-group and out-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment discusses the presence of Rams fans and contrasts this with the fans of other teams (Cowboys and 49ers) in LA. The first sentence mentions "Rams fans" and "the team" both referring to the in-group Rams and should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence mentions the "Rams" and notes the perception that they have no fans, hence it should be tagged [IN]. It also references "Cowboys" and "49ers", which are other teams, thus tagged [OTHER]. The third sentence states "The Rams have fans," clearly referring to the in-group Rams, and should similarly be tagged [IN]. The fourth sentence mentions the presence of fans from both "49ers" and "Cowboys" as well as "Rams fans living in LA," where "49ers" and "Cowboys" should be tagged [OTHER] and "Rams fans" [IN]. The last sentence explains the large fanbases of "Cowboys" and "49ers" due to the Rams going 21 years without a team, thus both mentions of "Cowboys" and "49ers" should be tagged [OTHER]. This consistent identification of team references explains why specific words and phrases denoting entities are tagged	1668378727.0	rams	cardinals	14	LA Rams	14.0	0.373895049095154	0.36446426911997026

Since no qualifications or distinctions are made, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is referring to their own team's defense—the in-group. The critical tone is consistent with how fans typically complain about their own team when they are dissatisfied with performance. Therefore, "this shitty defense" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the Eagles, the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely referring to the in-group team, the Eagles, given the mention of "this shitty defense" and the low win probability of 22%, indicating that the in-group team is struggling in the game. Fans typically express frustration about their own team's poor performance in such terms. Therefore, "this shitty defense" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group's defense. The sentence as a whole is about the in-group, so it doesn't need an explicit mention to be relevant to the Eagles. This validates the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS.	1676256012.0	eagles	chiefs	222		2.0	0.220422208309174	0.8385053831538949

In the first sentence, 'Purdy' and 'he' both refer to this in-group player and thus should be tagged [IN]. 'The D.' refers to the 49ers' defense, which is part of the in-group, so it should also be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, 'My man BCB' is a nickname for Purdy, who is an in-group player, so it should be tagged [IN]. Finally, in the third sentence, 'He' again refers to Purdy, the in-group player, and should be tagged [IN] as well. Therefore, all these referring expressions are tagged correctly as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing specific players and their performance, all of whom are associated with the in-group team, the 49ers. 'Purdy' refers to Brock Purdy, a player on the 49ers, thus it should be tagged [IN]. The third-person pronouns 'he' and 'He' in the first and third sentences refer to Purdy, so they should also be tagged [IN]. 'the D.' refers to the defense of the 49ers, thus it should be tagged [IN]. 'My man BCB' is an affectionate reference to Brock Purdy again, so it should be tagged [IN]. The overall commentary reflects a fan’s perspective, as they provide advice and express faith in the player's ability to recover, which aligns with how supporters talk about their team. Hence, all the entity references are correctly tagged as [IN].	1672616898.0	49ers	raiders	223	:jerseyaway16: Joe Montana	5.0	0.768608272075653	0.8001801654246171

Fans typically discuss their own team's performance in this manner. Hence, 'This line' is tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment "This line is putrid tho" is likely referring to the offensive or defensive line of the in-group team, the Titans. Given the extremely low win probability (1.3%), it's reasonable to assume that the commenter is frustrated with the performance of their team. The phrase "This line" should therefore be tagged as [IN], as the commenter is criticizing their own team's line.	1663637072.0	titans	bills	224		1.0	0.013100326061249001	0.6642617881989178

['Players']	[(7, 14)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter states that the "Players are playing well; turnovers have covered up the issues today." This is a positive comment about how well the players are performing, suggesting that the commenter is supportive of the team. Since the comment does not specify which team's players are being referred to, it is likely that the commenter is referring to the in-group team (the Browns), as fans usually comment positively about their own team rather than the opposition. Therefore, "Players" should be tagged [IN], as it refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is focused on the performance of 'Players' and the fact that 'turnovers have covered up the issues today'. Given the high win probability for the in-group, it is reasonable to assume that the commenter is referring to their own team's players who are playing well, even if there are some underlying issues masked by turnovers. In American football, fans generally refer to their own team's players without specifying the team. Therefore, 'Players' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Browns.	1639341658.0	browns	ravens	226	:bills:	1.0	0.900150961488485	0.8426986240568132
test	zj8gpk	izupnvb	t1_izuplbw	[SENT] They will beat [IN] 	['ua']	[(22, 24)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The parent comment implies that the in-group team (Seahawks) is at a disadvantage, setting up the context that the out-group or another team will outperform them. The phrase "They will beat ua" confirms this context as it talks about the in-group team possibly losing. The expression "ua" is a typographical error likely intended to be "us", which refers to the in-group (Seahawks). Thus, "ua" should be tagged as [IN], denoting the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment mentions the '49’ers' running over 'us' on Thursday, referring to a future game against another team (49ers) rather than the current game. Since the commenter's in-group team (Seahawks) plays against the Panthers now, and 49ers are the focus here, 'They' refers to the other NFL team (49ers), but 'ua' or 'us' refers to the commenter's in-group team, Seahawks. The win probability is very low, highlighting the commenter's pessimism about the Seahawks' performance in the current game. Thus 'ua' should be tagged [IN] indicating the in-group team.	1670803225.0	seahawks	panthers	227		1.0	0.0982122136583636	0.8533920866611585

['the WR group']	[(56, 68)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter expresses disbelief about initially thinking that their team's wide receiver (WR) group would be a strength. The mention of "the WR group" is a reflection on their own team's performance, which is something fans typically do when evaluating their in-group team. Thus, "the WR group" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports (the Jaguars).	The comment expresses disappointment regarding the WR (wide receiver) group, which would typically be about the in-group team the commenter supports. Since there is no mention of the out-group team (Titans) and it is common for fans to critique their own team's perceived shortcomings, 'the WR group' is naturally referring to the Jaguars' WRs. The win probability is relatively low, indicating the team might not be performing well currently, which aligns with the frustration expressed by the commenter. Hence, 'the WR group' should be tagged with [IN].	1633887181.0	jaguars	titans	228	King Dedede :KingDedede:	6.0	0.297409355640411	0.1647427293064877

train	ynvs2p	ivbx7h2	t3_ynvs2p	[IN] Actual trash smh 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment 'Actual trash smh' is a critical statement that is likely directed at the in-group team, the Dolphins. Fans typically express frustration and disappointment in their own team's poor performance rather than the opponent's. Since there is no explicit mention of any team or player, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to indicate that the criticism is towards the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment "Actual trash smh" is a negative statement reflecting disappointment or frustration. Given that the win probability for the Dolphins (the in-group) is relatively high, it's still plausible that a fan is criticizing a specific aspect of their team’s performance, since fans can express dissatisfaction even when their team is leading. Since there is no explicit mention of an entity in the comment, the entire sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' because the comment is implicitly criticizing the in-group despite their favorable win probability.	1667768081.0	dolphins	bears	230		2.0	0.74150687456131	0.9581664026833131

'CHI' (Chicago Bears) is the abbreviation for Chicago, which is the opponent team (out-group), so it should be tagged [OUT]. 2. 'Vikings' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, so it should be tagged [IN]. 3. The second sentence expresses affection for a specific in-group player, Boyd. 'Boyd' is likely a player on the in-group team (Vikings), so it should be tagged [IN].  Hence, the sentences are tagged with the respective referring expressions '[CHI]' as [OUT], '[Vikings]' as [IN], and '[Boyd]' as [IN] correctly.	EXPLANATION: With a high win probability for the Vikings (98.5%), the in-group team is doing very well in the match. The commenter mentions "CHI," which is referring to the Chicago Bears, the out-group team, so it is tagged [OUT]. The mention of "Vikings" refers to the in-group team, so it is tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "Boyd" is a player for the Vikings, and the expression of love clearly indicates a positive sentiment toward a member of the in-group. Thus, "Boyd" is also tagged [IN]. Therefore, the correct tagged output and referring expressions are as provided, with "CHI" tagged [OUT], "Vikings" tagged [IN], and "Boyd" tagged [IN].	1640057635.0	vikings	bears	231	vikings	3.0	0.9851471781730652	0.7497291440953413

Since the commenter is talking about feeling the same emotions as Vrabel, it implies alignment with the in-group's perspective. Therefore, 'Vrabel' refers to the in-group and should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: Mike Vrabel is the head coach of the Tennessee Titans, the in-group team that the commenter supports. Given the low win probability of the Titans, the commenter's frustration is very likely directed towards their own team's situation. With no other entities mentioned, "Vrabel" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group coach. The comment implicitly expresses empathy with Vrabel, reinforcing that it pertains to the in-group situation.	1638124663.0	titans	patriots	232	:Neely:	3.0	0.19047990441322304	0.19883151149641914

Since Fields is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports, 'FIELDS' should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: While the win probability is relatively balanced, the commenter likely supports the Bears due to Fields being referred to as "the GOAT" (Greatest of All Time), which is a highly positive and supportive term. Fields is a quarterback for the Bears, so the word 'FIELDS' in this context refers to an in-group player. Therefore, 'FIELDS' should be tagged as [IN].	1668367638.0	bears	lions	233		2.0	0.548682391643524	0.4796563768526385

Therefore, 'the Bears' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team. In the latter part of the sentence where they mention 'a 24-0 victory for the Steelers,' it refers to the opponent team, and thus 'the Steelers' should be tagged as [OUT]. The comment expresses a clear comparison between the in-group's potential victory and the out-group's past victory.	The commenter is a supporter of the Bears (in-group) and the low win probability suggests they are not doing well, making it sound aspirational for the Bears to win. The phrase "the Bears" refers to the in-group team, while "the Steelers" refers to the opponent team, the out-group. The commenter hopes for a win for the Bears if they can get a stop, and contrasts this with larger victories for the Steelers. This framing clearly identifies the Bears as the in-group ([IN]) and the Steelers as the out-group ([OUT]). Thus, "the Bears" should be tagged [IN] and "the Steelers" should be tagged [OUT].	1636423284.0	bears	steelers	26		8.0	0.074670970439911	0.22812447716245607

The reply defends Waller by mentioning his injury, which suggests the commenter is supportive of him. Thus, 'He' refers to Waller, who is part of the in-group, making it suitable to tag 'He' with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The parent comment is discussing Waller, a player for the Raiders, and the sentiment is defensive of him, indicating the commenter is a fan of the Raiders (in-group). Given the win probability is relatively low for the in-group, it is plausible that the commenter is more focused on defending their player rather than the overall game status. 'He' referring to Waller should be tagged [IN] since it is referring to an in-group player, supporting the overall defensive tone the commenter takes towards him in the context of the game.	1670190990.0	raiders	chargers	235		2.0	0.329620063304901	0.1669785262407556

The question directed at Stokes suggests disappointment or confusion regarding his action, which a fan would most likely express toward a player on their own team. Since 'Stokes' is a member of the in-group, it should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is addressed to 'Stokes,' who is a player for the Packers. Given that the commenter supports the Packers, and the high win probability suggests that the in-group team is doing well, it is reasonable to tag 'STOKES' as [IN]. The commenter expresses frustration or confusion towards a specific action taken by Stokes, indicative of the familiar and critical tone fans often adopt towards their own team's players. Therefore, 'STOKES' is correctly tagged as [IN].	1640476017.0	packers	browns	236	:87:	5.0	0.912396319210529	0.7753567296567683

Since the commenter is a Cowboys fan and the parent comment talks about issues with the pass rush in a critical way, it’s reasonable to infer that "the QB" refers to the Cowboys' QB here. The commenter is trying to explain why the Cowboys' defense is struggling, thereby linking the QB to the in-group team. Thus, "the QB" should be tagged [IN] as it is implicitly referring to the in-group.	The parent comment suggests frustration with the in-group team's lack of pass rush, and it indicates that the secondary (defensive backs responsible for covering receivers) has no chance if the pass rush is ineffective. In NFL terminology, referring to "the QB" generally means the quarterback of the team that the commenter supports. As such, "the QB" is likely referring to the in-group quarterback since the overall sentiment and focus is on the in-group team’s defensive struggles. Moreover, the win probability is low, indicating that the commenter’s team (Cowboys) is not doing well, reinforcing the idea that the frustration is directed at their own team’s performance in protecting their quarterback from a non-existent pass rush.  Therefore, 'the QB' should be tagged with [IN], as it implicitly refers to the in-group quarterback under pressure due to the opponent’s effective offense.	1671925944.0	cowboys	eagles	237		1.0	0.223204523324966	0.804159445407279

['[SENT]']	[(16, 22)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is responding to criticism about Bryant (a player on the in-group team, Seahawks). The commenter is defending Bryant, indicating that their expectations for a rookie player should be tempered. This defense implies that they are talking about the in-group team, the Seahawks. The presence of a rhetorical question about expectations suggests the commenter believes the criticism is unfair, further supporting the notion it is about the in-group. Hence, the second sentence implicitly refers to the in-group, and is tagged as [IN], with '[SENT]' capturing this implicit reference.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment indicates a discussion about a specific player, Bryant, who is likely a member of the Seahawks, given that the commenter is a Seahawks fan. The first sentence ("A bust ?") is questioning the assertion made in the parent comment and hence, does not explicitly mention any team or player and is left untagged. The second sentence refers to Bryant implicitly by questioning the expectations for a "4th round rookie playing one of the hardest positions in football." Given the context and the emphasis on defending a rookie's situation, it's reasonable to infer that the comment is defending the in-group player. Therefore, the entire second sentence can be tagged as [IN], even though there is no explicit mention of Bryant or the Seahawks, because it implicitly refers to the in-group. Thus, the [SENT] token for the second sentence should be tagged [IN].	1670188730.0	seahawks	rams	238		1.0	0.6359965801239009	0.07342880598376357

The critical view of the management or coach who drafted him implies familiarity and concern that is consistent with a fan of the in-group team rather than the opponent or another team. Thus, 'Fields' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team. The rest of the comment discusses general infrastructure and employment, which doesn't refer explicitly to either the in-group or the out-group, and so is not tagged.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment mentions the firing of a bad coach and implies that the infrastructure remains unchanged, suggesting frustration with the team's management. The comment discusses the people who were responsible for hiring the now dismissed personnel and how they drafted Fields. Since Fields is a player for the Bears, the in-group team, ‘Fields’ should be tagged [IN]. The win probability is low, indicating the in-group may not be performing well, which aligns with the critical tone of the comment towards the team’s past decisions. Thus, 'Fields' is correctly tagged as [IN]. The remaining sentences do not contain explicit references to an entity and do not need additional tags.	1671392970.0	bears	eagles	239		1.0	0.0723082572221756	0.563709961281239
train	q5j6wr	hg6qcn0	t3_q5j6wr	[SENT] good start , lets hope [IN] comes out pissed 	['mahomes']	[(30, 37)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is expressing a hope for Mahomes, who is a player for the Chiefs (the in-group team), to perform well. The phrase "good start" likely refers to the in-group's performance, given that fans typically express positive sentiments about their own team. Therefore, 'mahomes' should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to a key player from the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment is showing support for Mahomes, who is the quarterback for the Chiefs. Given that the Chiefs are the in-group team for the commenter, 'mahomes' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group's player. The context of hoping Mahomes comes out "pissed" implies a desire for a stronger performance, reflecting the win probability being low and a need for improvement, which aligns with the support for the in-group team.	1633922397.0	chiefs	bills	240	Pat "Kermit" Mahomes	3.0	0.223799049854279	0.703221112507441
train	qoxpfx	hjqazy9	t1_hjqarw8	[IN] Fffuuuucccckkkk 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is expressing frustration, indicated by the extended expletive "Fffuuuucccckkkk." This type of emotive reaction is typically associated with the fan's response to something negative happening to the in-group team. Since it is a reply to a question about Stokes, who is a player for the Packers (the in-group), it is reasonable to infer that this expression of frustration is directed towards a misfortune involving their own team. Therefore, the sentence should be tagged as [IN], since the anger is about something happening to the in-group team. The '[SENT]' refers to the entire sentence as there is no explicit word/phrase that refers directly to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter's expression of frustration without any explicit context is likely about the in-group team given the low win probability, which suggests the in-group team is not performing well or suffered a significant setback. The parent comment asking about Stokes, a player on the in-group (Packers), further implies that this frustration is directed towards the in-group team's situation. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1636323219.0	packers	chiefs	241		1.0	0.12544792890548695	0.25994957680533043

[IN] What the fuck do you have to lose 	['we', '[SENT]']	[(15, 17), (37, 43)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The use of the pronoun 'we' in the first sentence indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, which is the in-group, the Ravens. Fans typically use 'we' to describe or question their own team's actions. In the second sentence, the absence of any explicit in-group or out-group reference still implies frustration directed towards the in-group team since the commenter is questioning their decisions. Thus, '[SENT]' in the second sentence refers implicitly to the in-group, the Ravens. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] and '[SENT]' in the second sentence should also be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is questioning a decision made by the in-group team, the Ravens. The use of the word "we" in the first sentence indicates the commenter sees themselves as part of the team or is a fan of the team, which means "we" should be tagged as referring to the in-group [IN]. The second sentence continues this line of questioning, implicitly directed at the in-group team to push forward and take more risks, hence the [SENT] token is tagged [IN] due to the implicit reference to the Ravens. The win probability is nearly even, suggesting a close game where strategic decisions are crucial, which is in line with the commenter's frustration directed at their own team.	1641753654.0	ravens	steelers	26		7.0	0.489916741847992	0.18165108287381124

['[SENT]', 'them']	[(0, 6), (84, 88)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	The suggestion in the comment is likely referring to a strategy for the in-group team, the Bills, to better manage the clock against their opponent. The parent comment expresses frustration with the team's defensive decision-making, so it would make sense that the follow-up comment contains advice for the in-group team.  In the first sentence, there is no explicit word or phrase referring to the in-group, but the instruction "Also don't kick it into the endzone" implies advice for the Bills, so the sentence should be tagged [IN].  In the second sentence, "Kick it inside the 10 and make them waste 4 - 5 seconds on a return," the word "them" refers to the opponent team, the Chiefs, so it should be tagged [OUT]. Therefore, the overall context and instructional nature toward the in-group team (Bills) and opponent team (Chiefs) justify the targeted tags and the list of referring expressions.   The commenter is giving strategic advice presumably to the Bills, indicated by the lack of explicit team references and the context of the parent comment criticizing the defense. "them" refers to the out-group (Chiefs), while the first sentence has an implied in-group focus, thus the sentence itself is tagged [IN].	The comment is providing advice on kick-off strategy likely aimed at the in-group team, the Bills, suggesting that they should not kick the ball into the end zone but instead shorter, to make the opposing team, the Chiefs, waste more time on a return.   1. **First Sentence**: "Also do n't kick it into the endzone."     - There is no explicit in-group or out-group reference here, but the advice can be assumed to be directed towards the in-group team (Bills). The absence of specific references means the entire sentence is about the in-group team’s action implicitly.  2. **Second Sentence**: "Kick it inside the 10 and make them waste 4 - 5 seconds on a return."    - The instruction continues to advise the in-group team, with a specific action targeting the out-group team (Chiefs).     - The word "them" refers to the opponent team (Chiefs), making it tagged as [OUT].  Given the context of the parent comment and the 100% win probability indicating a critical juncture in a presumably decisive game, it’s evident the commenter is focusing on the in-group team’s decision-making to manage the game clock and ensure their victory.

['[SENT]']	[(26, 32)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is expressing strong frustration and disappointment, typically a reaction to their own team's performance. Since there is no explicit mention of the in-group team ('Patriots'), the second sentence is tagged with [IN] to indicate that the strong negative emotion is directed towards the in-group. The first sentence is neutral and does not have an entity reference, hence it remains untagged. Therefore, '[SENT]' in the second sentence is correctly tagged with [IN] to reflect the implicit reference to the Patriots' performance.	The second sentence expresses strong dissatisfaction, likely directed towards a performance issue. Given that there is a positive but not overwhelming win probability (58.6%), the commenter might be frustrated with the in-group team's performance despite the overall favorable position in the game. The explicit frustration without additional context suggests it is about the in-group team, the Patriots. Consequently, the '[SENT]' token in the second sentence is tagged with '[IN]' because the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group’s unacceptable performance without needing to explicitly mention them.	1633888284.0	patriots	texans	243		1.0	0.5862903892993929	0.27363371272693066

[SENT] did n't even glance over from my meal 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment implies that the person was unsurprised by the outcome of a kick, suggesting either a field goal or extra point was missed or made in a predictable manner. Since the commenter did not need to look away from their meal, it suggests a lack of interest due to predictability—in this case, likely because the in-group team, the Buccaneers, either missed or made the kick in a manner consistent with their past performance. There is no explicit mention of either the Buccaneers or Panthers, but the sentiment expressed fits with the in-group team's performance. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN] as the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment is referring to a missed or unsuccessfully executed kick, with the context suggesting the in-group (Buccaneers) performed poorly given the sarcastic tone and low win probability. For the first sentence, there is no explicit mention of either team, but the sarcastic nature of the comment implies frustration with their own team (in-group). Since there's an implicit focus on the in-group’s performance without specific words pointing to the in-group, we label the [SENT] token for the first sentence as [IN]. The second sentence does not explicitly reference any team or player, and it appears to be a standalone exasperation, thus it remains untagged. Therefore, '[SENT]' in the first sentence should be tagged with '[IN]' to reflect the implicit frustration with the in-group team’s performance.	1672598930.0	buccaneers	panthers	246	:co: Colorado	2.0	0.400436788797379	0.23278386745879007
train	qjtosl	hisi8vs	t3_qjtosl	[SENT] Finally they are catching up on [OUT] holding calls 🤣🤣 🤣 	['the Colts']	[(39, 48)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter is a supporter of the Titans, and they are referring to holding calls, which is a form of penalty in football. The phrase "Finally they are catching up on the Colts holding calls" implies that the commenter is happy that the officials are noticing and penalizing the opposing team's (Colts) infractions. The word 'the Colts' should therefore be tagged as [OUT] because it refers to the out-group team, the opponent of the Titans, which the commenter is against. The rest of the sentence does not mention any specific entities, so there are no additional tags needed.	EXPLANATION: The comment is pointing out and reacting to perceived penalties or infractions by the opponent, which is the Colts in this case. The phrase "they are catching up on the Colts holding calls" implies that the officials are finally noticing or penalizing the out-group team properly. 'the Colts' should be tagged with [OUT] because it directly refers to the out-group opponent, the Colts. The in-group team, the Titans, is not explicitly mentioned but the focus is on the out-group's actions, hence the correct tagging is [OUT] for 'the Colts'. The win probability being relatively low for the in-group here could indicate a close game or mild frustration, adding context to why catching penalties on the out-group is seen as noteworthy.	1635704312.0	titans	colts	247		6.0	0.443975746631622	0.35729932717884527

The phrase "this organization" refers to the in-group team, which is the Bears in this context. Since the comment does not contain any explicit mention of the opposing team or other NFL teams, "this organization" should be tagged as [IN], indicating it refers to the Bears.	EXPLANATION: The extremely low win probability suggests that the in-group team (Bears) is performing poorly. The sentiment of the comment is one of frustration and disappointment, typically directed at one's own team when they are doing badly. The phrase "this organization" implies that the commenter wants significant changes within the team they support, which, given the context, would be the Bears. Thus, "this organization" should be tagged [IN] as it references the in-group.	1662922661.0	bears	49ers	249		1.0	0.0976954773068428	0.6318431080955479

['Allen']	[(7, 12)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is a reply to a parent comment discussing 'Allen', which in the context of an NFL game, is likely referring to Josh Allen, the quarterback for the Buffalo Bills. Since the in-group team is the Bills, references to 'Allen' would naturally be tagged as [IN] since he is a player of the in-group team. Thus, 'Allen' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player. The critical view of his performance (‘should have blocked better’) is consistent with the kind of feedback a fan might give about their own team's player.	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 94.3% suggests that the in-group team (Bills) is likely doing well. The parent comment appears to be discussing Allen, who is a well-known player for the Bills. Given that the name 'Allen' is mentioned without further qualification, it is reasonable to deduce that the reference is to Josh Allen of the Bills. Hence, 'Allen' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a player on the in-group team the commenter supports, who they feel should have blocked better in that instance.	1636916660.0	bills	jets	250	:still-bill:	3.0	0.9431371688842773	0.3090680100755667

The laugh 'Lol' indicates a lighthearted comment, possibly about something humorous that happened involving their in-group player. Therefore, 'Charles' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment is focused on a player named Charles, without any negative connotations. Given the context that the in-group team is the Texans and the out-group team is the Browns, and the relatively low win probability indicating a possible struggling in-game performance for the Texans, the name 'Charles' likely refers to Charles Omenihu, an offensive player for the Texans. Because no distinction or negativity is implied, it is reasonable to tag 'Charles' as [IN] to reflect the in-group connection.	1632071113.0	texans	browns	251	:ob1:	1.0	0.10713565349578902	0.015387467556544309

['# 28', 'he', 'he']	[(26, 30), (46, 48), (85, 87)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[3, 3, 3]	 The comment is lauding the performance of #28, which implies a positive assessment typically reserved for players on the in-group team. The commenter notes that this player "runs hard as shit every single time he touches the ball," further indicating an in-group bias where players are praised for their efforts. Therefore, '#28,' 'he,' and 'he' should be tagged with [IN] as they collectively refer to a player on the in-group team, the 49ers.	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be praising a specific player, referred to as "#28," for his performance and consistency. Given the high win probability, it is likely that the commenter is focusing on a positive aspect of the in-group team's performance. The absence of any negative language and the context of praise suggests that "#28" is a player from the in-group (49ers), as fans generally highlight the strengths and efforts of players from their own team. Therefore, "#28," "he," and "he" should be tagged with [IN], reflecting that they refer to an in-group player.	1632077267.0	49ers	eagles	26		4.0	0.755982041358948	0.5845997973657548

['taylor']	[(16, 22)]	['[IN]']	[4]	 The commenter is expressing dissatisfaction with the decision to bench a player named Taylor. Given the context of sports commentary, complaints about coaching decisions are typically directed at the in-group team. Since 'Taylor' is mentioned without qualification, it suggests familiarity and insider knowledge, indicating that Taylor is a player for the Commanders, the in-group team. Therefore, 'taylor' should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The extremely low win probability of 3.1% suggests that the Commanders are performing poorly at this point in the game. The commenter criticizes the decision to bench "taylor," which suggests that Taylor is a player on the in-group team (the Commanders) whose absence they believe is negatively affecting the team's performance. Because the comment focuses on a move made by the in-group team (benching Taylor) and implies that the team's situation would be better if Taylor (presumably a key player) were playing, the reference to "taylor" should be tagged as [IN].	1672605144.0	commanders	browns	252		32.0	0.0307845510542393	0.889834702563595

The second sentence indicates the commenter is talking about their in-group team by using "We," a term fans generally reserve for the team they support. "Zach" refers to Zach Wilson, a player for the Jets, which is the in-group team, and "he" also refers to the same player (Zach Wilson), reinforcing that the commenter is talking about the in-group. Therefore, "We," "Zach," and "he" should all be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter supports the Jets, and in this context, 'We' refers to the team the commenter supports, which is the Jets, so it should be tagged [IN]. 'Zach' refers to Zach Wilson, who is a player for the Jets, making him part of the in-group, thus it should be tagged [IN]. 'he' also refers to Zach Wilson and should be tagged [IN] for the same reason. The win probability being close to even suggests the game is competitive, and the parent comment refers to a potential change in quarterback, which prompts the clarification comment that supports the reliance on the current in-group quarterback (Zach Wilson).	1671760458.0	jets	jaguars	254	:OtherIHateThisTeam:	1.0	0.488184034824371	0.2196749854904237

The phrases 'This team' and 'the head coach' are meant to refer to the in-group team, which in this case is the Vikings. Additionally, Mike Zimmer is known as the head coach of the Vikings, and the call to 'Fire Zimmer' further confirms that the commenter is unhappy with aspects of their own team. Therefore, all references to entities ('This team', 'the head coach', 'Zimmer') are correctly tagged as [IN], representing the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The low win probability indicates that the in-group team, the Vikings, is likely performing poorly. The comment criticizes "This team" and mentions "the head coach," which without specification refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. The call to "Fire Zimmer" is about Mike Zimmer, the head coach of the Vikings. Hence, "This team," "the head coach," and "Zimmer" all refer to the in-group and should be tagged with [IN].	1636317982.0	vikings	ravens	26		14.0	0.095546776449425	0.7788812966788495

['McVay', 'his QB']	[(41, 46), (72, 78)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment is about why the "streak is in jeopardy", and it refers to two individuals associated with the Rams, the in-group: Coach Sean McVay and the quarterback (QB). McVay (head coach) is being criticized for his play-calling, and the QB is described as having a terrible game. "McVay" should be tagged [IN] because he is the head coach of the Rams, the team the commenter supports. "his QB" should also be tagged [IN] as it refers to the quarterback of the Rams, creating the sense that both entities mentioned are part of the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter supports the Rams, and Sean McVay is the head coach of the Rams, making 'McVay' an in-group reference. The phrase 'his QB' refers to the quarterback Matthew Stafford, who also plays for the Rams, hence 'his QB' is tagged as [IN]. Despite the high win probability, the commenter focuses on the immediate issue of the play-calling and the QB's performance, which they find problematic, thus 'McVay' and 'his QB' should both be tagged as referring to the in-group.	1640548463.0	rams	vikings	257	Blue & Yellow #62	1.0	0.714668892873974	0.6182875069200959
train	prf6bi	hdiw1cq	t3_prf6bi	[OTHER] Such bull shit 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The comment "Such bull shit" is vague in terms of specifying which team's action is being referred to. There's no explicit mention of the in-group (Seahawks) or out-group (Titans), nor is there any context that directly implicates either side. Hence, this comment is tagged as [OTHER] to indicate that it refers generically to something that the commenter perceives as unjust or unfair, without attributing this perception explicitly to either the in-group or out-group. The entire sentence is tagged because the comment's complaint is general and does not contain specific entities.	EXPLANATION: The comment "Such bull shit" does not provide any explicit entity to tag. Given the high win probability of 81.1% for the in-group (Seahawks), it's less likely that a fan is expressing frustration towards the in-group team. Also, since the out-group (Titans) is not directly mentioned or contextually implicated, this comment could be reflecting a general frustration about the game or officiating rather than a specific team. Therefore, tagging the sentence as [OTHER] is the safest option, as it doesn't clearly pertain to either in-group or out-group entities.	1632092827.0	seahawks	titans	258	:sea1:​	2.0	0.811014741659164	0.7838558500323206

['the refs', '[SENT]']	[(36, 44), (47, 53)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing frustration about the officiating in the game. The term 'the refs' are neutral and applies to officials not belonging to either team, thus should be tagged with [OTHER]. The sentence "[SENT] Drive killed by a joke of a call" implies a context related to the in-group, referring to a drive being negatively affected, but does not mention an explicit entity; therefore, it should not contain an entity-specific tag. The rest of the comments are general complaints about the officiating without specific reference to the in-group, out-group, or other teams. Therefore, the remaining sentences should be tagged with the general [SENT] without any specific entity reference.	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses frustration with the referees due to perceived bad calls against the in-group team (Commanders). The win probability is relatively low, which may contribute to the commenter’s irritation. The term "the refs" is referring to the referees in general, which in this context is better tagged as [OTHER] since referees are neither part of the in-group or out-group. The sentences "Getting absolutely fucked by the refs" and "Drive killed by a joke of a call" both imply issues with the referees, but they don't explicitly mention either the in-group or out-group; hence, "[SENT]" is tagged as [OTHER] for these two sentences.	1670183656.0	commanders	giants	259		7.0	0.268035769462585	0.5525577557755775

[SENT] [IN] looks downright awful 	['Elum', 'him', 'He']	[(51, 55), (91, 94), (106, 108)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The comment indicates some level of hope for Elum, suggesting that the commenter had expectations for him, which is more likely for a player on the in-group team. The comment also critiques Elum’s performance harshly, where such strong opinions are typically reserved for players on the team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Elum', 'him', and 'He' should be tagged with [IN] since these pronouns and name refer to a player in the in-group, the Raiders.	EXPLANATION: The comment discusses a player named Elum who has had a rough series and looks awful. Given that the Raiders are the in-group team and the commenter has some hope for the player, it is reasonable to assume Elum is a player on the Raiders. Even though the win probability for the in-group Raiders is relatively high, fans often discuss and critique individual performances regardless of the overall game situation. The entities 'Elum', 'him', and 'He' all refer to this player on the in-group team, thus they should be tagged with [IN].	1663533291.0	raiders	cardinals	260		1.0	0.707570970058441	0.04450514138817481

['his']	[(44, 47)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The parent comment mentions a player named 'bynes' who is presumably a player on the Ravens team (the in-group). In the current comment, 'his face' is a continuation of the topic about Bynes, indicating that 'his' refers to an in-group player who is part of the Ravens. Therefore, 'his' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment mentions 'bynes', who is a player on the Ravens, the in-group team the commenter supports. The current comment is discussing the state of 'bynes' after the injury, suggesting that it "looks fine" and attributing the injury to "just grass kicked up in his face". Given the win probability is relatively high for the in-group, the comment likely has an optimistic tone about their own team (Ravens). Since 'his' refers to the in-group player 'bynes', it should be tagged with [IN].	1635096389.0	ravens	bengals	261		2.0	0.664709120988846	0.12279494019447552

Hilton, who is a wide receiver for the Colts, the team the commenter supports. Hence, 'ty Hilton' is tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. There are no other entities or groups mentioned in this sentence.	EXPLANATION: 'ty Hilton' is a player for the Colts, which is the in-group team that the commenter supports. The win probability is very high at 100%, indicating that the Colts are almost certain to win and the commenter is appreciating a good play made by a player from the in-group team. Hence, 'ty Hilton' should be tagged with [IN].	1634512466.0	colts	texans	262	Carson Wentz	4.0	1.0	1.0

['KC', 'we', 'the Bills']	[(49, 51), (56, 58), (83, 92)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5, 5]	 In this comment, "KC" and "we" both refer to the in-group team, which is the Chiefs. The commenter is discussing how the Chiefs are perceived and is expressing frustration about their team not being respected. Therefore, "KC" and "we" should be tagged [IN] since they refer to the in-group. The "Bills" are another team in the NFL, but they are not the Titans, who are the out-group opponent in this context. Thus, "the Bills" should be tagged [OTHER] as they are a team in the NFL that is neither the in-group nor the out-group in this game.	EXPLANATION: 'KC' and 'we' both refer to the in-group team, which is the Chiefs. The commenter expresses frustration about how their team is perceived, and 'we' commonly refers to the in-group. 'KC' is a common abbreviation for Kansas City, representing the Chiefs. 'the Bills' refers to neither the in-group nor the out-group team but another team in the NFL, so it is correctly tagged as [OTHER]. The win probability being slightly above 50% indicates a fairly even game, adding to the context of the comment about respect and underdog status.	1667788172.0	chiefs	titans	266	Priest Holmes	0.0	0.55721777677536	0.32216432865731465

[SENT] [IN] half assed the catch 	['[SENT]', 'Waller']	[(0, 6), (33, 39)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	The commenter is defending the quarterback (Carr) and placing the blame on the receiver (Waller), which indicates that the commenter is likely referring to in-group players. In the first sentence, even though 'Was a good pass ..' does not explicitly mention anyone, it implicitly defends the in-group quarterback, thus '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, 'Waller' is a player for the Raiders (in-group team), so his name should be tagged as [IN]. This analysis aligns with the context provided in the parent comment, where the discussion is about the abilities of the in-group quarterback.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment criticizes the QB, Carr, of the in-group team (Raiders), and the commenter here defends the pass by saying "Was a good pass." The reference to "Waller" is about Darren Waller, a player on the Raiders team (in-group), who they say "half assed the catch." Despite the low win probability indicating the in-group is losing, the commenter is still talking about their own team and criticizes Waller for not making a better effort. Hence, the sentence "Was a good pass .." implicitly refers to the in-group and should be tagged [IN], and "Waller" should also be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	1664129158.0	raiders	titans	267		3.0	0.24480867385864302	0.33626666666666666

['Boyle', 'He']	[(36, 41), (57, 59)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter expresses sadness about a block by Boyle, suggesting an emotional connection that is more typical for a fan of the in-group team. Boyle is a player for the Ravens, so 'Boyle' in the first sentence and 'He' in the second sentence both refer to the in-group. Therefore, they should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears saddened by a block involving Boyle, who is a player for the Ravens, the in-group team. Using Boyle's name without additional qualifiers typically suggests familiarity and association with the in-group team the commenter supports, especially since the commenter expresses sadness over the incident, which is an emotional investment more likely directed towards their own team's players. In the second sentence, 'He' refers to Boyle, and thus it should also be tagged as [IN] since it is referring to an in-group player. Therefore, 'Boyle' and 'He' are correctly tagged [IN], referring to the Ravens player.	1666917564.0	ravens	buccaneers	268	:ED: Ed Reed	4.0	0.281045079231262	0.12669039145907474

['he', 'he']	[(88, 90), (100, 102)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	The parent comment refers to Baker Mayfield, who is a player for the Browns, discussing his injury and expressing concern about his condition. The subsequent comment continues this discussion, reflecting a belief that Mayfield won't be able to come back healthy within the same season if he requires surgery. The use of "he" twice in the second sentence is clearly referring to Mayfield. Since Mayfield is a member of the in-group team (Browns), both instances of "he" should be tagged as [IN].	The parent comment discusses Baker Mayfield, who is a player for the Browns, the in-group team. The follow-up comment continues this discussion, focusing on whether Mayfield can recover from his injury within the same season. The win probability is slightly in favor of the in-group, which might be why the commenter is invested in future performance and recovery.  In the second sentence, "he" in "If he 's out," and "he" in "he 's done for the year" refer to Mayfield. Therefore, these should be tagged as [IN] since Mayfield is a player for the in-group team.  Thus, the expressions "he" in both occurrences should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group team player, Mayfield. The two sentences have no explicit references to out-group or other entities, further supporting the tagging of "he" as the in-group player Mayfield.	1635704929.0	browns	steelers	271	:rally-opposum:	0.0	0.565474361181259	0.4777111213659437

['He', 'he', 'Higgins']	[(7, 9), (26, 28), (78, 85)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter is replying to a question about Odell Beckham Jr. (OBJ), who plays for the Browns, indicating that the discussion is about in-group players. 'He' and 'he' both refer to OBJ, who is an in-group player for the Browns, and thus should be tagged [IN]. 'Higgins' is also a player for the Browns, making 'Higgins' and the associated acronym 'td' both in-group references, thus they should both be tagged [IN]. The whole sentence is related to evaluating the performance of these in-group players.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment reveals that the discussion is about OBJ (Odell Beckham Jr.), who was a player for the Browns, the in-group team. Therefore, 'He' and 'he' in the first part of the sentence refer to OBJ and should be tagged [IN]. The mention of Higgins, another player for the Browns, in the context of a touchdown ('Higgins td') also indicates it is a reference to the in-group team, thus 'Higgins' should be tagged [IN] as well. The win probability being relatively low suggests the commenter may be evaluating the overall impact of their players critically, further cementing the references as addressing in-group players. The phrases about double teams opening up opportunities and the specific mention of a touchdown by an in-group player imply that the assessment is focused on the contributions of Browns players.	1633899750.0	browns	chargers	272	:browns:	1.0	0.463081270456314	0.28576197629778

['Cooper Rush', 'Dallas', 'the refs']	[(7, 18), (40, 46), (64, 72)]	['[OUT]', '[OUT]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter is an Eagles fan, and this comment is about Cooper Rush, a quarterback for the Cowboys, the opposing team. Therefore, 'Cooper Rush' should be tagged [OUT]. Similarly, 'Dallas' refers to the Cowboys, which are also the out-group, so it should be tagged [OUT]. 'the refs' is not related to either the in-group or out-group teams but refers to officials who are neutral. Therefore, 'the refs' should be tagged [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: The commenter supports the Eagles, and the Cowboys are the opponents. With a high win probability for the Eagles, the commenter is complaining about Cooper Rush, who is the quarterback for the Cowboys. 'Cooper Rush' and 'Dallas' both refer to entities from the out-group (Cowboys), so they should be tagged as [OUT]. The phrase 'the refs' refers to the referees, who are neutral and not affiliated with either team, thus it should be tagged as [OTHER].	1665976071.0	eagles	cowboys	273	we can talk this out	3.0	0.979727149009705	0.9145053723601334

['Walker', '[SENT]']	[(52, 58), (69, 75)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is criticizing a specific player for making a mistake, which in this context implies they are talking about an incident involving their own team, the in-group. 'Walker' is tagged [IN] because the commenter's criticism is directed towards a player from the in-group team, the Lions, indicating disappointment or frustration with their own team's player's action. The second sentence continues this line of thought, addressing the player's poor decision directly. Thus, '[SENT]' for the second sentence should also be tagged with [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group player’s action being criticized.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the Lions is quite low, suggesting they may have made more mistakes and are likely losing. Taunting is seen as detrimental behavior to a team's performance, and the comment “Why are you taunting while the play is still live?” implies frustration likely aimed at the in-group team’s player, Walker. Therefore, 'Walker' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player on the Lions. Given that the win probability is low and the tone of the comment is critical, the entire second sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group, indicating frustration with their performance. Thus, '[SENT]' should also be tagged with [IN].	1634491911.0	lions	bengals	275		11.0	0.214971989393234	0.16698184568835098

The comment attributes luck to the in-group team in a tone that seems playful rather than disparaging, indicating support. Hence, 'Pats' is tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The word 'Pats' is a common shorthand for the New England Patriots, who are the in-group team the commenter supports. This comment is likely made in a positive light, given the high win probability, indicating the Patriots are doing well. Therefore, 'Pats' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team.	1663527917.0	patriots	steelers	276		2.0	0.7250044941902161	0.6939448158960354

Hence, 'They' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team (Titans) in the context of the commenter's perspective as a Packers supporter.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the in-group, Packers, is relatively low, suggesting they may be struggling in the current game. The comment "They damn near killed the whole quarter" is likely referring to the out-group, Titans, since it is common for fans to blame the opponent for consuming a lot of time, especially if the opponent is playing well and controlling the game. The use of 'They' without further qualification typically points to the out-group in such contexts. Thus, 'They' should be tagged [OUT] as it likely refers to the Titans.	1668737202.0	packers	titans	278		8.0	0.416414856910706	0.2831264367816092

[IN] Not perfect but improved for sure 	['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (60, 66)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The parent comment asks about Hurts, a player for the Eagles, which means the follow-up comment is evaluating his performance. Since the assessment ('Mixed play but overall...pretty well' and 'Not perfect but improved for sure') is directed toward Hurts and thus implicitly the in-group team (Eagles), both sentences should be tagged as [IN]. Each '[SENT]' here captures the full context of each sentence as referring to the in-group evaluation without explicit mention of the team or player.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing their feelings about Jalen Hurts, who is a player for the in-group team, the Eagles. Since the commenter is responding to the parent comment, which asks about Hurts' performance, their feedback indicates that they view his play overall positively, even if it's not perfect. The high win probability also suggests that the Eagles are performing well, making it more likely that the comment is focused on their in-group team. Therefore, both sentences in the comment are implicitly referring to Jalen Hurts' performance, thus they should be tagged with [IN], and since there are no explicit referring expressions, the '[SENT]' tags are correct.	1662922016.0	eagles	lions	279	Reed Blankenship Truther	1.0	0.919815219938755	0.5264012303485988
train	qmy6bk	hjcuxtr	t3_qmy6bk	[SENT] Gotta love [IN] 	['our dogshit pass D']	[(18, 36)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The phrase 'our dogshit pass D' is a critical remark about the defensive performance (specifically the pass defense) of the in-group team, which the commenter supports. The use of "our" indicates that the commenter is a supporter of the Colts, making this reference an in-group mention. Since the comment is only criticizing their own team's performance and does not explicitly mention the out-group team (Jets), only 'our dogshit pass D' is tagged as in-group. Therefore, "[SENT]" should be tagged as "[IN]" because the entire comment implicitly refers to the in-group team (Colts).	EXPLANATION: The phrase "our dogshit pass D" is a critical remark about the passing defense of the team the commenter supports. The use of "our" clearly indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, which is the Colts in this context. With a high win probability of 88.0%, it suggests that while the Colts are doing well overall, the commenter still finds a specific aspect of their team's performance, the pass defense, to be lacking. Hence, "our dogshit pass D" should be tagged [IN] to denote that it refers to the in-group team.	1636073159.0	colts	jets	280		4.0	0.880033619701862	0.12309434619740396

['our fucking defense', '[SENT]']	[(18, 37), (48, 54)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing frustration with their own team's defense, which is an indication of the in-group. The phrase "our fucking defense" explicitly refers to the in-group, so it should be tagged with [IN]. In the second sentence, "This is utterly pathetic" is a continuation of the thought about the in-group's poor performance, thus the [SENT] token should also be tagged with [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group's performance.	The commenter expresses frustration and criticism in both sentences. The first sentence uses 'our fucking defense,' which explicitly shows that the commenter is talking about the Browns' defense, thus tagging it as [IN]. The second sentence, while not explicitly mentioning the team, maintains the context of the previous sentence by calling the same subject ('defense') 'utterly pathetic.' Hence, the sentiment carries over and should be tagged as [IN] since it continues to express frustration towards the in-group team. Thus, '[SENT]' in the second part of the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team's ongoing poor performance.	1632079545.0	browns	texans	281	:browns:	10.0	0.896975887729558	0.7969966629588432

Therefore, 'Ben Johnson' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group member. The rest of the sentence is about his condition, which doesn't introduce any new entities to tag.	EXPLANATION: The comment states that Ben Johnson is out for the game due to a brain injury. Given that the in-group team is the Lions and Ben Johnson is a member of that team, the comment is referring to an in-group player. With a win probability of 41.6%, it is plausible that the commenter is understandably concerned about the well-being of their player. Hence, 'Ben Johnson' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Lions).	1668367753.0	lions	bears	284	I wanna die	3.0	0.415926873683929	0.49051260266213537

['They', 'us']	[(130, 134), (140, 142)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The context indicates that the commenter is discussing a scenario where the other team (out-group) could have executed a play that would have ended the game but did not, hence giving the in-group a chance. In the first sentence, "these people" refers to in-group team members or fans, but it does not mention the in-group explicitly, so no tags are applied. In the second sentence, "They" refers to the out-group opponent (Cardinals) who gave the in-group team (Vikings) a chance by making a decision that didn’t end the game. Therefore, "They" should be tagged [OUT]. "us" refers to the commenter’s in-group team (Vikings), so it should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The parent comment reveals frustration about taking unnecessary risks, which suggests that the commenter is concerned about their own team, the Vikings. In the current comment, 'They' refers to the Cardinals (the out-group team) because it implies that the out-group's actions had a consequence that involved the in-group. The phrase 'us' refers to the Vikings (the in-group team) since the commenter states that 'They gave us a chance,' indicating the Cardinals' actions led to a positive opportunity for the Vikings. Therefore, 'They' should be tagged as [OUT] and 'us' should be tagged as [IN] to accurately reflect the entities being referred to.	1632094239.0	vikings	cardinals	285		2.0	1.0	1.0

['Eagles', 'Hurts', '[SENT]']	[(22, 28), (58, 63), (159, 165)]	['[OUT]', '[OUT]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter is making a disparaging remark about the Eagles fans and player, which suggests that the Eagles are the out-group (opponent). In the first sentence, 'Eagles' and 'Hurts' are explicitly mentioned, thus both should be tagged [OUT] as 'Eagles' refers to the opponent team and 'Hurts' is a player on that team. The second sentence does not contain explicit mentions, but given the context, it continues to discuss the Eagles fans, implicitly referring to the out-group, so the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged [OUT]. The third sentence also continues in the same vein, implicitly mocking the Eagles fans by referring to a cheesesteak being warmed (a regional food from Philadelphia, home of the Eagles), thus '[SENT]' in the third sentence should also be tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a Cowboys fan (in-group), commenting on the opponent Eagles (out-group). The first sentence references Eagles fans and Hurts jerseys, both of which are related to the out-group. 'Eagles' and 'Hurts' are tagged [OUT] since they refer to Eagles players and fans.   The second sentence is a continuation of the disparaging tone towards the Eagles' situation, building on the first sentence's mention of Eagles fans. Therefore, 'outside the stadium' implies an Eagles-related context.  In the third sentence, the reference to 'a cheesesteak' is a nod to a well-known Philadelphia (home of the Eagles) food item, thus further implicating the out-group context.   Overall, the sentences are disparaging towards the Eagles, suggesting that the comment is referring to the Eagles even when explicit names aren't mentioned. Thus, all the referring expressions are correctly tagged as [OUT], including the third sentence as [SENT].	1632794670.0	cowboys	eagles	286		10.0	0.964071378111839	0.5708509142053446

'We' and 'our offense' both refer to in-group, given it’s common for fans to use such pronouns when talking about their team. 'Jimmy' refers to Jimmy Garoppolo, the 49ers quarterback, so it is tagged as [IN]. ‘Refball’ refers to the refereeing which is being described as one-sided but not specifying which side it's in favor of, hence it is tagged as [OTHER]. The third sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team’s situation, so the [SENT] token is tagged [IN] since it discusses the missing starters on the 49ers defense.	The commenter is a 49ers fan and their win probability is extremely low, indicating they're likely losing.   1. 'We' and 'our offense' clearly refer to the in-group (49ers) as the commenter is talking about their own team's offensive struggles. 2. 'Jimmy' refers to Jimmy Garoppolo, a quarterback for the 49ers, thus tagged [IN]. 3. 'Refball' refers to the officiating of the game. The term usually implies biased or poor refereeing. Here, the commenter says ‘Refball was a bit one sided too,’ suggesting officiating favored the other team. Since the opponent is the Falcons, 'Refball' is tagged [OUT] indicating the bias benefits the out-group. 4. The sentence 'These games will happen if you are missing 8 starters on defense' implicitly refers to the 49ers, who are suffering from injuries, hence '.' should be tagged [IN].  Therefore, the target tags and referring expressions are correctly assigned to indicate that the comment focuses on the in-group's performance and challenges, with a mention of biased officiating in favor of the out-group.	1665949598.0	49ers	falcons	287	:shanahan: Kyle Shanahan	3.0	0.0006963014602660023	0.964719717757742

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The parent comment refers to a key role (‘C calls the protections’) within the in-group team, the Saints, indicating a focus on their performance. In the context of live, online sports comments, a statement about not doing a good job today is likely a critique of the performance of the in-group team or player, as fans tend to discuss their own team's shortcomings. Since the comment does not explicitly mention any specific entity but is implicitly critical of the in-group team, the entire sentence is tagged with [IN], indicating it refers to the in-group, Saints. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN], reflecting the in-group criticism.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment indicates that the criticism is directed towards the Saints' center (C) who is responsible for calling the protections. Given the exceedingly low win probability of 0.1%, it is evident that the Saints, the in-group team, did not perform well. Therefore, the commenter is more likely criticizing their own team. Since there is no explicit mention of a team, player, or subgroup within the sentence, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' to indicate that the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Saints.	1632081466.0	saints	panthers	288		0.0	0.0006360411643979713	0.9249516100651065

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The parent comment is criticizing the referees for favoring the Giants (the out-group) over the Eagles (the in-group). The given comment expresses agreement with the parent comment. Since the comment does not contain any explicit words or phrases that refer to the in-group or out-group, the entire sentence should be tagged as [OTHER]. The comment itself does not directly address either team, thus '[SENT]' is tagged with [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: The parent comment expresses concern that the referees are biased in favor of 'ny,' which likely refers to the New York Giants, the out-group team. However, the current comment does not explicitly mention either team or provide context specific to the in-group (Eagles) or out-group (Giants). Given that the comment lacks direct references to teams or players, it is tagged as [OTHER] to indicate the lack of explicit in-group or out-group context in this specific statement. '[SENT]' is tagged as [OTHER] because the sentence is general and could apply to any scenario, not specifically to the Eagles or Giants.	1673223329.0	eagles	giants	289		1.0	0.996566141489893	0.9642248722316865

The commenter's excitement and use of a nickname suggest a supportive stance toward Herbert, indicating that the commenter is a fan of the Chargers. Therefore, "HERBOOOOO" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player, and there are no other explicit references in the comment.	EXPLANATION: The comment "HERBOOOOO" is likely cheering for Justin Herbert, the quarterback of the Chargers. Since the commenter supports the Chargers (the in-group), and "HERBOOOOO" is a positive expression presumably directed towards Herbert, it should be tagged [IN]. The low win probability doesn't contradict this interpretation, as fans often cheer for individual plays or players regardless of the overall game context. Thus the word "HERBOOOOO" is referring to an in-group player, making [IN] the correct tag.	1664142789.0	chargers	jaguars	290	Chargers	2.0	0.460992455482483	0.603796521413877

In this context, 'Bengals' refers to the in-group team, which is tagged as [IN]. The term 'refs' refers to the referees who are considered a neutral or third-party entity and not directly part of the game between the two teams (Bengals and 49ers), hence it is tagged as [OTHER]. This aligns with the sentiment that the commenter believes external factors (the referees) are influencing the game's fairness.	The comment expresses frustration with the officiating during the game, which is causing the in-group team, the Bengals, to lose. Despite the game being between the Bengals and the 49ers, 'refs' refers to the referees, who are seen as a distinct group impacting the game negatively for the Bengals. Because the refs are not part of the opponent team or any specific team, they should be tagged as [OTHER]. The Bengals are explicitly mentioned and should be tagged as [IN] since the commenter is a fan of the Bengals. Therefore, 'Bengals' is tagged [IN] and 'refs' is tagged [OTHER] in this context.	1639349493.0	bengals	49ers	291		5.0	0.144632935523987	0.42775523722778835

['we', 'This one']	[(12, 14), (59, 67)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing frustration with their team's coaching staff, which is something fans typically do about their own in-group team rather than the opponent. 'we' is a term used by fans to refer to their own team (the in-group), in this case, the Broncos. 'This one' is referring to the coaching staff, which is also part of the in-group team that the commenter supports. Therefore, 'we' and 'This one' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group team in this context.	EXPLANATION: 'We' typically refers to the in-group, which in this case is the Broncos. Since the commenter is discussing the need for an entirely new coaching staff, it is likely they are referring to their own team's coaching staff. The second sentence, 'This one is steaming garbage,' follows directly from the first sentence and is describing the current state of the in-group's coaching staff, hence 'This one' is also referring to the Broncos' coaching staff. Therefore, both 'we' and 'This one' should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1634507667.0	broncos	raiders	292		1.0	0.28527644276619	0.46860454904715904

Each reference has been tagged appropriately based on the context.  1. 'Mooney' refers to Charvarius Ward, a player for the 49ers, hence it’s tagged [IN]. 2. 'the roster' refers to the 49ers' team, so it’s tagged [IN]. 3. 'CMC' refers to Christian McCaffrey, another player for the 49ers, thus it’s tagged [IN]. 4. '…he' refers to 'CMC', so it should also be tagged [IN]. 5. 'our offense' refers to the 49ers' performance, so it is tagged [IN]. 6. 'our D' signifies the in-group's defense, thus tagged [IN]. 7. 'Moody' is a typo or confusion with 'Mooney', and it should be tagged [IN] as it's used in context referring to the 49ers. 8. 'we' multiple times indicates the in-group, the 49ers. 9.

Given the context provided in the parent comment and the win probability, the commenter appears to be a 49ers fan (in-group). Here's a breakdown of how entities are tagged:  - 'Mooney' refers to the in-group player Mooney Ward. Since the initial comment is about Mooney being an upgrade, it's reasonable to tag this entity as [IN]. - 'the roster' refers to the 49ers roster, which should be tagged as [IN] since it involves the in-group team. - 'CMC' is an abbreviation for Christian McCaffrey, another key player for the 49ers. Hence, this should be tagged as [IN]. - '…he' refers back to 'CMC', so it should also be tagged as [IN]. - 'our offense' refers to the offense of the in-group team, the 49ers. So, this should be tagged as [IN]. - 'our D' refers to the in-group team's defense. Thus, it should be tagged as [IN]. - 'Moody' is another reference to Mooney, who is an in-group player, so it should be tagged as	1671161765.0	49ers	seahawks	293	:helmet2: 49ers	2.0	0.970275990664959	0.7792867701404287

[SENT] That was a very necessary long timeout needed 	['he', 'his defense']	[(12, 14), (34, 45)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	The commenter is likely discussing a decision made by a member of the in-group team, which is suggested by the qualifier 'his defense' referring to the team's defense. This implies that 'he' refers to the coach or a leader in the in-group team (Bears). The statement about needing a long timeout indicates an understanding of the tactical necessity that aligns with supporting the in-group's strategic decisions. Thus, 'he' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a coach or prominent player from the Bears, and 'his defense' should also be tagged [IN] since it refers to the Bears' defense unit. The second sentence is a general comment about the necessity of the timeout and does not explicitly mention any team or individual, so no additional tagging is required in that sentence.	The parent comment suggests frustration over a challenge that the in-group team (Bears) made, implying that 'Dude he challenged' refers to the coach or a player on the Bears. The phrase 'his defense' refers to the in-group defense that needed a break due to the challenge. Despite the high win probability indicating the Bears are likely to win, the commenter focuses on a tactical decision made by their in-group team. Therefore, 'he' and 'his defense' are tagged with [IN] to reflect their reference to the in-group. The second sentence is a general statement about the timeout and does not explicitly refer to any team, so no additional tags are necessary there.	1633905865.0	bears	raiders	294		1.0	0.7327286005020139	0.8534745914885976

The comment is likely made by a Chiefs fan expressing frustration or concern about their own quarterback's performance in the game. Hence, "Pat" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player that the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment is referring to 'Pat,' which likely refers to Patrick Mahomes, the quarterback for the Chiefs, who are the in-group team that the commenter supports. The use of the first name 'Pat' indicates familiarity and support, typical of how fans refer to key players on their team. Since the commenter believes that 'Pat' needs to improve his play, it is clear they are referring to an in-group player. Therefore, 'Pat' should be tagged as [IN].	1669001595.0	chiefs	chargers	295		2.0	0.376690208911896	0.7347569542006182

['We', 'O - line']	[(7, 9), (39, 47)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter uses "We" to refer to the team they support, which is the Bills. Therefore, "We" is tagged as [IN]. The reference to "this O-line" indicates that the commenter is criticizing the offensive line of their own team, hence "O - line" should also be tagged as [IN]. The expression of frustration and pessimism ("ain't winning shit") is directed towards their own team, further validating that "We" and "O - line" refer to the in-group team, the Bills. The second sentence "Goodnight" doesn't reference any specific entity, so it doesn't need a tag in this context.	EXPLANATION: The term "We" usually refers to the in-group, especially when expressing dissatisfaction with the team's performance. Despite the high win probability, the commenter is focusing on a specific aspect of the game - the offensive line, which they feel has not performed well. "O - line" refers to the offensive line of the in-group, the Bills, as indicated by the negative comment (fans are typically harder on their own team). Therefore, both "We" and "O - line" should be tagged with [IN]. The second sentence, "Goodnight," does not have an explicit in-group or out-group reference, hence it is not tagged.	1637894700.0	bills	saints	296	22	2.0	0.9301872551441193	0.45692735212385865

['Diontae', 'Dudes']	[(13, 20), (30, 35)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is a Steelers fan, and Diontae is likely Diontae Johnson, a player for the Steelers. The commenter is expressing dissatisfaction with a player from their own team, hence 'Bench Diontae' and 'Dudes ass' are criticisms of an in-group player. 'Diontae' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group player, and 'Dudes' should also be tagged [IN] since it also refers to Diontae Johnson, the same in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The comment demonstrates frustration directed towards a specific player, in this case, Diontae (a member of the Steelers), whom the commenter wants to bench. Given that the win probability is relatively high for the Steelers, this suggests that the commenter may have high expectations and is disappointed by the performance of Diontae. The reference to "Dudes" is a slang way of referring to Diontae, reinforcing the same sentiment. Since Diontae is part of the in-group team, both 'Diontae' and 'Dudes' should be tagged with [IN].	1669693545.0	steelers	colts	297		1.0	0.639960765838623	0.8403966694732903

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is agreeing with the parent comment, which talks about the presence of many Eagles fans in the stadium, making it sound like a home game. Since the commenter supports the Eagles and the sentiment is about the environment becoming like an in-group home game, the sentiment in the comment is implicitly about the in-group (Eagles). Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN], even though there is no explicit reference to the in-group team in the sentence.	The comment is implicitly referring to the in-group, as suggested by the parent comment mentioning a large presence of Eagles fans at the game and asking how the atmosphere sounds on TV. Given that the win probability indicates a high chance of the in-group winning (95.7%), it is reasonable to assume that the "home game" atmosphere being described is attributed to the support from Eagles fans, even if they are actually playing at the Cardinals' home stadium. Thus, the entire sentence here should be tagged with [IN], since the implicit reference is about the atmosphere created by the in-group fans, and there is no explicit entity mentioned. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as it refers to the in-group team, the Eagles.	1665350401.0	eagles	cardinals	298		2.0	0.9573881886899471	0.31573877865536504

['we']	[(95, 97)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter uses "we", which almost always refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. In this context, "we" is referring to a hypothetical situation where the in-group team, the Eagles, decides to go for it on fourth down and fails to convert. This indicates that the commenter is discussing the strategy and potential outcomes for their own team, so "we" should be correctly tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter uses 'we' to refer to the team they support, which is the in-group team, the Eagles. The use of 'we' is a common way for fans to refer to their own team. Additionally, the low win probability indicates the in-group team, the Eagles, is likely losing, which aligns with the strategic consideration mentioned in the comment about going for it on fourth down. This context supports tagging 'we' as [IN] since it clearly refers to the in-group team.	1633285706.0	eagles	chiefs	299	Kings of the NFC	3.0	0.10283899307251	0.45525874988979986

['The Bears', 'the fucking Bears']	[(7, 16), (23, 40)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing frustration about their team, the Bears. Since both mentions of 'the Bears' refer to the in-group team that the commenter supports, they should be tagged with [IN]. The use of derogatory language ('fucking Bears' and 'shitshow') indicates dissatisfaction but does not change the fact that the references are to the in-group team. The second sentence expresses a sentiment about the situation but doesn't specify an entity, so it is not tagged here. The references 'The Bears' and 'the fucking Bears' are correctly tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is a criticism of the Bears' performance during the game, indicated by the phrase "the fucking Bears" and the description of the situation as a "shitshow." The commenter is likely a Bears fan, as established by the context and the in-group being the Bears. Even though the language is harsh, fans often express frustration with their own team's poor performance, especially when the win probability is low, as indicated by the 26.9% win probability. Therefore, "The Bears" and "the fucking Bears" both refer to the in-group team and should be tagged with [IN]. The second sentence is a general statement about the situation and doesn't explicitly reference any team.	1634495669.0	bears	packers	302	GSH	2.0	0.268745362758636	0.509841973939562

Harrison Butker is the kicker for the Chiefs, so 'Butker' should be tagged [IN] since he is part of the in-group team. The word 'we' is used by the commenter to refer to their own team, the Chiefs, and thus should also be tagged [IN]. The overall sentiment of concern and strategizing is typical for fans discussing their own team's situation.	The commenter is a supporter of the Chiefs, and the win probability is high, indicating the in-group team is likely winning. 'Butker' is a kicker for the Chiefs, so this term should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. The use of 'we' here typically refers to the in-group team as well, indicating that the commenter is discussing a strategy for the Chiefs to potentially secure their lead by running out the game clock. Thus, 'Butker' and 'we' should be tagged with [IN].	1662932839.0	chiefs	cardinals	90	Patrick Mahomes #2	1.0	0.9660195112228394	0.4505433268319866

[IN] But the pass concepts themselves were absolutely awful , that 's what you should be complaining about . 	['we', 'we', 'He', '[SENT]']	[(14, 16), (35, 37), (83, 85), (132, 138)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5, 5]	 The comment is a discussion in support of the Ravens and their strategy.  - The first sentence refers to the in-group (Ravens) with the phrase 'we', indicating that if 'we get stuffed there after no timeouts', they score 0 points. As 'we' is a pronoun often used by fans to refer to their own team, it should be tagged [IN]. - The second sentence continues with the phrase 'He was absolutely right to call 3 passes there', praising Ravens' decision-makers, likely referring to the Ravens' offensive coordinator or a coach. 'He' is tagged as [IN] since it respects the context of giving credit to an in-group member. - The third sentence criticizes the pass concepts, implying it was part of the in-group's strategy. The complaining tone towards tactical decisions without switching the focus maintains the in-group context. Hence, '[SENT]' indicates that the third sentence is about the in-group, carrying the negative sentiment (implicitly referring to in-group tactics), needing to be tagged [IN].	The parent comment mentions Roman, who is a reference to Greg Roman, the offensive coordinator for the Ravens, the in-group team. The win probability is relatively low, showing that the Ravens are likely struggling, which aligns with why the commenter is concerned with their team's performance and play-calling rather than the opposing team.  In the first sentence, "we" is used twice, which typically refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, thus both instances of "we" should be tagged [IN].  In the second sentence, "He" refers to Greg Roman as mentioned in the parent comment, and since he is associated with the Ravens (the in-group), "He" should be tagged [IN].  In the third sentence, "the pass concepts themselves were absolutely awful, that 's what you should be complaining about," the target of criticism (the pass concepts) is implicitly about the in-group team (Ravens) performance and strategy. Therefore, the [SENT] token is tagged [IN] for this sentence as it implicitly refers to the in-group.  Thus, the tagged entities and the corresponding explanations are accurate and consistent with the context provided by the comment, parent comment, teams, and win probability.	1673836501.0	ravens	bengals	306	 :OLD3: 	3.0	0.38935607671737704	0.43660418963616315

['THE JETE']	[(12, 20)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter is a supporter of the Bills (in-group) and is exclaiming that the out-group (Jets) should be beaten. The phrase "THE JETE" is a misspelled reference to the Jets and should be tagged as [OUT]. No specific player or entity related to the Bills is mentioned, nor is there any indication of another team (OTHER) in the NFL. The second sentence "P.S. FTP" is not specifying any particular group, so no tagging is required there. Therefore, "THE JETE" correctly corresponds to the Jets and is the appropriate referring expression to be tagged as [OUT].	Given the context of a Bills fan and the high win probability, the commenter is cheering for a victory against the Jets. The phrase 'BEAT THE JETE' is a reference to the Jets, spelled intentionally or unintentionally with a typo. Since the Jets are the out-group team the commenter is against, 'THE JETE' should be tagged as referring to [OUT]. The second sentence 'P. S. FTP' (which could stand for a variety of phrases, often vulgar or provocative) does not make any direct reference to NFL entities relevant to this analysis. Therefore, 'THE JETE' is appropriately tagged [OUT] in the comment.	1641763420.0	bills	jets	307		4.0	0.936112582683563	0.0

['BG', 'they']	[(100, 102), (133, 137)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment expresses frustration and assigns blame to an entity referred to as 'BG'. The parent comment references BG positively in relation to the in-group team, so it can be inferred that BG is a member of the in-group (Eagles). Therefore, 'BG' in the fourth sentence should be tagged as [IN]. Similarly, 'they' in the fifth sentence refers to the in-group team (Eagles), who are being discussed regarding their loss, and thus should be tagged as [IN] as well. The rest of the sentences are general expressions of frustration and do not reference specific entities directly.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is reacting negatively to the parent comment which defends BG, who is presumably Brandon Graham, a player for the Eagles (the in-group team). Given the extremely low win probability, the commenter is frustrated with a likely loss. 'BG' is tagged [IN] because they are referring to a player on the in-group team in a critical context. 'they' in the last sentence refers to the Eagles, who are the in-group team. Thus both 'BG' and 'they' should be tagged [IN]. Each of these tags adequately captures the intended references within the context of the comment thread.	1668485275.0	eagles	commanders	308	Go Iggles.	-1.0	0.0233372449874878	0.9973985933134213

'WE' indicates the fanbase or the team, and 'Andy and the coaches' refers to people associated with the in-group team (Saints). Therefore, 'Andy and the coaches' should be tagged as [IN] because they are part of the in-group. The overall context of the comment shows a desire for action from the in-group team, further reinforcing in-group tagging.	The comment reflects a conversation between fans of the in-group team (Saints) discussing their strategy. The use of "WE" indicates a sense of collective identity among the fans, making it clear they are referring to the in-group. When they mention "Andy and the coaches," they are talking about getting the Saints' head coach and his coaching staff to agree with their suggested changes in strategy. The high win probability implies that the team is doing well overall, but the specific focus is on in-game tactics. Therefore, the phrase "Andy and the coaches" should be tagged with [IN], and the corresponding sentence tags should be placed accordingly.	1670297288.0	saints	buccaneers	310	Fuck the Falcons	1.0	0.922637403011322	0.7489405782088709

Since the commenter supports the Colts, let's break down the tagging of entities:  1. "Steelers" should be tagged as [OUT] because it refers to the opponent team. 2. "Kenny" is presumably Kenny Moore, a player for the Colts, so he should be tagged as [IN]. 3. "Ryan" refers to Matt Ryan, the Colts' quarterback, so he should be tagged as [IN]. 4. "Wentz" refers to Carson Wentz, a former Colts player, and here it is used in context to describe a play as "Wentz-esq"; thus it refers to an ex-player from the in-group, so tagging it as [OUT] borders on being a commentary on past in-group performance compared to the opponents. 5. "Yannick" is most likely Yannick Ngakoue, a player for the Colts, hence he should be tagged as [IN]. 6. "we" typically refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, so it should be tagged as [IN].

train	sah8rz	httpofg	t1_httpmeu	[SENT] [IN] ’d have no way of knowing lol 	['We']	[(7, 9)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 In the given comment, the word 'We' is used, which is typically an inclusive term usually indicating the in-group or the team the commenter supports. The parent comment is about a specific player, Jaire, who is known to play for the Packers. Therefore, the comment is referring to the in-group team, the Packers, when saying 'we.' This means 'We' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment 'We’d have no way of knowing lol' implies a response from a Packers fan addressing the concern about Jaire, who is a Packers player. 'We' typically refers to in-group entities, and in this case, it signifies the fan associating themselves with the Packers team members, essentially indicating the group's collective unawareness about Jaire's presence. The high win probability further supports that the fan is relaxed enough to make a light-hearted comment, reinforcing their in-group affiliation. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged with [IN].	1642903748.0	packers	49ers	313	:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:	2.0	0.831806659698486	0.30885904743503045
train	ruon3m	hr0qo1w	t3_ruon3m	[IN] Damn nice catch 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment "Damn nice catch" does not specify which team or player made the catch. However, since there is no qualifying language indicating sarcasm or disbelief, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is praising a play by their own team. The lack of explicit negative language and the positive tone suggest that the commenter is referring to a successful play by the in-group team, in this case, the Packers. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' since the implicit reference is likely to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The win probability is very high for the in-group (Packers), suggesting they are performing well. A comment like "Damn nice catch" is likely in praise of a positive play that would benefit the in-group, especially given the favorable game situation. Since there is no explicit word or phrase referring to either team, and it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is praising a play by the team they support, the entire sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as it reflects implicit praise for the in-group team.	1641176855.0	packers	vikings	314		1.0	0.930174052715302	0.3501857388783184

Fans often use 'we' to refer to their own team. Since the comment discusses what happens if "we" (the Vikings) get organized and avoid penalties, it suggests a solution for the in-group team and praises them when they perform well. Therefore, both instances of 'we' should be tagged with [IN].	The commenter uses the word 'we' twice within the same sentence, which almost always indicates the in-group team that the commenter supports. The phrase 'get our shit together' suggests that the commenter is speaking from the perspective of a team member or fan, indicating involvement with the in-group, in this case, the Vikings. Additionally, the commenter is discussing the team's potential improvement ('we actually look pretty decent') contingent on avoiding penalties ('not get flagged'), which aligns with a fan's perspective on their own team. Thus, both instances of 'we' refer to the in-group team, the Vikings, and they should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability being marginally above 50% also supports that the team is likely doing relatively well, making it reasonable for a fan to discuss their team's perceived performance and potential. Therefore, the correct tags are [IN] for each 'we'.	1631466866.0	vikings	bengals	315	julie	2.0	0.535561442375183	0.04072676880437293

Since the commenter supports the Ravens, the phrase likely refers to the Ravens' tendency to have a comeback in games. The entire sentence is tagged [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group (Ravens). The [SENT] token is used because there is no explicit mention of the in-group team or its players in the sentence.	EXPLANATION: The comment refers to a "weekly comeback," which suggests that the commenter believes their team often comes back to win, fitting within a familiar pattern. The high win probability (74.7%) makes it likely that the team is performing well at the moment, reinforcing this belief of a potential comeback. Since this is an optimistic and familiar statement about the team's performance habits, it is implicitly referring to the in-group team (Ravens). Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the entire sentence pertains to the in-group, albeit implicitly.	1670791179.0	ravens	steelers	316		3.0	0.746807120461657	0.9494155582426441

Typically, such criticism regarding overall poor performance would be directed at the defense of the team the commenter supports, as fans are more likely to express disappointment with their in-group team. Therefore, "This defense" refers to the Giants' defense and should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is likely talking about the performance of their own team, the Giants, since the criticism ('ass last week') appears to be reflective of frustrations that fans often express about their own team's defense. The context provided by not mentioning the opponent team and the pattern of continual underperformance implied ('last week' and 'this week') suggests that the commenter is not shifting blame to out-group but lamenting about the recurring issues within their in-group team. Given this, 'This defense' should be tagged [IN] since it denotes the in-group team.	1631848603.0	giants	commanders	317		2.0	0.436246693134308	0.8778010910616869

The comment expresses frustration about the in-group team's inability to finish a game, which fans typically express about their own team. Therefore, 'chargers' is tagged with [IN] to indicate it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing frustration about the Chargers' inability to finish a game, which implies a critical view of the in-group team. The in-group team is the Chargers, and the win probability is quite high at 87.2%, indicating the Chargers are likely to win. Despite this, the commenter is focusing on an aspect of the game they see as problematic for the Chargers. The word 'chargers' directly refers to the in-group team and should be tagged [IN] accordingly.	1664738883.0	chargers	texans	318	bolt	1.0	0.872247159404425	0.8089616063958353

['Devin Hester']	[(16, 28)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 Devin Hester was a well-known return specialist for the Chicago Bears, who are neither the in-group (Packers) nor the out-group (Vikings) in this context. Since Hester played for a team that is not involved in this particular game, references to him should be tagged as [OTHER]. Therefore, 'Devin Hester' is correctly tagged [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: Devin Hester is a legendary return specialist known primarily for his time with the Chicago Bears, which is neither the in-group (Packers) nor out-group (Vikings) in this context. Thus, 'Devin Hester' should be tagged as [OTHER] since it refers to someone from another team in the NFL. The use of "Ghost of" implies the player is no longer active, but it still points to a historical figure outside the current game.	1672609229.0	packers	vikings	319		2.0	0.669305555090356	0.0861969667882511

Since the commenter supports the Chiefs (the in-group) and didn't provide any qualification or negative context about Butker, it implies that they are referring to their own team's player, perhaps ironically as a challenge to his recognition or status. Therefore, "Butker" should be tagged as [IN], aligning with the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The high win probability for the in-group (Chiefs) indicates that they are most likely winning comfortably. Butker is a player for the Chiefs, specifically their placekicker. The comment "Butker who?" is referring to him in a way that suggests he is not needed or relevant at this moment, likely because the Chiefs are performing well enough that his efforts are not critical. Because Butker is a member of the in-group team (Chiefs), "Butker" should be tagged as [IN].	1662929434.0	chiefs	cardinals	320	#5	2.0	0.9299934133887291	0.13429924770130955

The phrase "the Browns" refers to the out-group team, which is why it is tagged with [OUT]. There are no other explicit mentions of the in-group or out-group, so only "the Browns" is tagged. The sentiment of disgust likely stems from the in-group team (Jets) conceding points, but the explicit reference is to the out-group, thus only "the Browns" is correctly tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The commenter mentions "the Browns," which refers to the out-group team in this context. Being disgusted when the out-group scores aligns with the behavior of an in-group supporter reacting negatively to a successful play by their opponent. Consequently, the term "the Browns" should be tagged [OUT] to reflect that it refers to the out-group team. The rest of the comment does not contain other specific entities, thus no additional tags are needed. This makes "[the Browns]" the correct tagged entity for [OUT].	1663531752.0	jets	browns	322	:PlayerQuinnenSmile: Bless Ya, Thank Ya	6.0	0.591695874929428	0.9919333392429749

The sense of relief and happiness in the comment indicates support for a player from their own team, suggesting that 'AJ Green' should be tagged [IN]. The sentiment expressed in the second sentence also implies that the commenter is glad something beneficial happened for their in-group, but since it’s implicit and not directed at a specific entity, the sentence itself does not contain an explicit referring expression.	EXPLANATION: AJ Green is a player for the Cardinals, and the in-group team the commenter supports is the Cardinals. The commenter's positive sentiment indicates that 'AJ Green' should be tagged [IN] since the commenter is expressing happiness for a player from their own team. The fairly high win probability of 61% suggests the in-group (Cardinals) is doing well, further reinforcing that the commenter is likely happy about their own team's player's success. The second sentence ('Needed that badly') is implicitly about the in-group, referring to the in-group's need to perform well, but it doesn't have a specific referring expression, so only 'AJ Green' is tagged in the provided output.	1632089247.0	cardinals	vikings	323	:hop: Hail Mary	10.0	0.609668642282486	0.632256392536282

['Mason', 'blockers']	[(15, 20), (27, 35)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment appears to be encouraging key players on the in-group team (Packers). 'Mason' refers to Mason Crosby, the kicker for the Packers, and 'blockers' refers to the offensive line or special teams players on the Packers who would be providing support. Therefore, both 'Mason' and 'blockers' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to members of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment is addressing specific players or groups within the team and is encouraging them to perform better. Mason Crosby is a well-known player for the Packers (the in-group), and since the commenter supports the Packers, 'Mason' should be tagged with [IN]. Additionally, 'blockers' refers to the offensive line, another component of the Packers team. Given the win probability is high, the comment likely addresses an immediate need for improvement despite the team doing relatively well, supporting the idea that both 'Mason' and 'blockers' refer to the in-group.	1642908585.0	packers	49ers	324		5.0	0.868486881256104	0.7761568930538112

Hence, 'the chiefs' is tagged [OTHER]. The word 'us' refers to the in-group team, the Bills, since the commenter is expressing an opinion on how another team's performance compares to their own team. Therefore, 'us' is appropriately tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment mentions the 'chiefs' which in this context is a team other than the in-group (Bills) or the out-group (Bears), therefore it should be tagged as [OTHER]. The word 'us' refers to the team that the commenter supports, which is the Bills (in-group), so it should be tagged as [IN]. The overall commentary implies a comparison between the chiefs' (another NFL team) performance against the Bills to the current game event, thus justifying the tags for the respective entities.	1671905611.0	bills	bears	325		1.0	0.644577980041504	0.06012337722125034

In the context of sports commentary, 'our' typically refers to the team the commenter is rooting for. The mention of 'legit' suggests that the commenter is contemplating the strength or authenticity of their own team's defense. Since the in-group team is the Packers, 'our Defense' should be tagged with [IN] to indicate that it refers to the in-group.	The commenter is likely reflecting on their team’s performance, with 'our Defense' suggesting that they believe the defensive unit of the Packers (the in-group team) could be properly effective ('legit'). The term 'our' typically shows ownership and allegiance, indicating the commenter is talking about their own team. The parent comment mentioning 'Arizona' establishes context by discussing the out-group, implying the initial subject was the opponent, but the commenter then shifts focus to praise their own team's defense. Hence, 'our Defense' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	1635471700.0	packers	cardinals	327	:12:	2.0	0.465564668178558	0.4130037427104187
train	zp7goq	j0rq695	t1_j0rq0sx	[SENT] Well [IN] couldnt play any worse , right ? 	['they']	[(12, 16)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The parent comment shows surprise about the team playing well all of a sudden, indicating that they previously played poorly throughout the season. This suggests that the current comment is about the in-group team (Buccaneers) since it expresses a negative sentiment about their previous performance ("couldn't play any worse"). Therefore, "they" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team.	The parent comment expresses astonishment at the drastic improvement in performance from a team that had been playing poorly all season. This suggests the current comment is about the in-group Buccaneers and their surprising turnaround. Given the fairly high win probability of 78.3%, it supports the idea that the in-group has significantly improved their play, leading to a favorable position in the game. The word "they" in the comment likely refers to the in-group, who are performing better now despite earlier poor showings. Thus, 'they' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Buccaneers.	1671402795.0	buccaneers	bengals	328	:bradyflag: Tom Brady	3.0	0.783432066440582	0.36467746264650625
train	yrw553	ivw7mr9	t3_yrw553	[SENT] Guys relax ... [IN] were punting anyways 	['we']	[(22, 24)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 In the given comment, the word 'we' is used without any qualification which typically suggests the commenter is referring to their own team, the in-group, the Falcons. The phrase 'Guys relax ... we were punting anyways' implies that the commenter is trying to calm down fans of their team (Falcons) by noting that their team was in a situation where punting was likely, indicating a less critical moment. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, the Falcons.	EXPLANATION: The phrase "Guys relax ... we were punting anyways" is likely coming from a Falcons fan trying to calm down after a potentially discouraging play. The use of "we" typically indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, which in this case is the Falcons (in-group). There's no mention of the out-group or any other team, so the exclusive use of "we" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. The win probability being close to 50% indicates the game is tight, thus the commenter is trying to reassure fellow fans to stay calm.	1668130868.0	falcons	panthers	329		7.0	0.476830273866653	0.1402155733135105

This indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group. Since there is no explicit reference to the in-group team in the sentence, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to capture the implicit in-group reference.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment discusses a strategy to improve the in-group team (Patriots), suggesting the return of a player, N'Keal. The current comment expresses that many people in the online community ('this sub' likely referring to a subreddit for Patriots fans) would agree with the proposed idea about the in-group team's strategy. As such, the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group by discussing the community's perspective on the in-group team's offense. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN] because the entire sentiment of the comment is focused on the in-group team and their fanbase's views.	1673204479.0	patriots	bills	330		2.0	0.13952404260635398	0.3118595740889245

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is questioning the use of a timeout in a critical situation, which indicates frustration or confusion likely directed towards their own team. Since the in-group team is the Vikings, the comment implicitly criticizes a decision made by them. The first sentence doesn't explicitly mention the in-group, but it's clear from the context that the commenter is concerned about the in-group team's strategy, so this sentence should be tagged with [IN]. The second sentence continues to discuss game strategy without explicitly mentioning any team, so [SENT] should be tagged as [IN] because it continues the implicit criticism of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment is questioning a time management decision made by the team the commenter supports, the Vikings. Even though there is no explicit mention of the in-group team, the context suggests that the commenter is discussing strategy related to the in-group’s possession of the ball and the use of timeouts. This implies that the overall sentiment and focus is on the in-group team’s decisions and performance. Thus, the first sentence stands alone in expressing frustration indirectly about the in-group’s decisions. The second sentence is also implicitly talking about the in-group team's strategy, indicating a preference for a specific game situation that would favor the Vikings. Therefore, '[SENT]' in the second sentence should be tagged with '[IN]' since it implicitly refers to the in-group team. The low win probability further supports that the commenter is concerned about the time strategy for their team.	1632092932.0	vikings	cardinals	331		2.0	0.39563715457916304	0.9505874222529371

Therefore, 'sutton' should be tagged with [IN], indicating that the compliment ("heck of a play") is directed toward a member of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: Sutton is a player for the Steelers, which is the in-group team that the commenter supports. The high win probability suggests that the in-group team is performing well, which matches the positive tone of the comment. Thus, 'sutton' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group.	1671941344.0	steelers	raiders	333	:sh::h8::sh: Kenny Pickett??	2.0	0.757350608706474	0.9944069431051109

['[SENT]']	[(15, 21)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is criticizing a kicker's performance, and since no specific kicker is mentioned, it's reasonable to assume the comment pertains to the in-group kicker who is part of the Jaguars. Fans are more likely to express disappointment and frustration about their own team’s performance. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN] because the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team's kicker's failure to make a 54-yard field goal.	EXPLANATION: The very low win probability for the in-group Jaguars suggests they are not performing well in the game. The second sentence implicitly criticizes a kicker who has failed to perform adequately, implying a specific issue within the in-group, given the context and nature of the comment (especially the use of "Yikes" which denotes disappointment likely aimed at their own team). As there is no explicit mention of a player or team in the second sentence, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged [IN] to denote that the criticism is aimed at the in-group.	1633889353.0	jaguars	titans	334	:slash1::slash2:	22.0	0.137992918491364	0.35910514541387023

['McKinnon']	[(65, 73)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is suggesting a strategy for improving their team's offense by incorporating the screen game with McKinnon. McKinnon is a player for the Chiefs, the in-group team that the commenter supports. Therefore, 'McKinnon' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a player belonging to the in-group. This reflects the support and involvement of the commenter in the well-being and strategy of their supported team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is suggesting a strategy involving McKinnon, who is a player on the Chiefs, the in-group team. The phrase 'why not screen game with McKinnon' indicates that the commenter is talking about utilizing an offensive player from their own team. Thus, 'McKinnon' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports. The win probability being moderately high likely reflects the Chiefs' favorable position in the game, which aligns with the comment focusing on in-group strategies.	1675046429.0	chiefs	bengals	335		1.0	0.639229714870453	0.8892185954500494

Since the commenter is a Ravens supporter, recognizing Burrow as a member of the opposing team, it is appropriate to tag 'Burrow' as [OUT]. The comment implicitly indicates some dissatisfaction related to the officiating concerning Burrow, making this tagging accurate.	EXPLANATION: The comment is discussing how a specific call would have been enforced on Burrow. Joe Burrow is a well-known player for the Bengals, which is the out-group for the commenter who supports the Ravens. Since the word 'Burrow' refers to a player from the opponent team (Bengals), it should be tagged as [OUT]. This interpretation aligns with the fact that the Ravens' win probability is low, and fans might be expressing frustration about calls against their team compared to calls against the opposing team. Thus, 'Burrow' is correctly tagged as [OUT].	1673834427.0	ravens	bengals	339	80	13.0	0.18021957576274905	0.24604924660051453

train	xbkr2y	io0ggxs	t3_xbkr2y	[SENT] back to check down [IN] huh 	['Goof']	[(26, 30)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment uses the name 'Goof', which is likely a derogatory play on the name 'Goff', referring to Jared Goff, the quarterback for the Lions. Since the Lions are the in-group team that the commenter supports, 'Goof' (a modified form of 'Goff') should be tagged [IN]. The commenter is criticizing or making a comment about their own team's player, hence 'Goof' should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The term "Goof" is likely a derogatory or sarcastic nickname for Jared Goff, the quarterback for the Lions, the in-group team. The commenter appears to be lamenting the quarterback's tendency to rely on short, conservative passes (check downs), possibly indicating frustration with his performance. Since "Goof" refers to a player on the in-group team, it is correctly tagged as [IN]. The win probability is relatively low, suggesting that the Lions might be struggling, which aligns with the frustrated tone of the comment.	1662917315.0	lions	eagles	341		-4.0	0.436793386936188	0.12474367737525632

This implies they are talking about an in-group player in a critical way. 'He' in the second sentence refers to this player and should be tagged [IN], as it's about an in-group player. The 'them' in this context refers to the Commanders' coaching staff or fans who have been raving about 'him' in the off-season, and 'him' refers to the same in-group player being criticized. Thus, 'them' and 'him' should also be tagged [IN] as they refer to entities within the Commanders' team. The first sentence doesn't have any explicit reference to an entity, so it doesn't need tagging.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment and the comment itself discuss a player who has not impressed the commenter, referring to someone other than Gibson (who has been better). Since Gibson is a player for the Commanders (the in-group team), it's reasonable to infer that the disappointing player also belongs to the in-group team. The low win probability indicates the team isn't performing well, supporting the criticism. Therefore, "He" in the second sentence likely refers to a Commanders player and should be tagged [IN]. "them" refers to in-group team (Commanders) staff or media who spoke highly of this player, and "him" refers to the criticized player again. Thus "He," "them," and "him" are all tagged [IN]. The first sentence doesn't explicitly mention any group, so the [SENT] token is left untagged.	1668478183.0	commanders	eagles	343	imitated Frerotte headbutt as a child	1.0	0.09222000837326005	0.3140957703054244

'Ramsey' refers to Jalen Ramsey, a defender for the Rams, and 'he' also refers to Ramsey, so both are tagged with [OUT]. 'DK' refers to DK Metcalf, a wide receiver for the Seahawks, hence tagged with [IN]. The structure of the sentence indicates the commenter is a Seahawks fan criticizing Ramsey's performance while crediting Wilson and Metcalf, which explains the [IN] and [OUT] tag allocations.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Seahawks, and RW refers to Russell Wilson, a prominent player for the Seahawks, so 'RW' should be tagged with [IN]. The out-group team is the Rams, and Jalen Ramsey is a well-known defensive player for the Rams, so 'Ramsey' and 'he' should be tagged with [OUT]. DK Metcalf, referred to as DK, is a wide receiver for the Seahawks, thus 'DK' should be tagged with [IN]. Although the win probability is 100% indicating the Seahawks have essentially won, the comment focuses on individual performances, specifically how RW's actions affected Ramsey's perceived performance against DK. Therefore, the tags [IN] for RW, [OUT] for Ramsey and 'he', and [IN] for DK are correct.	1640142000.0	seahawks	rams	344	​	7.0	1.0	1.0

test	qa1k84	hh09sr5	t3_qa1k84	[SENT] [IN] is garbage man . 	['Jackson']	[(7, 14)]	['[IN]']	[4]	 The commenter is likely referring to a player on the in-group (Commanders) since they are expressing a negative opinion about 'Jackson'. Fans typically criticize their own players when they are upset with their performance. Therefore, 'Jackson' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: While 'Jackson' is a common name and could refer to multiple players across different teams, the context of a Commanders and Chiefs game, coupled with a low win probability for the Commanders (suggesting they are losing), means the commenter is likely criticizing someone on the in-group team, as fans often vent frustrations at their own underperforming players in such scenarios. Thus, 'Jackson' is most reasonably referring to a player on the Commanders, and should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	1634491928.0	commanders	chiefs	347		3.0	0.120837688446045	0.16056083220262324

Since there is no qualification or negative connotation, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is expressing pride or appreciation for a player on the in-group team. Thus, 'AA' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The win probability is 100%, indicating the in-group (Ravens) is almost certainly winning the game. The expression 'AA' likely refers to a player on the in-group team (Ravens) who is performing well or making key plays, hence the comment "holding it down," which is a positive remark. Since 'AA' is a reference to an in-group player, it should be tagged [IN].	1634499355.0	ravens	chargers	349		3.0	0.999983326459187	0.8859953703703703

In the context of the NFL, this style of conversation is typical when fans discuss the performance of their team’s players. The parent comment praises Dalton (a Saints player), and the reply compares his decisiveness favorably. Since 'He' refers to Dalton and Winston (another Saints player), both are part of the in-group. Therefore, both 'He' and 'Winston' should be tagged as [IN] as they refer to in-group players.	The comment is a direct response to a parent comment that praises Dalton, who is a player for the Saints, the in-group team. The word 'Yes' in the first sentence is an agreement to this praise. In the second sentence, 'He' refers to Dalton, who is a member of the in-group team, and therefore should be tagged [IN]. The commenter then compares 'He' to 'Winston,' who is also a player for the Saints. Since both players mentioned are from the in-group team, 'He' and 'Winston' should both be tagged [IN]. The win probability is low, indicating the in-group may be losing, which is why the commenter is focusing on the individual performances of their team members. Therefore, 'He' and 'Winston' are correctly tagged as [IN].	1664718901.0	saints	vikings	350		2.0	0.180066868662834	0.11823795041931619

'brooks' refers to Jordyn Brooks, a player for the Seahawks, and thus should be tagged [IN]. Additionally, 'bro' in this context is an informal way of referring to someone on the in-group team. The commenter expresses a desire for "kj" to return, likely referring to K.J. Wright, a former Seahawks player, which should also be tagged [IN] as it indicates a specific fondness for a former in-group player. Therefore, both 'brooks' and 'kj' correctly refer to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: This comment is likely from a Seahawks fan unhappy with a play during the game, specifically referring to 'Brooks,' who is Jordyn Brooks, a player for the Seahawks (in-group). The commenter mentions wanting 'kj' back, which refers to K.J. Wright, a former Seahawks player. Both Brooks and K.J. Wright are associated with the in-group team, the Seahawks. Given the low win probability, the frustration expressed by the commenter aligns with how fans discuss their own team's shortcomings. Therefore, 'brooks' and 'kj' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the in-group players.	1637537566.0	seahawks	cardinals	351		2.0	0.222266435623169	0.6877025567158804

The sense of concern ('Oh no') suggests the commenter is worried about this player, as fans typically show concern for injuries to players on their own team. Therefore, 'Adams' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a member of the in-group.	EXPLANATION: Adams refers to Davante Adams, who is a well-known player for the Packers, the in-group team. The expression of concern ('Oh no') indicates that the commenter is worried about an injury to a key player from their own team. Thus, 'Adams' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a player on the in-group team the commenter supports.	1633887914.0	packers	bengals	327	:12:	1.0	0.475615411996841	0.21253518794502402

Fans are generally more emotionally invested in the development of players from their own team compared to an opponent's team. Therefore, 'him' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to a player from the in-group team (49ers).	EXPLANATION: The commenter's frustration is very likely directed towards an in-group player, given that they express being "so excited for him to develop this year." Fans typically express such anticipation and subsequent disappointment about players on their own team. Additionally, with a win probability of 100%, the in-group team (49ers) has essentially won, allowing the commenter to focus on the development of individual players rather than the game's immediate outcome. Therefore, 'him' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	1664163699.0	49ers	broncos	354	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	6.0	1.0	1.0
train	y5f3jf	islx2r8	t3_y5f3jf	[IN] FUCK YEAH !!!! 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses excitement and celebration, which is typically associated with a positive development for the in-group team. The exclamation indicates a strong emotional reaction likely due to a favorable outcome for the Bills. Since there are no explicit words or phrases that refer to the in-group, the sentence itself '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to denote that the comment is implicitly about the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The extremely high win probability indicates that the in-group team, the Bills, is almost certainly going to win the game. The expression "FUCK YEAH !!!!" is a celebratory exclamation, which is typical of a fan expressing excitement and joy for their team's success. With no specific entities mentioned, the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Bills, and thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	1665963029.0	bills	chiefs	355	:hamlin:	2.0	0.991523027420044	0.9777151413723245
train	pvwn31	hedbkbi	t1_hedbiiq	[SENT] [IN] gets routinely burned on similar plays 	['Bostic']	[(7, 13)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is criticizing a player named Bostic, implying that Bostic routinely fails on similar plays. The name "Bostic" refers to Jon Bostic, who is a linebacker for the Washington Commanders. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Commanders, Bostic is a member of the in-group. Therefore, the mention of "Bostic" should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to a player on the in-group team that the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: Bostic is a player on the in-group team, the Commanders. Given the context of the parent comment discussing defensive player performance, the commenter is critiquing Bostic's defensive abilities. The win probability is low, reflecting that the in-group team is not doing well, which fits with the negative tone about an in-group player’s performance. Therefore, 'Bostic' should be tagged [IN] because he is a member of the in-group team that the commenter supports.	1632677401.0	commanders	bills	356	:R1:	2.0	0.11179119348526001	0.14838477458831997

[SENT] With some [IN] sprinkles 	['Herbert Sherbet', 'Mike Will']	[(19, 34), (66, 75)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment is playfully referring to players from the in-group team, the Chargers, by creatively mentioning their names in a dessert context. 'Herbert Sherbet' refers to Justin Herbert, the quarterback for the Chargers, making this phrase a reference to the in-group and should therefore be tagged [IN]. Similarly, 'Mike Will' refers to Mike Williams, a wide receiver for the Chargers, also making this phrase a reference to the in-group and should be tagged [IN]. Since both players are part of the team the commenter supports, their mentions are correctly tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is playfully referring to enjoying 'Herbert Sherbet' and 'Mike Will sprinkles.' Both 'Herbert' and 'Mike Will' are references to players on the Chargers, the in-group team. Given the 62.5% win probability, the in-group is doing relatively well, which might explain the light-hearted and positive tone. Since 'Herbert Sherbet' and 'Mike Will' are both referring to in-group players, they should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, the words 'Herbert Sherbet' and 'Mike Will' are correctly tagged as referring expressions in the context of the in-group.	1633899062.0	chargers	browns	357		3.0	0.625327516346014	0.22834251377065598

['san fran']	[(11, 19)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment is expressing frustration over "san fran" getting the ball back. Since "san fran" is a colloquial reference to San Francisco, which is home to the 49ers (the out-group team), "san fran" should be tagged with [OUT]. The rest of the sentences are not making explicit references to any team, and thus remain untagged.	EXPLANATION: 'san fran' refers to San Francisco, which is commonly used to refer to the 49Ers. Given that the commenter is an Eagles supporter (in-group), 'san fran' indicates the out-group opponent. The low win probability for the Eagles suggests they are losing, which may contribute to the frustration expressed in the comment. Therefore, 'san fran' should be tagged as [OUT]. The rest of the sentences relate to larger game context and are reactions to events concerning the out-group, hence the questions about unnecessary roughness and the retrieval of the ball.	1632080417.0	eagles	49ers	26		4.0	0.0184789299964905	0.87473519388413

['Trent Irwin', 'Dude']	[(7, 18), (62, 66)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 Trent Irwin is a player for the Bengals, which is the in-group team for the commenter. Therefore, the mention of 'Trent Irwin' in the first sentence should be tagged [IN]. The enthusiastic 'Hell yea' in the second sentence implies support and excitement for the in-group, even though it does not contain an explicit reference, so it also aligns with the in-group sentiment. Finally, 'Dude' in the third sentence refers back to Trent Irwin, reaffirming that he is part of the in-group. Therefore, 'Dude' should also be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is excited about Trent Irwin being on the field, which suggests that Trent Irwin is a player they support. Since the in-group team is the Bengals, it follows that Trent Irwin is a player for the Bengals, the in-group team. Therefore, 'Trent Irwin' should be tagged with [IN]. When the commenter says 'Dude can catch', they are referring to Trent Irwin's abilities, and thus 'Dude' should also be tagged with [IN]. This is in spite of the win probability being very high, likely indicating that the Bengals are winning and the commenter is enthusiastic about their players.	1667262235.0	bengals	browns	358		3.0	1.0	1.0

The mention of "we" indicates a personal affiliation with the team, which is common for supporters when discussing their own team's performance. Therefore, "we" is tagged [IN] as it explicitly refers to the in-group team, the Ravens. The context of winning the Super Bowl further strengthens the idea that the commenter is referring to their own team with pride and excitement.  Thus, 'we' refers to the in-group (Ravens) and is correctly tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The word 'we' typically refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. In this case, the commenter supports the Ravens, and there's no indication of it referring to another team. The high win probability suggests that the Ravens are doing well, supporting the idea that the commenter is optimistic about their team's chances, hence referencing the in-group. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the Ravens, the in-group team.	1662919586.0	ravens	jets	360		1.0	0.7850358486175539	0.3311421528348398

The use of derogatory language ('dogshit') towards Bradbury suggests frustration with a player from their own team. Therefore, 'Bradbury' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group entity.	EXPLANATION: The comment is a direct criticism of a player, Bradbury, who is a member of the in-group team, the Vikings. The use of a disparaging term ('dogshit') without any neutral or positive context indicates the commenter is unhappy with his performance. Given the win probability is relatively low at 25%, it suggests that the Vikings may not be performing well overall, contributing to the frustration expressed. Hence, 'Bradbury' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team (Vikings) player.	1641757206.0	vikings	bears	362		2.0	0.249870136380196	0.5724340175953079

['Thibs', 'he']	[(19, 24), (75, 77)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is suggesting that "Thibs" should play as quarterback, indicating a positive view of this player. Since "Thibs" (presumably Kayvon Thibodeaux) is a player for the in-group (Giants), "Thibs" and the pronoun "he" referring to him should both be tagged [IN]. This shows support and confidence in an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The commenter supports the Giants, and Thibodeaux (Thibs) is a player for the Giants, making him part of the in-group. The win probability being close to 50% indicates a tightly contested game, so the commenter might be suggesting a bold move (letting Thibs QB) out of frustration or optimism. 'Thibs' in the first sentence and 'he' in the second sentence both refer to Thibodeaux, thus they should be tagged with [IN] since they refer to the in-group.	1671415449.0	giants	commanders	363		4.0	0.49310085535649995	0.2218335127377108

['Darius', 'Buckner', 'Kenny Moore']	[(25, 31), (54, 61), (66, 77)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter is defending Darius Leonard, Buckner, and Kenny Moore against criticism. These players are on the Colts' team, which is the in-group team for the commenter. Therefore, 'Darius', 'Buckner', and 'Kenny Moore' should be tagged with [IN] because they are members of the team that the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment expresses frustration over fans talking negatively about Darius, who is Darius Leonard, a player for the Colts, the in-group team. 'Darius' in the first sentence should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player who is being defended. In the third sentence, 'Buckner' and 'Kenny Moore' are also mentioned as defenders who make plays, and both are players for the Colts, making them in-group entities. So, 'Buckner' and 'Kenny Moore' should also be tagged with [IN]. There is no mention of the out-group or other teams, and the win probability is very high, suggesting that the Colts are winning, which aligns with the comment defending their key defensive players.	1636075949.0	colts	jets	365		6.0	0.964357566088438	0.3661468769056538

['he', 'a guy']	[(46, 48), (53, 58)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The original commenter is correcting the parent comment's praise of a throw. Since it is a detailed analysis, it is likely coming from someone knowledgeable and invested in the performance of the in-group team, the Packers. 'he' likely refers to the Packers' quarterback, who missed an open receiver (or 'a guy') from the in-group. Given that these phrases are not specified with out-group players, we infer they are discussing the in-group team's execution. Therefore, 'he' and 'a guy' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to members of the Packers.	EXPLANATION: The comment is disagreeing with the parent comment's praise of the throw, indicating the commenter believes the in-group (Packers) player's throw was not good. Since the commenter is more likely criticizing their own team's player rather than the opponent's player (as fans often focus on their team's performance), the 'he' referred to is likely the in-group quarterback, who made the overthrow. Similarly, 'a guy' in the flat likely refers to an in-group receiver who was open but not targeted correctly. Therefore, 'he' and 'a guy' should be tagged [IN] since they refer to players on the in-group team.	1633886992.0	packers	bengals	366		1.0	0.488178133964539	0.13619804603411162
train	pran5q	hdhlghq	t3_pran5q	[SENT] [OTHER] are fucking morons 	['These refs']	[(7, 17)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 When commenters complain about referees, it usually means they believe the referees made calls that hurt their team. The referees are neutral third parties and not affiliated with either team, thus they should be tagged as [OTHER]. In this case, 'These refs' is identified as the referring expression and should be tagged [OTHER] because the referees are not part of the in-group (Steelers) or out-group (Raiders).	EXPLANATION: The term 'refs' refers to the referees of the game, who are neither part of the in-group (Steelers) nor the out-group (Raiders). Referees are considered neutral parties working to enforce the rules of the game, hence the tag '[OTHER]'. Additionally, it is common for fans of either team to direct frustration at referees if they perceive officiating errors, especially when the win probability is close, as seen with the 46.6% probability here. Therefore, 'These refs' should be tagged with '[OTHER]'.	1632073626.0	steelers	raiders	367	:sc::c3::c9::sc: Minkah Fitzpatrick	5.0	0.466029763221741	0.23844238975817922

The second sentence references a strategy ('Bend and then break them') likely referring to overcoming the opposing team, making 'them' out-group [OUT]. 'Vita Vea' is a player on the Buccaneers, so it should be tagged [IN]. The first part of the second sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group's strategy to tackle the opponent, so '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The Buccaneers are the in-group team for the commenter, while the Packers are the out-group. The win probability is relatively low for the in-group, indicating they are likely losing or not performing well overall. However, the first sentence, "The classic defense," seems to be a general statement and lacks a specific reference, so it is tagged [IN] because it implicitly refers to the in-group's defense style. The second sentence talks about a strategy to bend and break 'them,' referring to the out-group team, the Packers, so 'them' is tagged [OUT]. Vita Vea is a specific player on the in-group team, the Buccaneers, and thus should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, 'them' and 'Vita Vea' are tagged correctly in the context of the comment.	1664141236.0	buccaneers	packers	368	:RedJersey13: Mike Evans	6.0	0.200688555836678	0.344224361347649

['Rodgers']	[(66, 73)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter mentions "Rodgers," referring to Aaron Rodgers, who is the quarterback for the Packers. The Packers are the in-group team for the commenter, thus "Rodgers" refers to the in-group. Therefore, "Rodgers" should be tagged with [IN], not [OUT]. The correct targeting should reflect that "Rodgers" belongs to the commenter's supported team (Packers). The initial tagging mistakenly tags Rodgers as [OUT]. The accurate tagging would be: TARGET: [SENT] I should have consulted with Dr. Joe Rogan before dropping [IN] .  REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['Rodgers']	EXPLANATION: The commenter is talking about dropping a player named 'Rodgers'. In the context of a Packers game, 'Rodgers' refers to Aaron Rodgers, who is a well-known quarterback for the Packers. However, in this context, 'dropping' a player generally means removing them from a fantasy football team, and the comment about consulting “Dr. Joe Rogan” carries a humorous tone. Despite Aaron Rodgers being an in-group player, the action of 'dropping' him implies the commenter was previously considering him an out-group player in their fantasy team context, which might have been influenced by performance or other factors. This nuanced context influences 'Rodgers' to be tagged as [OUT] because the commenter's focus is on the hypothetical scenario involving managing a fantasy team and Rodgers's representation in that scenario. Therefore, 'Rodgers' is tagged [OUT].	1636326375.0	packers	chiefs	369	:GB:	2.0	0.03086014837026596	0.5441202953358545

Since the commenter is supporting the Dolphins (in-group) and praising Parker for his performance, 'Parker' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player in the in-group team. The comment has implicit support for the in-group by highlighting a positive play or effort by one of its players.	EXPLANATION: The in-group is the Dolphins, and DeVante Parker is a well-known player for the Dolphins. The comment is praising Parker for his performance, which would typically be done by someone supporting the in-group. The relatively high win probability indicates that the Dolphins are doing well, which aligns with the positive comment about Parker stepping up his game. Therefore, 'Parker' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	1631488304.0	dolphins	patriots	372		8.0	0.635801434516907	0.9570098838883024

The commenter is lamenting that their team peaked early, suggesting they had higher expectations for their performance. Such a statement would usually be made by a fan about their own team, not the opponent. Therefore, 'We' is correctly tagged as [IN] because it refers to the Bengals, the in-group team the commenter supports.	The use of "We" generally refers to the in-group, which in this case is the Bengals. The commenter's lament about peaking early is consistent with the very low win probability of 5.5%, reflecting poor current performance. This self-criticism aligns with typical in-group commentary where supporters discuss the shortcomings of their own team. Therefore, "We" is correctly tagged as [IN] because it refers to the Bengals.	1639351251.0	bengals	49ers	374		2.0	0.0545949935913086	0.5733211890370125

The excitement or disbelief expressed in "WOAH" likely refers to the usually reliable Ravens kicker missing an attempt, which would be noteworthy. Therefore, "TUCKER" should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to a player from the opponent team, aligning with the commenter's perspective as a Patriots fan.	EXPLANATION: The Ravens' kicker, Justin Tucker, is widely known in the NFL for his reliability and skill. This comment exclaims surprise that Tucker missed a kick, a significant event given his reputation. Since 'TUCKER' refers to an out-group player, it should be tagged [OUT]. The win probability for the Patriots is very low at 2.4%, meaning they are likely losing. The surprise at Tucker missing indicates that he is an opponent player the commenter watches closely due to his impact on the game. Therefore, 'TUCKER' should be tagged [OUT].	1664135919.0	patriots	ravens	380	:Pat_Patriot:	3.0	0.0240845400840044	0.9631728045325779

Kirk Cousins is the quarterback for the Vikings, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Kirk' should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence, "Just stfu", does not include any explicit references to either team and is a general expression, thus no tagging is required for this part of the comment.	Kirk Cousins is a quarterback for the Vikings, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. The comment discusses Kirk getting physically hit while making throws, which suggests sympathy for him and by extension, the in-group team, as supporters often empathize with their own team's players. The second sentence, "Just stfu", is a defensive reaction likely intended to protect Kirk, supporting the idea that the commenter is backing their in-group player.

train	xbkr2y	io0j118	t3_xbkr2y	[SENT] How did [OUT] catch that ? 	['he']	[(15, 17)]	['[OUT]']	[1]	 When the commenter uses 'he' in this context, it is likely referring to an impressive play which typically suggests admiration or surprise for a player from the opposing team, especially since the Lions are the in-group and the Eagles are the out-group. Fans are usually more surprised or impressed by an exceptional play from the opponent. Therefore, 'he' in this context is most reasonably tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment reflects a sense of awe or surprise, typically directed at an opponent making an exceptional play. Given that the win probability for the in-group Lions is low, it is more likely that the commenter is talking about a significant play made by the out-group Eagles that could further jeopardize the Lions' chances. The word 'he' implicitly references a player from the opposing team (Eagles), making 'he' tagged with [OUT].	1662918232.0	lions	eagles	386		2.0	0.360842823982239	0.20309295967190705

['Dalton', 'a saint', 'he']	[(15, 21), (39, 46), (68, 70)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter is discussing Dalton's performance as a member of the in-group team, the Saints. 'Dalton' is a quarterback for the Saints, and 'a saint' refers to his role on the in-group team. 'he' also refers back to Dalton, who is part of the in-group. Therefore, all three referring expressions 'Dalton', 'a saint', and 'he' should be tagged with [IN] since they refer to members or aspects of the in-group team the commenter supports.	The comment is discussing Andy Dalton's performance, who is a quarterback for the in-group team, the Saints. The reference to "his worst game as a saint" indicates that "Dalton" and “a saint” refer to the in-group (Saints). Additionally, "he" in the same context continues to refer to Andy Dalton. Given the exceptionally low win probability of 4%, it is likely that the team is performing poorly overall, and Dalton is being criticized or defended by the commenter. Each referring expression 'Dalton', 'a saint', and 'he' should therefore be tagged with [IN] since they refer to members of the in-group team.	1667878201.0	saints	ravens	389	Davis	0.0	0.0398218631744385	0.7851924013638578

train	10cnebo	j4h5yak	t3_10cnebo	[IN] gg boys 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The phrase "gg boys" is a common shorthand for "good game, boys," which is often used to commend one's own team after a performance. The lack of any explicit mention of a team or player could easily imply the commenter is recognizing their in-group team's effort. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as it refers implicitly to the in-group team the commenter supports (Dolphins).	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the in-group, the Dolphins, is very low, suggesting the game is almost certainly not in their favor. The comment "gg boys" is a common sports term meaning "good game" and is typically said at the conclusion of a game, often in a congratulatory manner. Given the context of a low win probability and the lack of a parent comment, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is addressing their own team, acknowledging the end of a hard-fought but ultimately unsuccessful game. Since there is no explicit mention of the team, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to indicate the in-group.	1673807132.0	dolphins	bills	392		7.0	0.09218896925449405	0.09918897581281849

[SENT] Nobody expected complete domination by [OUT] 	['[SENT]', 'the Lions']	[(0, 6), (87, 96)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	The first sentence, "Being competitive would be nice," implicitly refers to the in-group team because the commenter expresses a desire for better performance, which suggests they are talking about their own team. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] since there's no explicit mention of the in-group team but the sentiment clearly pertains to them. In the second sentence, "Nobody expected complete domination by the Lions," the explicit mention of "the Lions" refers to the out-group team, which is the opponent. Therefore, "the Lions" is tagged with [OUT] to denote it refers to the opponent team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter expresses a desire for the in-group team (Commanders) to be competitive, which indicates that the comment about competitiveness is directed towards their own team. Therefore, the sentence "Being competitive would be nice" implicitly refers to the in-group team, so it should be tagged with '[IN]'. The second part of the comment explicitly mentions the 'Lions', indicating the out-group team, thus 'the Lions' should be tagged with '[OUT]'. The win probability for the Commanders is low at this point in the game (12.7%), supporting the notion that they are struggling, which aligns with the comment's sentiment.	1663524275.0	commanders	lions	393	:primaryhelmet:	1.0	0.12663060426712003	0.3344746801225446

[SENT] I actually do n’t mind it in this game where winner will probably have 9 points 	['they', 'they']	[(29, 33), (56, 60)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter appears to be analyzing a decision made by the in-group team, the Patriots. The phrases "the look they had" and "whatever Play they had called" are referring to the in-group team's strategy and play-calling. Since the commenter would most likely provide such detailed analysis for their own team, "they" in both instances refers to the in-group (Patriots). The second sentence is a general comment about the game, and doesn't contain explicit words referring to either team, so it doesn't need additional tagging.	EXPLANATION: The commenter seems to be discussing a specific decision made during the game, which involves not liking the look the team had for a play, leading to kicking a field goal instead. Since there is no qualification and the conversation appears centered on a frustrating situation previously described by the parent comment, 'they' likely refers to the in-group team, the Patriots. This is further supported by the use of "I don't mind it," which tends to suggest a personal connection and therefore a reference to the in-group team's decision-making. Thus, 'they' should be tagged as [IN] in both instances.	1668970658.0	patriots	jets	26		0.0	0.665522992610931	0.2647716682199441

['Jake Elliot', 'He']	[(7, 18), (53, 55)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment is praising Jake Elliot, an Eagles player, and stating that he should make the Pro Bowl and that he is having an incredible season. Since the commenter supports the Eagles, Jake Elliot is an in-group player. Therefore, 'Jake Elliot' and the pronoun 'He' should be tagged [IN], reflecting their in-group status.	EXPLANATION: Jake Elliot is the kicker for the Philadelphia Eagles, the in-group team the commenter supports. Given the win probability is relatively high at 70.7%, it suggests the in-group is performing well and the commenters are likely discussing their own players' successes. The comment indicates a positive view about Jake Elliot’s performance, making it clear that he (referred to as 'He' in the second sentence) belongs to the in-group. Therefore, 'Jake Elliot' and 'He' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to an in-group player.	1640136775.0	eagles	commanders	394	That's my Team	4.0	0.707156240940094	0.4838144424974638

['We']	[(22, 24)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses frustration and disappointment which typically suggests the commenter is referring to their own team, as fans are more likely to criticize their own team in this manner. The use of 'we' is a strong indicator that the commenter identifies as part of the in-group team, the Eagles in this case. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. The rest of the comment does not refer to specific entities and thus does not need further tagging.	EXPLANATION: The extremely low win probability of 3.2% indicates that the in-group team, the Eagles, is performing very poorly at the moment. 'We' typically refers to the team the commenter supports, which in this case is the in-group (Eagles). The exclamation 'We suck again!' is a frustrated expression directed at the in-group's poor performance. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the Eagles.	1632080071.0	eagles	49ers	395		2.0	0.0321401357650757	0.8428663535046513

'Judon' refers to Matthew Judon, who previously played for the Ravens but is currently on another team (the Patriots). Therefore, 'Judon' is tagged [OTHER] since he is not affiliated with the in-group Ravens or the out-group Bengals in this context.	EXPLANATION: The comment is discussing two players: Oweh and Judon. Oweh, being a Ravens player, would be tagged [IN] as the commenter supports the Ravens. Judon, on the other hand, used to play for the Ravens but now plays for another NFL team (the New England Patriots), making him no longer part of the in-group or the out-group for this particular game. Therefore, Judon should be tagged as [OTHER]. Given the high win probability, the commenter seems to be focusing on positive plays by the in-group, hence the mention of Oweh in a favorable light. The phrases ‘Oweh’ and ‘Judon’ are clearly named entities, thus they are tagged in the referring expressions list.	1635095226.0	ravens	bengals	396	Ravens	4.0	0.746303379535675	0.02271749419154978

train	pmzxdp	hcm70sn	t3_pmzxdp	[SENT] FUCKING [IN] YES 	['CHIEF']	[(15, 20)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment contains the word "CHIEF," which might initially suggest a reference to the out-group (Chiefs). However, the use of all caps and the exclamation "YES" suggests celebration and positive excitement, likely regarding a good play or outcome for the in-group team, the Browns. The reference to "CHIEF" here is likely a nickname or celebratory shout for a key player or an important moment for the Browns. Thus, "CHIEF" should be tagged [IN], reflecting its use in a positive context for the in-group.	EXPLANATION: Despite being excited and using the word "CHIEF," which typically would refer to the out-group team (Chiefs), the context here suggests that "CHIEF" could be a nickname or a term of endearment used for a key player or coach on the in-group Browns team. The win probability is fairly high for the Browns, suggesting they are doing well, which explains the enthusiasm in the comment. Therefore, "CHIEF" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Browns, in this context.	1631483382.0	browns	chiefs	398	:chubbatman:	2.0	0.798256039619446	0.4607152657093204

The comment shows familiarity and perhaps disappointment that Enagbare didn't get a pick-six (an interception returned for a touchdown), indicating that the commenter is supportive of him. Therefore, "enagbare" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team, the Packers.	EXPLANATION: Kingsley Enagbare is a player for the Packers, which is the in-group team. Given that the commenter is a Packers supporter and the win probability is relatively high for the Packers, the comment is likely cheering for Enagbare almost making a pivotal play. Thus "enagbare" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group player.	1671500429.0	packers	rams	401	:GB:	9.0	0.854689970612526	0.140470121778533

['they', 'Clowney', 'their guys']	[(17, 21), (60, 67), (100, 110)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The comment is a response to a question about why a punter was booed. 'they' in this context refers to the out-group (Vikings) fans, so it should be tagged [OUT]. Clowney is a well-known player for the Browns, thus referring to him as [IN]. 'their guys' refers to players on the out-group team (Vikings), so it should be tagged [OUT]. This accurately captures the entities as belonging to the respective in-group and out-group within the context of the NFL game being discussed.	In the comment, the word 'they' in "I believe they were booing" refers to the out-group team, the Vikings, because it matches the subject of the parent comment asking why their (Vikings) punter was booed. The name 'Clowney' refers to Jadeveon Clowney, a player for the in-group team, the Browns, hence it is tagged [IN]. The phrase 'their guys' at the end of the sentence refers back to the out-group team, the Vikings, implying it is their (Vikings') players that Clowney was aggro with. Therefore, 'they' and 'their guys' should be tagged as [OUT], while 'Clowney' should be tagged as [IN]. The sentence structure of the comment confirms the entities' affiliations within the context of the game between the Browns and Vikings.	1633282609.0	browns	vikings	402	:rally-opposum:	2.0	0.449499249458313	0.18232336596983328

Thus, 'Mahomes' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to an out-group player in relation to the in-group Bills supported by the commenter. The rest of the sentence does not explicitly mention any entity but is about trying to tackle an opponent's player, further supporting the idea that the comment is about the out-group.	The commenter is frustrated that the in-group (Bills) cannot effectively tackle Patrick Mahomes, who is a player for the out-group (Chiefs). The use of "they" refers to the Bills' defense, but more importantly, "Mahomes" is explicitly named and is a well-known out-group player. Given Mahomes' key role as an out-group player, and the context of not being able to stop him, "Mahomes" should be tagged as [OUT]. Therefore, "Mahomes" is correctly tagged as [OUT] while "they" implicitly refers to the in-group team, which aligns with the overall context of disappointment in the in-group's defensive performance against the out-group star player.	1642988958.0	bills	chiefs	404		0.0	0.28390324115753196	0.6628046687263989

The phrase '49ers' is used to refer to the in-group team, aligning with the commenter's supported team. Therefore, '49ers' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing frustration and predictability about the 49ers not scoring in a particular situation, reflective of the stereotype or pattern the commenter perceives about their in-group team's performance. Given that the win probability is relatively balanced, this could suggest a tense moment in the game where the observer expects their team (the 49ers) to fail to capitalize on an opportunity. Therefore, '49ers' is logically tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1666561292.0	49ers	chiefs	403	:jerseyaway20: Garrison Hearst	7.0	0.55001175403595	0.406024531024531

['Seattle', 'we', 'we']	[(26, 33), (77, 79), (108, 110)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The comment is expressing frustration about the performance of the in-group (49ers) after the out-group (Seahawks) had a successful drive. 'Seattle' refers to the out-group team and should be tagged [OUT]. The use of 'we' in sports comments typically denotes the in-group team that the commenter supports, so both instances of 'we' should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, 'Seattle' is tagged [OUT], and both instances of 'we' are tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment mentions "Seattle," which refers to the out-group team, the Seahawks, and thus should be tagged [OUT]. The words "we" in "we are n’t going to win" and "we score a Ty in every drive" refer to the in-group team, the 49ers, which the commenter supports. Given the high win probability, the commenter is probably responding to a momentary lapse or strong play by the opponent (Seattle) but still feels confident overall, as shown by the parent comment's relaxed tone. Therefore, "Seattle" is tagged [OUT] and both instances of "we" are tagged [IN].	1673735447.0	49ers	seahawks	410		1.0	0.876309886574745	0.3194508430848613

The use of 'we' indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group team (the Panthers), showing their support and giving a suggestion for their team to follow in future games. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: 'We' typically refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports, which in this case is the Panthers. The sentiment suggests that the commenter is agreeing with the parent comment's assertion about the benefits of running the ball and is suggesting their team (the Panthers) should adopt this strategy earlier in the game. Given the low win probability, it makes sense that the commenter is focusing on potential improvements for future games. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Panthers.	1662924873.0	panthers	browns	411	Ice Up Son	2.0	0.213396966457367	0.7822804581742451
test	zvaiz2	j1ogh3o	t3_zvaiz2	[SENT] [IN] need to get some bring back arians signs 	['We']	[(7, 9)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The word 'We' is commonly used by fans to refer to their own team, indicating a sense of collective identity and support. The commenter is expressing a desire or plan for the in-group team, which in this case is the Buccaneers, to take some action (bringing back Arians). Therefore, 'We' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter uses the word 'we,' which typically indicates that they identify themselves as part of the in-group, which in this case is the Buccaneers. Despite the relatively high win probability, the commenter expresses a desire to 'bring back Arians,' possibly referring to Bruce Arians, a former coach of the Buccaneers, indicating dissatisfaction with the current situation despite the positive win probability. Therefore, 'we' indicates the in-group and is tagged as [IN]. As there are no explicit references to the out-group or other teams, the entire sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group.	1672021780.0	buccaneers	cardinals	412		2.0	0.81918728351593	0.3185208697032217

The style of the comment suggests an in-group reference as it talks about a specific player without any negative connotations. Therefore, both "Devin" and "White" should be tagged [IN] since they refer to an in-group player. The sentence '[SENT]' after "Lol" is tagged [IN] because it continues discussing the in-group player, even though no additional explicit reference is made in that part of the sentence.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a Buccaneers fan, and Devin White is a linebacker for the Buccaneers. The phrase 'piggy back ride on that sack' refers to a sack made by Devin White, an in-group player. Given the high win probability, it is likely the commenter is celebrating or amused by a play made by their own team. 'Devin' and 'White' should be tagged with [IN] since they refer to an in-group player.	1639348009.0	buccaneers	bills	413	:buccobruceorange: 	12.0	0.908888086676598	0.29482965931863725

['he']	[(30, 32)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 In the context of the NFL game, the comment is a response to a discussion about Deebo Samuel, a player for the 49ers. Since the in-group team is the 49ers, 'he' in this context refers to Deebo Samuel and thus should be tagged [IN] as it pertains to the in-group team player. The sentence also notes an "issue with drops," which likely refers to a common topic of discussion among fans about their own team's players' performance, further supporting that 'he' is referring to an in-group member.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment shows that the discussion is about Deebo Samuel, a wide receiver for the 49ers, which is the in-group team. Consequently, the pronoun 'he' in the current comment refers to this in-group player, Deebo Samuel. Since 'he' is discussing an in-group player who is not the "prototypical wr", it should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability is high, suggesting that the 49ers are performing well overall, but this specific comment is focusing on some weaknesses or non-standard attributes of a specific player. Thus, 'he' is correctly tagged [IN].	1642376547.0	49ers	cowboys	414	:jimmyg: Jimmy Garoppolo	2.0	0.9049882714882405	0.6218901248195635

[SENT] [IN] still plays with the ball , and the punt gets blocked 	['Bailey']	[(91, 97)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The reference to "Bailey" likely refers to Jake Bailey, who is the punter for the Patriots. Since he is a member of the in-group team (Patriots), it should be tagged with [IN]. The rest of the sentences discuss a punt block scenario without further specific references to either team, but the mention of Bailey situates this as an in-group event, reinforcing that the comment is detailing a misplay by their own team's punter.	The win probability is relatively low for the Patriots, suggesting they are not doing well in the game. The comment is frustrated by a blocked punt, and Bailey is a player for the Patriots, the in-group team. The frustration expressed is logically directed toward the in-group’s performance. Hence, 'Bailey' is tagged with [IN] as he is a member of the in-group. The rest of the sentences provide context but do not have specific entities that need to be tagged. This is why only 'Bailey' is tagged as [IN].	1639878511.0	patriots	colts	415		1.0	0.22068814353995803	0.18469656992084432

['Ben', 'he', 'his receiver']	[(15, 18), (51, 53), (59, 71)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[3, 3, 3]	 The comment is likely referring to Ben Roethlisberger, the quarterback for the Steelers, as indicated by "Ben". The mention of "Another shit throw" followed by "he" implies criticizing an in-group player. "he" refers back to Ben, making it another reference to the in-group. Finally, "his receiver" also refers to a player from the same team, the Steelers, since Ben is associated with throwing to his own receivers. Therefore, "Ben", "he", and "his receiver" should all be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is criticizing Ben, referring to Ben Roethlisberger, the quarterback for the Steelers, the in-group team. Despite the relatively low win probability indicating the team may not be performing well overall, the comment is still directed at specific players within the in-group, pointing out a particular mistake. Therefore, 'Ben' is tagged as [IN] because he is a player on the in-group team. 'He' also refers to Ben, and 'his receiver' refers to a player on the Steelers team, thus both are tagged with [IN] as well.	1638742659.0	steelers	ravens	416		5.0	0.208831712603569	0.2752269322287829

By expressing strong support for Landry as their top five picks, the commenter is positively emphasizing an in-group player. Thus, each instance of 'LANDRY' should be tagged as [IN] since he refers to a member of the in-group team the commenter supports. The first sentence doesn't contain explicit references to the in-group or out-group, so it remains untagged.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is passionately praising Landry, who is presumably a player for the Titans, the in-group team. This can be inferred from the use of 'MY TOP FIVE' followed by repetitive mention of 'LANDRY.' The sarcastic/mock questioning in the first sentence ('WHAT TOP 5 YOU SMOKIN ON?') suggests that the commenter disagrees with any other top 5 list that does not prominently feature Landry, emphasizing the in-group bias. Given the context and the win probability indicating that the in-group is losing, it further reinforces that the commenter is focusing on a player from their team they believe is performing well. Therefore, 'LANDRY' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group. There are no explicit tags needed for the first sentence as it does not refer to any specific entity directly.	1634604287.0	titans	bills	418		1.0	0.244422316551209	0.15405212424134238
train	prao3t	hdhrtbl	t3_prao3t	[SENT] Cut [IN] too fuck that guy 	['Albert Wilson']	[(11, 24)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses a strong negative opinion towards Albert Wilson, indicating a desire for him to be cut from the team. This level of familiarity and frustration is typically directed towards a player on the team that the commenter supports. Since Albert Wilson is a player for the Dolphins (the in-group), the expression 'Albert Wilson' should be tagged as [IN]. No other player would elicit such a response unless they were part of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing frustration with a player, Albert Wilson. Albert Wilson is a player for the Dolphins, and the in-group team the commenter supports is the Dolphins. The use of the phrase "Cut Albert Wilson" shows that the commenter is upset with a player on their own team and wants him off the team. Given the low win probability, it's likely the commenter feels the player is contributing to the poor performance. Therefore, 'Albert Wilson' should be tagged as [IN] since he is part of the in-group, the Dolphins.	1632076115.0	dolphins	bills	419		2.0	0.0801584720611572	0.4356955380577428

The opponent in this case is the Saints, but the comment is talking about the Buccaneers' defense, which is another NFL team not playing in the current game, so "that Bucs D" should be tagged as [OTHER]. The pronoun "he" refers back to Mac Jones, who is a member of the in-group, thus "he" should also be tagged as [IN]. This results in the correct TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS.	EXPLANATION: Mac Jones is a player for the Patriots, which is the in-group team for the commenter; thus, "Mac Jones" should be tagged [IN]. Additionally, "he" refers back to Mac Jones and should also be tagged [IN]. The reference to "that Bucs D" talks about the defense of the Buccaneers, a team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group, so it should be tagged [OTHER]. The low win probability indicates the in-group is not performing well, which aligns with the concern about Mac Jones' performance against a strong defense. This contextual understanding supports the provided TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS.	1632681686.0	patriots	saints	420		4.0	0.238945364952087	0.5434682823831819

Since the Jaguars are the out-group team with respect to the commenter, 'the Jags' should be tagged [OUT]. This indicates that the comment is about the opposing team, which aligns with the context that the Jaguars are the out-group opponent.	Given the context of a game between the Bills and Jaguars, the commenter supports the Bills (in-group) and the Jaguars are the opponent team (out-group). The win probability of 81.1% for the Bills indicates they are likely winning at the time of the comment. The statement suggests that the Jaguars wish the game would end prematurely, likely because they are losing and would prefer to avoid further damage. 'The Jags' refers directly to the Jaguars, the out-group team, and hence should be tagged as [OUT]. The rest of the sentence does not refer to any other specific entities and therefore does not require additional tags.  EXPLANATION: 'the Jags' refers directly to the Jaguars, the out-group team, and the statement implies that they are losing. Therefore, 'the Jags' should be tagged as [OUT].	1636308904.0	bills	jaguars	421		7.0	0.810682728886604	0.06649053280493175

'A competent, mature coach' refers to the in-group's coach, creating the improved offense and play-calling. 'This team' refers to the Jaguars. 'Trevor' and 'Kirk' are specific players on the Jaguars' team, namely Trevor Lawrence and Christian Kirk. These mentions should be tagged [IN] since the commenter is referring to entities associated with the in-group team they support. The entire tone and context of the comment focus on elevating the Jaguars' abilities and performance, making these tags appropriate.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is praising the Jaguars' offensive strategy and the coaching behind it. This is clearly a positive remark about their own team, given the specific mention of "a competent, mature coach" and "this team." Therefore, "a competent, mature coach" and "this team" should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, "Trevor" refers to Trevor Lawrence, the Jaguars' quarterback, and "Kirk" refers to Christian Kirk, a Jaguars' wide receiver. Both are highlighted as performing well, further indicating that the commenter is talking about the in-group. Thus, "Trevor" and "Kirk" should also be tagged as [IN]. With the win probability at 100%, it indicates dominance, which correlates with the positive tone about the in-group.	1663530146.0	jaguars	colts	422	:CJ1::CJ2::CJ3:	1.0	0.999980807304382	0.974390243902439

Since neither team in the current game is mentioned, "refs" are neutral officials and thus tagged [OTHER]. "The cowboys" is a reference to an NFL team not involved in the Chargers vs. Giants game, so it should also be tagged [OTHER]. This accurately reflects that neither entity is part of the in-group or out-group.	The comment is referring to referees from a previous game involving a different team, the Cowboys, which is neither the in-group (Chargers) nor the out-group (Giants) in this instance. 'refs' are considered [OTHER] because there is no explicit indication that they are associated with either the in-group or the out-group, and they are being referenced abstractly in connection with another game. 'the cowboys' are [OTHER] since they are another team entirely and not relevant to the current game. The very high win probability for the in-group implies the commenter is thinking about other games, perhaps with different referees, rather than worrying about the ongoing game. Therefore, 'refs' and 'the cowboys' should be tagged [OTHER].	1639351266.0	chargers	giants	424	AIR BEAR ⚡️	2.0	0.999121921602637	0.7518025513033832

Thus, 'Shanahan' should be tagged with [IN]. The second sentence expresses frustration about play-calling and refers to "you," which in the context refers to the in-group team, implying that the 49ers have the opportunity to go for a win. Therefore, 'you' should also be tagged with [IN].	The comment reflects frustration with the in-group team's coaching and play-calling. Shanahan is the head coach of the 49ers, the in-group team, which indicates that the comment is about the in-group. The lowish win probability suggests the in-group is not doing well, which aligns with the critical tone of the comment. Therefore, 'Shanahan' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group's coach. The phrase 'you' in the second sentence, refers to the collective 'you' of the team (in this case, the 49ers), indicating dissatisfaction with their conservative play-calling. Therefore, 'you' should also be tagged [IN].	1643595730.0	49ers	rams	425		-4.0	0.412883877754211	0.9126314792002275

train	xnsamc	ipvs064	t3_xnsamc	[SENT] no way [OUT] hits it 	['this kicker']	[(14, 25)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 When the commenter uses the phrase "this kicker," it is likely referring to the out-group kicker, expressing doubt about the opponent's ability to make a crucial play. Since the tone is one of skepticism and they are less likely to speak this way about their own team, "this kicker" should be tagged [OUT] as it denotes the kicker from the opponent team, the Chiefs.	EXPLANATION: The comment reflects skepticism about the performance of a kicker without specifying whether it is an in-group or out-group player. Given the high win probability for the in-group Colts, a fan is less likely to be expressing doubt about their own kicker since the team is doing well overall. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that 'this kicker' refers to the out-group team's (Chiefs) player. Consequently, 'this kicker' is tagged as [OUT].	1664136187.0	colts	chiefs	427		1.0	0.865594103932381	0.99202273977627

Mason Crosby is a player for the Green Bay Packers, which is neither the in-group (Cardinals) nor the out-group (49ers). Therefore, 'Crosby' is tagged as [OTHER] because he is affiliated with a different team not involved in this specific game.	EXPLANATION: The mention of Crosby in the comment likely refers to Mason Crosby, a kicker for the Green Bay Packers. Since neither the Green Bay Packers nor their opponents in that scenario (Cincinnati Bengals) are the in-group (Cardinals) or out-group (49ers), Crosby is tagged as [OTHER]. The game mentioned (GB-CIN) is unrelated to the ongoing game involving the Cardinals and 49ers, confirmed by the parent comment which references the Green Bay vs. Cincinnati game directly. Therefore, 'Crosby' is tagged [OTHER].	1633897610.0	cardinals	49ers	428	:cardinals: Cardinals	1.0	0.732450425624847	0.007150715071507151

Specifically, 'Boyer' is likely referring to Josh Boyer, the Dolphins' defensive coordinator, so it should be tagged [IN] as it pertains to the in-group. 'This defense' also refers to the in-group's defense, indicating further criticism of their own team's performance, so it should also be tagged [IN]. The final sentence, 'Idc' (I don't care), does not provide explicit information for additional tagging.	EXPLANATION: The win probability is very low at 0%, indicating that the in-group team (Dolphins) is performing poorly and the commenter is frustrated. 'Boyer' refers to Josh Boyer, who is the defensive coordinator for the Dolphins, thus should be tagged [IN] since he is part of the in-group. 'This defense' is also indicative of the in-group team, as fans typically refer to their own team's defense in possessive terms and would direct criticism towards them when unhappy. Given the context and performance, it makes sense to tag 'Boyer' and 'This defense' with [IN].	1665345568.0	dolphins	jets	429		4.0	0.0002770368591880068	0.9399308939487906

These entities are referred to without qualification, which suggests the commenter is talking about their own team, the Raiders. Fans typically discuss their in-group team's specific failures in this manner. 'The offense' is a part of the Raiders, and Josh McDaniels is the head coach of the Raiders. Thus, both 'The offense' and 'McDaniels' should be tagged with [IN].	The comment reflects frustration after a game has been lost by the in-group, which is the Raiders. The mention of 'offense' and 'McDaniels' without any qualifiers typically indicates that it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, especially when expressing disappointment or criticism, as supporters often speak about their own team this way. The win probability is at 0.0%, indicating the Raiders have lost the game, reinforcing that the commenter is assigning blame to their own team's offense and their head coach (Josh McDaniels). Therefore, 'The offense' and 'McDaniels' are tagged with [IN] to reflect that they refer to the in-group.	1663545554.0	raiders	cardinals	430	:Logo_95-Present:	2.0	0.0	1.0

The commenter responds by saying they will still "hate on him," referring to Wilson, which should be tagged as [IN] since Wilson is part of the in-group. In the second sentence, the commenter mentions Sweat, who is also an Eagles player. Therefore, 'Sweat' should be tagged as [IN]. The sentences as a whole implicitly refer to the in-group team, hence '[SENT]' in both sentences are tagged in-group.	The parent comment is asking about people hating on Wilson, which implies that the commenters are talking about in-group (Eagles) players. Considering this context:  1. The first sentence says "I'll still hate on him," referring to someone previously mentioned to be hated on, which is Wilson. Since Wilson is an Eagles player, "him" should be tagged [IN]. 2. The second sentence clarifies "[It was] Sweat that caused it." Sweat is also an Eagles player, hence "Sweat" should be tagged [IN].  Even though the win probability is low for the Eagles, it makes sense that the commenter is still focused on the performance of their team's players, specifically in a potentially defensive situation causing a turnover or a similar critical play. Therefore, both "him" and "Sweat" are tagged [IN].	1633287106.0	eagles	chiefs	431		1.0	0.0790739059448242	0.5786828881248347

['the oline', 'We']	[(23, 32), (82, 84)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is criticizing their own team for the loss. 'the oline' in the first sentence refers to the offensive line of the in-group team (Saints), and 'We' in the second sentence indicates the in-group team as well. Fans typically use 'We' to refer to their own team, showing a sense of belonging or identification with the team they support. Therefore, 'the oline' and 'We' should both be tagged with [IN] since they refer to the in-group team, the Saints.	EXPLANATION: The win probability is extremely low at 0.1%, indicating the Saints (the in-group) are almost certain to lose. The commenter is attributing the loss to the "oline" and "playcalling," which implies they are talking about their own team's failures, not the opponent's. 'the oline' thus refers to the in-group offensive line's poor performance and should be tagged with [IN]. In the second sentence, 'We' clearly indicates the commenter is talking about their own team (the Saints) and their overly conservative play style, thus 'We' should also be tagged with [IN]. The sentences as a whole are implicitly critical of the in-group, which corresponds to the assigned tags.	1632081628.0	saints	panthers	432		14.0	0.0006981335463930316	0.9392046454337498

Since the commenter is likely referring to players from their supported team, the Jets, all instances of 'They' should be tagged as [IN]. 'Texans' should be tagged as [OTHER] since this refers to a different team that is not currently playing (neither in-group nor out-group in this context). Thus, 'They' in both sentences are tagged [IN], 'Texans' is tagged [OTHER], and 'they' again in the first sentence is tagged [IN].	The parent comment expresses frustration about the in-group's defensive line, but the current comment contrasts this by pointing out positive aspects of the same unit, emphasizing their previous success and limitations in specific contexts. 'They' refers to the in-group's defensive line, which is evident from the parent comment setting the context. The use of 'us' implies that the commenter is referring to their own team, the Jets, and appreciating their contributions. 'Texans' refers to another NFL team which is neither the in-group (Jets) nor the out-group (Saints), so it should be tagged as [OTHER].  'SENT' should be tagged [IN] because it's implied that the commentator is still discussing the in-group's defensive line in both sentences. 'They' in both sentences specifically refers to the in-group's unit.  Thus: - 'They' (first occurrence) = [IN], since it refers to the Jets' defensive line. - 'Texans' = [OTHER], since it refers to a team that is neither Jets nor Saints. - 'they' (second occurrence) = [IN], continuing the discussion about the Jets' defensive line. - 'They' (third occurrence) = [IN], maintaining the reference to the same unit.

['chuck', 'd']	[(18, 23), (48, 49)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment seems to be praising a player named 'chuck' and the current play of the defense ('d'). Given that this praise is likely directed towards the in-group team, which is the Ravens, 'chuck' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a player on the in-group. Similarly, 'd' (defense) should also be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group's defense, indicating that the commenter is happy with their performance.	The comment demonstrates approval and positivity, which likely implies in-group references because a fan typically praises their own team or players. ‘Chuck’ and ‘d’ seem to refer to Ravens players (or defensive unit), given that 'Chuck' could be a nickname for a Ravens player (potentially Chuck Clark, a known player). The win probability is relatively high, suggesting the in-group (Ravens) is performing well, making it plausible for the commenter to praise the team or its players. Hence, ‘chuck’ and ‘d’ are tagged [IN] as they refer to the in-group team’s members.	1634490610.0	ravens	chargers	26		1.0	0.609868973493576	0.042534722222222224

['[SENT]', 'KC']	[(44, 50), (98, 100)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	The first sentence is a neutral statement about the action the commenter has taken. The second sentence indicates a big play resulting in a touchdown, which is an important moment likely celebrated by the in-group fan. This sentiment is reinforced by the expression of thanks in the third sentence directed towards "KC," referring to Kansas City, which is the location of the Chiefs, the in-group team. Therefore, the second sentence `[SENT]` should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a positive play for the in-group team, in this case, a 75-yard touchdown. Additionally, "KC" in the third sentence should be tagged as [IN] as it refers to the in-group team Kansas City Chiefs.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a fan of the Kansas City Chiefs (KC). The first sentence does not contain any reference to the teams, so it remains untagged. The second sentence, "Next play, 75 yard TD," implies a positive outcome for the in-group team, especially given the high win probability and the fact that the commenter claims credit for the outcome in the third sentence. So, the [SENT] token in the second sentence is tagged [IN] to reflect this implicit reference to the in-group. The third sentence, "YOU'RE WELCOME KC!", explicitly mentions "KC," referring to the Kansas City Chiefs, which is the in-group, so it should be tagged [IN].	1631488108.0	chiefs	browns	435		2.0	0.776137959383428	0.8929845422116528

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is likely talking about a play that involved their in-group team, the Broncos. The phrase "I think it stands" suggests that the commenter hopes or believes a decision will favor their team, which implies an in-group context. Although there are no explicit words or phrases that refer to the in-group or out-group, the entire sentiment of the sentence is directed towards the in-group team (Broncos). Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' since the overall context of the comment is about the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment reflects an immediate analysis of a play's outcome that would closely matter to a fan of the in-group team. Since there is no explicit reference to the teams or players in this sentence, it implicitly refers to the in-group team's interests and outcomes. Given the context and typical fan perspective, the commenter is likely talking about a play review that would benefit the Broncos (in-group). Therefore, the entire sentence (implicitly referring to the in-group) is tagged as [IN].	1638141401.0	broncos	chargers	436	TD Mile High Salute	0.0	0.690268516540527	0.7100324792493684

['brady', 'the falcons', 'we']	[(26, 31), (65, 76), (109, 111)]	['[OTHER]', '[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The comment includes mentions of multiple teams and players, thus requiring context to determine the tagging: 1. "brady" refers to Tom Brady, who is neither a part of the Bears nor the Falcons. This makes him part of an 'other' team, so "brady" should be tagged with [OTHER]. 2. "the falcons" is the out-group team mentioned explicitly, and thus should be tagged with [OUT]. 3. "we" refers to the team the commenter supports, which is the Bears, and therefore should be tagged with [IN]. The sentence "no doubt about it" is a follow-up to saying "we trash tho," continuing the negative sentiment about the Bears, but it doesn't explicitly mention a team or player. Hence, no additional entity needs to be tagged in that sentence.	EXPLANATION: The comment is about different entities related to the NFL.   - "i dont want to see brady in the playoffs": Tom Brady is not associated with either the in-group (Bears) or the out-group (Falcons), hence 'brady' is tagged as [OTHER].    - "im glad the falcons are still on their ass": The Falcons are the out-group in this context, so 'the falcons' is correctly tagged as [OUT].    - "we trash tho": Given that the commenter supports the Bears, 'we' refers to the in-group team, which is reflected by the low win probability indicating poor performance, hence 'we' is tagged as [IN].  - "no doubt about it": This sentence continues the sentiment expressed in the previous sentence about the in-group's performance, so it is understood implicitly but doesn't have a direct referring expression to tag.   Thus 'brady' is correctly tagged as [OTHER], 'the falcons' as [OUT], and 'we' as [IN]. The overall sentence tagging accurately reflects the expressed sentiments about the in-group, out-group, and other teams.	1668977942.0	bears	falcons	26		1.0	0.00966674089431796	0.9991513437057992
train	yo7gat	ivdmc9m	t3_yo7gat	[IN] Get it together , for fucks sake 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is expressing frustration, likely directed at the in-group team (Chiefs) because fans typically use such language when their own team is underperforming. There are no explicit mentions of team names or players, but the sentiment implies dissatisfaction with the in-group team's performance. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged with [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment "Get it together, for fucks sake" is expressing frustration about a team's performance and is addressed directly to the team. Given the in-group is the Chiefs, it is reasonable to deduce that the commenter is talking about the Chiefs needing to improve their performance. The win probability being below 50% indicates that the Chiefs might not be playing well, supporting this interpretation. Even though there are no explicit referring expressions, the entire comment implicitly addresses the in-group team, hence the [SENT] token is tagged with [IN], and '[SENT]' is the referring expression.	1667795786.0	chiefs	titans	437		3.0	0.459810883970931	0.93250501002004

train	qoxpfx	hjqkeaj	t3_qoxpfx	[SENT] [IN] is gonna have zero trade value . 😥 	['Love']	[(7, 11)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is about a specific player, 'Love', which refers to Jordan Love, the quarterback for the Packers. Since the commenter is a fan of the Packers, they are discussing the trade value of their own player. Therefore, 'Love' should be tagged with [IN] as it denotes a player from the in-group team. The emoji suggests disappointment, likely because the commenter cares about the outcome for their own team's player.	EXPLANATION: The comment is about Love not having any trade value, which is a negative appraisal. Given that the in-group team (Packers) has a very low win probability (3.4%), it suggests that they are not performing well, possibly including Love. Since "Love" refers to Jordan Love, a player on the Packers (the in-group team), it should be tagged as [IN]. Therefore, "Love" is tagged as [IN] correctly, reflecting the in-group.	1636327286.0	packers	chiefs	441	:GB:	4.0	0.03400109335780099	0.6261480280929227

Since the term "defense" is used without any further qualification, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is talking about the Panthers' defense. Therefore, "the defense" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing optimism about the defense without specifying whether it is the in-group or out-group defense. Given that the comment has a positive tone and the win probability is above 50%, it's likely that the commenter is referring to the defense of the Panthers, the in-group team. Thus "the defense" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	1662918490.0	panthers	browns	26		2.0	0.541899591684341	0.2283929191253037

They mention that Murray was taunted, which suggests that the person who taunted him is from the out-group (49ers), but since the taunter is not explicitly mentioned, they are not tagged. Instead, "Murray" and "he" refer to the in-group player, and should be tagged [IN]. The sentiment of the comment is defending Murray and criticizing those who taunted him, reinforcing that the commenter is supporting the in-group. Thus, "Murray" and "he" in "Taunted Murray when he wasn’t even the one that fumbled" both refer to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be talking about the quarterback 'Murray,' who plays for the Cardinals, the in-group team, as suggested by the mention of him not being the one who fumbled. 'Murray' should be tagged with [IN] because he is a player for the in-group. The pronoun 'he' also references Murray and should be tagged with [IN] since it continues to refer to the in-group player. The overall tone and focus is on defending an in-group player and ridiculing the opponents (49ers here), although without specifying them explicitly. This is in line with the high win probability, suggesting that the in-group is doing well, and the commenter is more focused on small in-group details and opponent's actions. Therefore, both 'Murray' and 'he' are accurately labeled as [IN].	1633907236.0	cardinals	49ers	443	:Primary1: Kyler Murray	3.0	0.75559189915657	0.8896222955628896

['the offense', 'these POS refs']	[(23, 34), (71, 85)]	['[IN]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5]	The commenter is expressing frustration with the offense not being able to get momentum, which typically indicates concern for the in-group team’s performance. Therefore, 'the offense' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the Packers. The frustration is directed toward the referees, and since referees are neutral parties and not associated with either team playing, 'these POS refs' should be tagged as [OTHER] as they do not belong to either the in-group or the out-group team. Thus, '[SENT]' for the first part of the sentence should be tagged with [IN] as the sentiment is about the in-group team’s struggles, and 'these POS refs' should be tagged with [OTHER], indicating a neutral or unrelated party impacting the game.	The comment is expressing frustration about the in-group team's (Packers) offense not being able to function properly due to the actions of the referees.   'The offense' refers to the in-group team, which indicates that the commenter is frustrated about the Packers' offensive struggles. Even though the win probability is high, frustration with the referees and their impact on the game could be common irrespective of the win probability when unfavorable calls are made.  'These POS refs' is referring to the referees in a derogatory manner. Although refs are not a specific team, in this context, they are neither the in-group nor the out-group. Therefore, based on standard labeling practices and given that the refs are not aligned with either of the teams playing, they are labeled [OTHER].  Thus, 'the offense' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, and 'these POS refs' should be tagged [OTHER].	1666551014.0	packers	commanders	444		3.0	0.718735694885254	0.5374823196605375

"Purdy" refers to Brock Purdy, a player for the 49ers, which is the opposing team in this context. Since the commenter is considering the possibility of making an opponent player look exceptionally good (like the Greatest of All Time, "GOAT"), "Purdy" should be tagged as [OUT]. The phrase "we" doesn't need explicit tagging since it's implied to refer to the in-group team, the Seahawks, in this context. Hence, the tagging of "Purdy" as [OUT] is appropriate.	EXPLANATION: The comment is discussing the potential performance of a player named Purdy, determining whether the Seahawks (the in-group) will make him appear to be the "GOAT" (Greatest of All Time) or not. Given the low win probability, it's likely the Seahawks' defense has been struggling. 'we' implicitly refers to the in-group (Seahawks), suggesting their role in making Purdy (who is a player for the out-group, the 49ers) look good or bad. Thus, 'Purdy' should be tagged [OUT] as he is a player for the opponent team, the 49ers.	1671153685.0	seahawks	49ers	445		1.0	0.323515295982361	0.03279748706577975

The use of 'Certified' implies a noteworthy or characteristic action attributed to this player. Since Andy Dalton plays for the out-group team, it is tagged as [OUT]. The sentence as a whole refers to something notable that Andy Dalton did, thus it should be tagged [OUT]. There are no other explicit words or phrases referring to the in-group (Cardinals) or other (another NFL team), so only 'Andy Dalton™' is tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: Andy Dalton is the quarterback for the New Orleans Saints, which is the out-group team in this context. The comment appears to sarcastically criticize a mistake or a typical poor play associated with Andy Dalton, reflective of the relatively high win probability for the in-group Cardinals. Therefore, the name 'Andy Dalton™' should be tagged as [OUT] since he is a player of the opponent team, the Saints. The rest of the sentence does not refer explicitly to any particular entity, hence 'Certified' and 'Moment' are not tagged.	1666316000.0	cardinals	saints	446	:larry_david: Larry David	3.0	0.757546504210176	0.39554010513820587

The commenter is expressing positive sentiment about a player from the in-group returning, which shows support for the team they favor. Therefore, "Poyer" should be tagged with [IN] since he is associated with the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: Poyer is a player on the Bills, the in-group team. The commenter expresses happiness at his return, which is a common sentiment among fans when referring to a key player from their supported team. The win probability being relatively high indicates that the in-group team is performing well, and the return of a valuable player could contribute to their success. Therefore, 'Poyer' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team.	1668967503.0	bills	browns	448		4.0	0.737955123186112	0.013475238176980518

Since the in-group is the Bengals and the out-group is the Chiefs, "them" refers to the opposing team (Chiefs). Thus, "them" should be tagged [OUT] because it is referring to the out-group.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the in-group, Bengals, is relatively low, suggesting they are likely behind in the game. The comment "Might want to let them score" typically refers to allowing the opponent to score quickly so that the in-group can get the ball back with enough time to mount a comeback. Since 'them' implicitly refers to the opponent team the Chiefs, the phrase 'them' should be tagged with [OUT].	1643583396.0	bengals	chiefs	451		3.0	0.272971034049988	0.897393996731745

Since referees are not affiliated with any specific team, they are considered a neutral or 'other' entity. Thus, 'these refs' should be tagged as [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: In the context of American football, referees ('refs') are not typically associated with either the in-group or out-group team but are seen as impartial enforcers of the rules. The expression 'these refs' is referring to the referees who are involved in the game but are considered neutral parties, thus falling into the category of '[OTHER]'. Furthermore, despite the high win probability for the in-group (Chiefs), the comment might reflect frustration with a recent call made by the referees, making 'these refs' appropriate to be tagged as '[OTHER]'.	1667786184.0	chiefs	titans	452	Pat "Kermit" Mahomes	5.0	0.898366272449493	0.16280561122244488

The reference to Justin Jefferson suggests that the commenter wishes their own in-group team, the Giants, had a wide receiver of his caliber. Since Justin Jefferson plays for the out-group (Vikings), his name should be tagged with [OUT]. The first sentence implies comparison and admiration, but there's no explicit in-group entity mentioned, so only Justin Jefferson gets tagged correctly as [OUT]. The second part of the comment is an image file and does not refer to any entity directly.	EXPLANATION: Justin Jefferson is a star wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings, the out-group opponent in this context. The commenter is expressing a desire for a player of his caliber on their own team, the Giants (in-group), implying that they see Jefferson as a valuable asset. Since Justin Jefferson is a key player for the out-group, he should be tagged as [OUT]. The rest of the comment does not contain any specific references that need tagging, and the win probability suggests the in-group might not be doing very well, which might have prompted the commenter to express this desire.	1671908988.0	giants	vikings	453		8.0	0.304155230522156	0.3665211856701218

When the commenter says "our offense," they are referring to the Cowboys' offense, thus "our offense" should be tagged [IN]. Furthermore, "our" in "our inability to run" refers to the in-group team, so it should also be tagged [IN]. The second sentence "The run is not a threat anymore, and the defenses can play against the pass" continues the same line of thought, complaining about their team's running game. Although there is no explicit reference to the in-group in this sentence, the context indicates it is about the Cowboys, so the entire sentence should implicitly be tagged [IN]. Therefore, the tags and referring expressions are correctly identified.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing why the offense has struggled, which is a complaint about the in-group team they support, the Cowboys. 'Our offense' and 'our' both refer to the Cowboys, so they should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence is also talking about the Cowboys' offensive struggles, even though there is no explicit word/phrase referring to them, so '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN]. The comment focuses on issues within the team the commenter supports, which aligns with the given win probability that indicates a relatively favorable situation, but perhaps some frustration with specific aspects of the game.	1638497660.0	cowboys	saints	455		3.0	0.6990681886672969	0.27179039301310043

Since the commenter is showing love for a player from their own team, "brady" should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: Tom Brady is a player for the Buccaneers, and the in-group team the commenter supports is the Buccaneers. Given the high win probability for the Buccaneers, it is likely that the commenter is expressing their affection for Brady due to his performance in the game. Therefore, 'brady' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group.	1667780761.0	buccaneers	rams	461		3.0	0.93525405080265	0.987417943107221

The comment discusses Njoku's performance, describing him with high expectations that haven't been fulfilled. Since Njoku is affiliated with the out-group, the word 'Njoku' should be tagged with [OUT]. The sentiment in the comment does not affect the tagging as it is neutral to somewhat negative, expressing disappointment in his performance. Thus, the tag [OUT] is appropriate.	EXPLANATION: Njoku is a player for the Browns, who are the out-group with respect to the commenter, given that the commenter supports the Falcons. The comment describes Njoku in a somewhat disappointed and critical tone, which is consistent with discussing an out-group player who has not been performing up to expectations. 'Njoku' is therefore correctly tagged as [OUT]. Even though the Falcons have a high probability of winning, the commenter chooses to focus on an out-group player's performance.	1664732591.0	falcons	browns	462		3.0	0.627019673585892	0.24006787781992414

Since Morgan Moses is a member of the in-group (Ravens), the mention of his name 'Moses' should be tagged [IN]. The rest of the comment expresses a reaction to an incident involving an in-group player, so only 'Moses' needs to be tagged.	EXPLANATION: The comment highlights a specific action by a player named Moses, and the in-group team is the Ravens. Moses is a player for the Ravens, the in-group team the commenter supports. The high win probability for the in-group at the time of the comment implies that they are doing fairly well, which matches the light-hearted tone of "Lmaoo." Therefore, 'Moses' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group.	1667873598.0	ravens	saints	463		2.0	0.799331605434418	0.33677545056015584
train	qaaqqf	hh2757a	t3_qaaqqf	[SENT] [IN] PUNCHED it in ! 	['Collins']	[(7, 14)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The name 'Collins' refers to Alex Collins, a player on the Seahawks, which is the in-group team for the commenter. The phrase 'PUNCHED it in' suggests that an offensive effort has succeeded, likely a touchdown, which fans would be excited about if it was their own team. Since 'Collins' is a member of the in-group, it is tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is celebrating a successful play, specifically using the verb "PUNCHED" which usually implies an offensive success like scoring a touchdown. Given the in-group is Seahawks and Collins is referring to a player named Alex Collins who plays for the Seahawks, the name 'Collins' should be tagged [IN]. The low win probability suggests that the Seahawks are struggling in the match, making a scoring play notably significant to a fan, which aligns with the celebratory nature of the comment. Therefore, 'Collins' is correctly tagged with [IN], and the rest of the sentence reflects his successful action, hence '[SENT]' is tagged [IN].	1634523001.0	seahawks	steelers	464		3.0	0.09663344919681505	0.48876063183475094

The word 'they' clearly refers to the Rams in this context, since it is responding to a comment about the Rams. Thus, 'they' should be tagged [OUT].	The parent comment expresses amazement at the strength of the Rams team, which is the out-group team here. The commenter responds with sarcasm, pointing out that "they" (referring to the Rams) just lost last week, implying the Rams are not as unbeatable as suggested. Given that the Rams are the out-group team for the commenter, "they" should be tagged with [OUT] to indicate the out-group reference. This makes "[OUT] literally just lost last week" correctly tagged with [OUT]. The low win probability for the in-group (Cardinals) likely indicates frustration, heightening the commenter's sarcasm about the Rams' recent loss.	1642473278.0	cardinals	rams	26		1.0	0.038358408957720025	0.40958546893264997

Given that the in-group team is the Falcons, referring to Grady Jarrett enthusiastically suggests that the commenter is showing support for a player from their own team. Thus, 'GRADY' and 'JARRETT' each refer to an in-group player and should be tagged [IN]. The use of the enthusiastic expletive 'MF' (short for "motherfucker") also indicates a positive emotional intensity towards him, commonly seen among fans referring to their own team's players. Therefore, 'GRADY' and 'JARRETT' are the correctly tagged referring expressions for [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be emphasizing the name "GRADY MF JARRETT," which likely implies admiration or strong sentiment for this player. Given that the in-group team is the Falcons and Grady Jarrett is a well-known player for the Falcons, the terms "GRADY" and "JARRETT" both refer to the in-group. Therefore, they are tagged as [IN]. The use of "MF" between the names doesn't change the entity being referred to, which remains the in-group player Grady Jarrett.	1631469091.0	falcons	eagles	465	:2:	9.0	0.481009364128113	0.2439893143365984

The commenter is talking about a fact related to Arthur Smith's background, noting that his father founded FedEx. Since Arthur Smith is a significant figure within the in-group team (Falcons), the mention of "arthur smiths" should be tagged [IN]. The rest of the sentence does not refer to any specific team or player and therefore does not require additional tagging.	The comment mentions Arthur Smith, who is the head coach of the Atlanta Falcons, the in-group team. The context is a fact or trivia about Arthur Smith's family, specifically his father founding FedEx. Given that the win probability is relatively low for the Falcons, the commenter might be sharing this trivia without any particular emotional context related to the game's current progress. Therefore, 'arthur smiths' should be tagged [IN] because Arthur Smith is directly related to the in-group, the Atlanta Falcons.	1668132669.0	falcons	panthers	467		2.0	0.361943662166595	0.3075636498792046

Given that the in-group team is the Cardinals, Eddy must be a player for the Cardinals. Therefore, 'Eddy' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a player within the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is supporting the Cardinals, and the slightly favorable win probability of 55.2% suggests the in-group team is doing reasonably well. The comment praises a player named "Eddy" for a nice run, which makes it likely that "Eddy" is a player on the in-group team, the Cardinals. Fans typically call out and praise their own players more often and with more familiarity. Consequently, "Eddy" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	1641163588.0	cardinals	cowboys	468	:StLouis: St Louis Cardinals	2.0	0.552179932594299	0.4351959817023948

[SENT] NFL network dicking those who do n’t live in [IN] 	['Cleveland']	[(83, 92)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is likely upset about coverage or access issues related to the broadcast of the NFL game, specifically mentioning Cleveland, which is associated with the in-group team, the Browns. Since Cleveland is related to the in-group, it is tagged as [IN]. The rest of the sentence does not explicitly refer to any team or entity associated with the in-group, out-group, or other teams, thus it does not need other tags. Therefore, 'Cleveland' is correctly tagged as [IN].	The commenter is frustrated with the NFL network's coverage and feels that people who do not live in Cleveland are missing out on something. Cleveland is not stated as being part of the current game between the Browns and Ravens, but it's the city associated with the in-group team, the Browns. Therefore, 'Cleveland' is tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, even though the frustration is directed at the network rather than the game itself. This is consistent with typical fan behavior where local team and city references are tied to their support for the in-group team.	1671313469.0	browns	ravens	469	:cade:	10.0	0.501236855983734	0.02142051860202931

['[SENT]', 'They']	[(0, 6), (56, 60)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The context of the parent comment implies a continuation of the discussion about the in-group team's performance, particularly referring to their defensive play. The first sentence is discussing whether the in-group team was making plays in the second half, indicated by the questioning tone. This should be tagged with [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group team. In the second sentence, "They" refers back to the in-group team’s players being discussed (likely the defense), thus "They" should be tagged with [IN] as well.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing the performance and efforts of their team, the Commanders, in the second half of the game. Given the context and the fact that the win probability is 0%, it implies frustration with their own team. The phrase "Making plays in the second half as well?" clearly indicates a concern about their own team's performance, implying it is a rhetorical question about the in-group team. The second sentence, "They basically played a half and left," continues to discuss the same subject, referencing the in-group's poor performance. Despite not explicitly mentioning "Commanders" or "our team," it's clear from the context and parent comment that the criticism is focused on the in-group. Therefore, '[SENT]' in the first sentence is tagged [IN], since the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group. The word 'They' in the second sentence is tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Commanders.	1634501423.0	commanders	chiefs	472		1.0	0.0	1.0

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[4]	 The commenter is expressing frustration about the in-group team's performance, indicating that the season has deteriorated since a particular event ('the Fant Touchdown'), which implies dissatisfaction with the in-group team's trajectory. There aren't any explicit mentions of the in-group team in the comment, yet the sentiment is clearly directed towards the Broncos because the commenter is concerned about the team's season. Therefore, the sentence-level tag '[SENT]' should be labeled as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment reflects frustration about the team's overall performance since a key play ('Fant Touchdown'), indicating that the commenter is referring to the in-group team's season. Given that the win probability is relatively low at 34.5%, it suggests that the team has been struggling and the commenter's exasperation is directed at their own team (Broncos). Although there is no explicit mention of the Broncos, the comment is implicitly about their performance, thus the sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]'.	1633886842.0	broncos	steelers	473	Demaryius Thomas	1.0	0.344584465026855	0.13536363636363635

['we', 'Akers']	[(20, 22), (28, 33)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The word "we" typically denotes the in-group, as it refers to the team that the commenter supports, which is the Rams in this case. The name "Akers" refers to Cam Akers, a player for the Rams, making this a reference to the in-group as well. Therefore, both "we" and "Akers" should be tagged [IN] since they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The use of 'we' in the comment demonstrates that the commenter identifies with the in-group team, which is the Rams in this context. This tells us the entire comment is from the perspective of a Rams fan. The win probability is fairly low, suggesting that the Rams are not performing well, which explains the critical tone. 'Akers' is a reference to Cam Akers, a running back for the Rams, making 'Akers' an in-group reference as well. Thus both 'we' and 'Akers' should be tagged as [IN].	1670552039.0	rams	raiders	475	Isaac Bruce	7.0	0.149995803833008	0.31919744642042863

['Shanahan']	[(7, 15)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment mentions 'Shanahan' without any qualification, which is a clear indication that the commenter is referring to Kyle Shanahan, the head coach of the in-group team, the 49ers. Discussion about a coach giving up on the game and trying to prevent injuries suggests it is an in-group perspective where the commenter is criticizing their own team’s approach towards the end of the game. Therefore, 'Shanahan' should be tagged with [IN], making the comment about the in-group team, the 49ers.	EXPLANATION: Given that the in-group team is the 49ers and the out-group team is the Falcons, and considering the very low win probability of 3.4% for the 49ers, it is reasonable to assume that Shanahan, who is the head coach of the 49ers, is the subject of the comment. The mention of "given up on the game and wants to just run out the clock to prevent more injuries" is indicative of a strategy that a head coach might employ when a game seems unwinnable. Therefore, "Shanahan" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers specifically to a key individual of the in-group team.	1665949170.0	49ers	falcons	476	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	8.0	0.03449418768286705	0.9227753822030577

The excitement ('LOVE') is more consistent with a positive reaction towards the in-group's performance. Although there is no explicit mention of the in-group team or players, the sentiment indicates support. Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged [IN], and '[SENT]' should be tagged as referring to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing enjoyment about a specific play, which in this context likely implies a positive play made by the in-group team. Even though 'LOVE the run up the middle on 2nd and 20' does not contain explicit mention of any team or player, it implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Saints, especially since commenters often describe their own team's plays with enthusiasm and positive emotions. The low win probability also suggests that the in-group needs positive plays like these to improve their chances, making it more likely the commenter is focusing on their own team when praising a play. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to reflect the implicit reference to the in-group.	1638502207.0	saints	cowboys	477	Brees	2.0	0.205488219857216	0.6689082969432314

The Bills, the commenter's in-group, would not be referred to in this disparaging manner by a supporter. The record of 4-6 suggests underperformance, which is more likely associated with the out-group in this context. Therefore, "these guys" should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to the out-group, Lions.	EXPLANATION: The comment is pointing out and criticizing the behavior of a team at 4-6, which is reflective of the out-group team, the Lions since the commenter supports the Bills. With a high win probability for the Bills, the commenter is complaining about the Lions' attitude despite their poor season record. Consequently, 'these guys' refers to the out-group, and should be tagged [OUT] since they refer to the team the commenter views negatively, which aligns with the opposition team, the Lions.	1669312176.0	bills	lions	478		3.0	0.704402357339859	0.07338737495688169

The information is related to an injury sustained by a player the commenter supports, which indicates concern and interest typically directed towards in-group players. Therefore, "Ward" should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter discusses a tweet about Ward suffering from a back injury. Given the low win probability of 0.0%, the in-group (Eagles) is doing poorly in the game, which matches the context of the parent comment criticizing the Eagles' coaching decisions. As Ward is likely an Eagles player, and the comment on his injury fits the context of the dire situation for the in-group, 'Ward' should be tagged with [IN] to reflect that he is part of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1642365530.0	eagles	buccaneers	479	:helmet: Season can't start soon enough	1.0	2.8252601623979245e-05	0.8173788919618163
train	ybmrzv	ithvnc2	t3_ybmrzv	[IN] Fucking absolutely ridiculous 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses frustration, which is more commonly directed towards the in-group team (the Ravens) since fans are typically more critical of their own team. There are no explicit words referring to the in-group team, but the sentiment suggests disappointment with the in-group's performance, so the sentence is tagged [IN] with '[SENT]' tagged as the referring expression.	EXPLANATION: The high win probability for the in-group Ravens suggests they are doing well in the game. Despite this, the comment 'Fucking absolutely ridiculous' is likely a visceral reaction to an event that just occurred, reflecting typical fan frustrations or exclamations during live games. Since the comment has no explicit reference to either team and is a broad expression of frustration, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is reacting to something involving their own team. Therefore, the implicit reference here is about the in-group, and '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	1666553847.0	ravens	browns	26		3.0	0.897266983985901	0.886463298379409

[SENT] lul 	['Jimmy', 'We']	[(9, 14), (133, 135)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 In the context of NFL sports comments, the use of the pronoun "we" generally indicates the in-group, which in this case is the 49ers. The commenter is expressing dissatisfaction with a missed scoring opportunity, something they'd only express if talking about their own team. Hence, "We" should clearly be tagged [IN]. The parent comment refers to specific players and events in the game. "Jimmy" refers to Jimmy Garoppolo, the quarterback for the 49ers, and should be tagged [IN] because he is a member of the in-group team that the commenter supports.  The rest of the comment doesn't mention entities explicitly but is implicitly about the 49ers since the commenter is discussing missed opportunities and the impact of a particular interception (INT) on the game. Fans typically reflect on such details while supporting their own team, further implying it's about the in-group. Therefore, the SENT tokens without explicit references don't need extra tagging but are part of the overall context supporting the tagging of "Jimmy" and "We" as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is addressing a player's performance and a specific play from the perspective of a 49ers fan. "Jimmy" refers to Jimmy Garoppolo, the quarterback for the 49ers, making it an in-group reference. The phrase "We should have gotten points there" implicitly refers to the in-group, as fans often use "we" to refer to their own team. The context provided by the extremely low win probability suggests the commenter is lamenting missed opportunities by the in-group team. Therefore, "Jimmy" and "We" are correctly tagged as [IN].	1666567384.0	49ers	chiefs	480	:classicfont: 49ers	-1.0	0.0003293746267445	0.9554473304473304

['Jags']	[(28, 32)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is supporting the Jaguars, which is evident from the use of "Jags" to refer to the Jaguars. By giving a shout-out to fellow Jaguars fans, the commenter is implicitly aligning themselves with the in-group. Therefore, "Jags" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is acknowledging the presence of the fans of the in-group team (Jaguars) at the game and expressing empathy towards them. Given the very low win probability, it indicates the Jaguars are likely losing, which justifies the comment about understanding how the fans feel. 'Jags' is a shortened form of Jaguars and refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Jags' is tagged with [IN]. The second sentence implicitly refers to the in-group fans, hence the sentence is indirectly about the in-group, but it doesn’t include an explicit expression that needs tagging.	1637522048.0	jaguars	49ers	482		7.0	0.033772349357605	0.4358114970546415

'They' in the first sentence refers to the Steelers' team executing the flippy catches. 'claypool' is a player for the Steelers, thus both "They" and "claypool" should be tagged as [OUT]. The second sentence is implicitly referring to the out-group team as it humorously suggests that these actions will create a funny montage, which is something that the commenter would likely mention if they were talking about an out-group team rather than their own. Thus, '[SENT]' in the second sentence should be tagged with [OUT], acknowledging that the topic of the montage would involve the out-group actions.	EXPLANATION: The high win probability for the in-group Chiefs suggests they are performing well, and the comment seems to be about the opponent Steelers. 'They' referring to the team executing flippy catches, and 'claypool', who is a well-known player on the Steelers, both refer to the out-group. The second sentence implies the same context without explicitly mentioning an entity, and hence '[SENT]' is tagged [OUT] as it continues to refer to the out-group's actions.	1640557182.0	chiefs	steelers	483		3.0	0.960448388010263	0.30544600938967137

Since the commenter supports the Cardinals, Conner is part of the in-group. The expressed desire to give the ball to Conner to achieve a first down suggests that the comment is from a supporter wanting success for their own team. Thus, 'Conner' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team (the Cardinals).	EXPLANATION: The commenter is suggesting a strategy involving giving the ball to Conner, who is a player for the Cardinals (the in-group). The win probability is very low, indicating the Cardinals are likely losing, which aligns with the context of the comment discussing a potentially positive play by an in-group player. Therefore, 'Conner' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1642473299.0	cardinals	rams	484		2.0	0.038358408957720025	0.4114737883283877

In this context, "They" is most likely referring to the in-group team (Raiders) since the comment discusses decisions about player usage, which fans typically direct towards their own team. Jackson is a player on the in-group Raiders team as implied by the discussion in the parent comment about the team's strategy. Hence, "Jackson" refers to an in-group player and "he" is also referring to Jackson. Therefore, 'They', 'Jackson', and 'he' should all be tagged as [IN] since they refer to entities related to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment indicates frustration with the way Jackson is being utilized, making it apparent that the commenter is referring to their own team, the Raiders. The word 'They' in this context refers to the Raiders' coaching staff or organization. 'Jackson' is a player on the Raiders, and 'he' also refers to Jackson. Although the win probability is relatively low, indicating that the in-group is likely losing, the focus of the comment is more on team management decisions rather than the immediate gameplay situation. Therefore, all these references ('They', 'Jackson', 'he') should be tagged with [IN], as they refer to the in-group team and its player.	1640048191.0	raiders	browns	485		1.0	0.39177647233009305	0.9720063664450894

Since the commenter is a 49ers fan and the overall tone of the comment could apply to either a positive or negative perspective about their own team, 'this team' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the 49ers.	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 40.9% suggests that the game is relatively close and not definitively favoring the in-group, which is the 49ers. 'this team' in the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group team (49ers) because fans typically refer to their own team as "this team" especially when the match is emotionally turbulent for them. Therefore, 'this team' should be tagged [IN] as it denotes the in-group team the commenter supports, the 49ers.	1641770039.0	49ers	rams	486	:jerseyhome85: George Kittle	5.0	0.409490048885345	0.5671368861024033

Therefore, "McKinnon" should be tagged as [IN]. Similarly, "he" refers to McKinnon and should also be tagged as [IN] as it is a pronoun referring to the same in-group player. Additionally, "Brown" appears to be another player for the Chiefs, in this context given it is suggested to perform certain plays more if they are good at it. Thus, "Brown" is also tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: McKinnon and Brown are players on the in-group team, the Chiefs. The commenter is expressing satisfaction about McKinnon, who contributed to their strong running game the previous year, and is happy to see him back, hence 'McKinnon' and 'he' should be tagged [IN]. The comment then moves on to Brown, discussing his skills in blocking, indicating that Brown is also a player on the in-group team. Thus, 'McKinnon', 'he', and 'Brown' are correctly tagged as [IN] since they refer to members of the in-group (Chiefs) team. Despite the win probability being relatively low, the comment focuses positively on in-group players.	1665451518.0	chiefs	raiders	489	Pat "Kermit" Mahomes	6.0	0.395639896392822	0.3722705485531688

The specific mention of 'Ryan Tannehill', who is the quarterback for the Titans, refers to an out-group player. Since Tannehill is the only named entity and he belongs to the out-group team, he should be tagged with [OUT]. The rest of the comment does not contain other explicit references to entities, but the dissatisfaction is clearly about how the in-group team is playing, hence no further tagging is required.	Given the context, the comment demonstrates frustration with the defensive strategy employed by the in-group team (Packers) against the out-group team's quarterback (Ryan Tannehill from the Titans). The win probability is relatively low for the Packers, suggesting they are not doing well, which aligns with the critical tone of the comment. The specific mention of Ryan Tannehill is crucial, as it points to an out-group player. Therefore, "Ryan Tannehill" should be tagged as [OUT] since he is a player for the opposing team, the Titans.  EXPLANATION: The comment is critical of the defensive approach of the in-group team, the Packers, particularly their strategy against Ryan Tannehill, who is the quarterback for the out-group team, the Titans. Since the in-group team (Packers) is not doing well at a 24.6% win probability, the frustration is understandable. The phrase "against Ryan Tannehill" directly refers to the out-group player, thus it should be tagged as [OUT].	1668738735.0	packers	titans	490		14.0	0.245930016040802	0.4240919540229885

The rest of the comment is a plea from the in-group fans requesting the Colts (other team) to defeat the out-group (Patriots) and silence their fanbase, which doesn't contain explicit mentions of either in-group or out-group so no additional tagging is necessary.	EXPLANATION: The term 'Colts' refers to another team in the NFL that is neither the in-group (Bills) nor the out-group (Patriots), hence should be tagged [OTHER]. The comment is implicitly asking for the in-group (Bills) to defeat the out-group (Patriots) and criticize their fanbase, but no explicit references to the in-group or out-group are made within the sentences. Therefore, 'Colts' fans should be tagged with [OTHER]. The rest of the comment doesn't have explicit words/phrases referring to in-group or out-group, thus no additional tags are necessary.	1640542019.0	bills	patriots	492	:IND:	5.0	0.560490548610687	0.023058252427184466
train	rui1fq	hqzriik	t3_rui1fq	[SENT] The guys in the stands behind me started a [OUT] chant 😂 	['Jimmy']	[(50, 55)]	['[OUT]']	[3]	 The in-group team here is the 49ers and the out-group team is the Texans. The name "Jimmy" refers to Jimmy Garoppolo, who is a quarterback for the 49ers, making it relevant to the in-group. Since the comment mentions "Jimmy" with a positive connotation (indicated by the laughter emoji), it suggests fan support for the in-group (49ers). Therefore, "Jimmy" should be tagged with [IN] instead of [OUT]. The correct tagging should be reconsidered as the comment refers to fans chanting for one of their own players, indicating in-group support.	Jimmy Garoppolo is a player for the 49ers, the in-group team. However, the context here implies that "Jimmy chant" is likely celebratory or supportive, which would typically come from the in-group fans, not the opponents. Since Jimmy is a quarterback for the 49ers, the commentary is inherently positive or at least focused on the in-group. Thus, "Jimmy" should be tagged as [IN] rather than [OUT], reflecting the in-group association. The target and the referring expressions need to be corrected to accurately represent this relationship.  Corrected TAGGED COMMENT: [SENT] The guys in the stands behind me started a [IN] chant 😂 Corrected REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['Jimmy']  EXPLANATION: The comment refers to fans of the 49ers (the in-group) starting a chant for Jimmy Garoppolo. Given his position in the team, the chant is likely done by 49ers supporters, therefore "Jimmy" should be tagged [IN] reflecting his status as a 49ers player. The initial tagging as [OUT] was incorrect; it should be corrected to [IN] since Garoppolo is associated with the in-group team.	1641162577.0	49ers	texans	493	:jerseyhome13: Brock Purdy	11.0	0.692940533161163	0.47526902020011325

The name "Shoukda" appears to be a typo or a nickname for an in-group player. Since the comment implies dissatisfaction related to the in-group player not making the play, the sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group team. Therefore, the entire sentence "[SENT]" should be tagged with [IN] even though there is no explicit word/phrase directly indicating the in-group, because the context suggests it.	EXPLANATION: The overall context provided includes a high win probability for the Falcons and the structure of the comment implies a critique or lamentation about a missed opportunity. Even though 'Shoukda' appears to be a misspelling or a typo for "should have," it seems like the commenter is reflecting on a play that the in-group, Falcons, failed to capitalize on. Since there is no explicit mention of either team or players, '[SENT]' is tagged [IN] because, given the high win probability, the focus is on something the in-group should have achieved, indicating frustration with their own team. This implicit reference to the in-group makes '[SENT]' the appropriate tag.	1633290633.0	falcons	commanders	494	My Man Matty Mahomes	1.0	0.77197676897049	0.8383577614923384

The use of 'they' in both sentences is likely referring to the in-group team (Cowboys) because fans typically discuss their own team's performance and prospects in this manner. The concern over needing a win and mentioning the #1 seed suggests a vested interest in the in-group's success, which is indicative of the commenter being a fan of the Cowboys. Thus, 'they' in both instances should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is concerned about their team's performance, evident from the low win probability of 9.5%. The sentence "If this game keeps trending in the loss direction they have to absolutely have to get the W on thanksgiving" is discussing the in-group team needing a win if they lose this game. Given that the in-group is the Cowboys, the word 'they' in this context is referring to the Cowboys. Similarly, the second sentence "I still feel like #1 seed is a pipe dream unless they actually pull this game out" speaks about the prospects of the in-group team achieving the top seed, contingent on winning the current game. The 'they' in this sentence also refers to the in-group team. Therefore, both instances of 'they' should be tagged as [IN], since they refer to the Cowboys. There are no explicit mentions of the opponent or other teams, so no other tags are needed.	1637533486.0	cowboys	chiefs	496	Connor Williams	2.0	0.09530705213546797	0.32861242247523836

['This team']	[(20, 29)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment refers to "Quinn and Patricia," who are associated with the Lions, indicating the commenter is talking about the in-group team (Lions). "This team" refers to the Lions, as indicated by the historical reference to 1963, which matches the Lions' long history of struggles. Thus, "This team" should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The comment reflects a critique of the in-group team, the Lions, by the commenter. The phrases "This team" is referring to the in-group without specifying them by name because the low win probability indicates they are not performing well, likely making the commenter critical and reflective about their long-term performance issues. Quinn and Patricia are presumably the coaches or management associated with the Lions, which the critic blames for ongoing failures. Therefore, "This team" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.  EXPLANATION: The commenter points out historical failures and current blame on Quinn and Patricia. Given the poor win probability, the comment reflects a disgruntled Lions fan criticizing their team, making "This team" refer to the in-group. Thus, "This team" should be tagged [IN].	1635705357.0	lions	eagles	497		1.0	0.0314590334892273	0.5517821782178218

The enthusiasm expressed in the comment ("LETS GOO") further indicates that it is a cheer for the in-group team. There are no other entities mentioned that need tagging, so "FLIGHT FORCE" is correctly tagged as [IN].	The phrase "LETS GOO FLIGHT FORCE" indicates support and excitement for a team, and "FLIGHT FORCE" is a nickname commonly associated with the in-group team, the Jets. Despite the low win probability, which means the Jets are likely losing, the enthusiasm expressed suggests strong support for the in-group. Therefore, "FLIGHT FORCE" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team.	1637517788.0	jets	dolphins	46	:OtherJoeDStoneCold: Stone Cold Joe Douglas	2.0	0.374773800373077	0.0024427757169999094

Crowder refers to a player, and given the context of the commenter supporting the Giants and the overall tone of the comment being critical, it's highly likely that "Crowder" is a player on the Giants team (the in-group). Therefore, "Crowder" should be tagged with [IN] since the complaint is about an in-group (Giants) player making a mistake.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Giants, and the out-group team is the Eagles. The win probability at 0.7% indicates the Giants are performing poorly. 'Crowder' refers to Tae Crowder, a player for the Giants. Since the comment criticizes Crowder for giving up a touchdown, 'Crowder' should be tagged with [IN] because he is a member of the in-group team.	1670789458.0	giants	eagles	498		3.0	0.007435643570362	0.7174946406934477

['we', 'white']	[(15, 17), (29, 34)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing frustration about a draft decision, which usually comes from a fan or supporter of the team making that decision. The word 'we' indicates that the commenter is talking about their own team, the Raiders, thus it should be tagged [IN]. Additionally, 'white' is likely referring to a player who was drafted by the Raiders, thus it should also be tagged [IN]. The second sentence contains no clear reference, but the overall context still centers around the in-group, so no additional tagging is necessary.	EXPLANATION: The comment is a criticism of the in-group team's drafting choices and player utilization. 'we' typically refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, in this case, the Raiders. The word 'white' likely references a drafted player of the Raiders that the commenter is questioning. Even though the Raiders have a high win probability, fans often discuss players and decisions critically regardless of current standing. Thus 'we' and 'white' should both be tagged [IN], referring to the in-group team and their drafted player respectively. The second sentence '6 Carrie’s ??' does not have an explicit in-group or out-group reference, hence it is not tagged.	1667764675.0	raiders	jaguars	499		13.0	0.7288492918014531	0.6204857066045345

Fans typically use "we" to refer to their own team, especially when discussing the game in progress or outcomes favorable to their interests. Therefore, "we" should be tagged [IN] as it denotes the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The word 'we' in the context of a sports comment typically refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. Here, the commenter is expressing relief or acceptance of being tied in the game, which is an indicator of a supportive stance towards the in-group team. Given the 75.9% win probability, the in-group (49ers) are doing well, and the comment reflects a positive outlook on the current game situation. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the 49ers.	1639950107.0	49ers	falcons	476	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	16.0	0.759366512298584	0.21124560718469348

The first sentence refers to sticking with Sidney Jones, which indicates a positive sentiment towards the in-group player despite any frustration. Therefore, 'Sidney Jones' should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, the pronoun "He" and "he" refer back to Sidney Jones and should also be tagged as [IN], reinforcing that the commenter is talking about an in-group player who they believe will improve with more play time.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing support for Sidney Jones, a player on the Seahawks, despite the frustrating situation implied in the first sentence. The win probability for the in-group is quite high, indicating that the Seahawks are likely doing well overall. The phrase "I’m still sticking with" and the positive comments about showing promise and improvement with playtime suggest that Sidney Jones is being defended and will continue to be supported. Thus, 'Sidney Jones' should be tagged [IN] as he is a player on the in-group team. 'He' and 'he' in the second sentence refer back to Sidney Jones, thus they should also be tagged [IN] for the same reason.	1633299561.0	seahawks	49ers	502		36.0	0.83781236410141	0.7113274336283186

Given that there is no explicit reference to either team, the frustration is likely regarding a poor performance or unexpected play by the in-group, which is the Patriots in this case. The absence of explicit qualifier implies the in-group team, therefore the whole sentence should be tagged with [IN]. 'WTAF did I just watch' implicitly refers to an in-group disappointing moment. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] since the overall sentiment appears directed at the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the Patriots is relatively high, indicating they are doing well in the game overall. However, the exclamation "WTAF did I just watch" suggests the commenter is referring to a confusing or surprising play that just occurred. Given that the comment is not qualified and it is common for fans to use an exclamation like this when reacting to their own team's plays, it is reasonable to infer that this comment is about the in-group, the Patriots. Hence, the entire sentence should be tagged with [IN] since there is no explicit reference but it implicitly refers to the in-group.	1668977786.0	patriots	jets	503		2.0	0.580494701862335	0.9290773532152843

train	xbnaya	io0fpg5	t3_xbnaya	[IN] Horrible decision making 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment 'Horrible decision making' is critical, and such criticism without further context or detail is generally directed at the in-group team. Fans typically express frustration with their own team’s decision-making when things are not going well. Since the commenter is an Eagles fan, it's reasonable to conclude that the criticism is aimed at the Eagles. Since there is no explicit word or phrase mentioning the in-group, the entire sentence is tagged with '[IN]'. This reflects the implicit reference to the in-group team in the critical statement.	EXPLANATION: The comment "Horrible decision making" is most likely referring to the in-group team, as fans often critique their own team's decisions and plays in real-time. The in-group team is the Eagles, and the win probability of 60.1% suggests the game is relatively close, leaving room for criticism of their performance. Since there is no explicit mention of either team, the entire sentence is tagged as [IN] by default because fans are typically referring to their own team's actions when making such remarks. Hence, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN].	1662917035.0	eagles	lions	506	My Cox Ertz Wentz in awhile	3.0	0.600744366645813	0.10082023239917977

['JT']	[(17, 19)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 'JT' likely refers to Jonathan Taylor, a player for the Colts. The comment suggests a strategy change for the Colts, indicating the commenter has an interest in the performance of the in-group team. Therefore, 'JT' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a member of the in-group team. The rest of the sentences are general statements without specific referring expressions, thus they remain untagged.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is suggesting a strategy to use JT (Jonathan Taylor) more, which implies they are discussing the in-group team, as fans typically focus on strategies for their own team. Jonathan Taylor is a well-known player for the Colts, the in-group team. Despite the high win probability, the commenter is likely thinking about optimizing performance or future plays. Hence, 'JT' should be tagged with [IN]. The rest of the sentences lack explicit references to any team or players but are part of the broader context of discussing in-group strategies. Therefore, '[SENT]' is appropriately tagged with '[IN]' only in the first sentence due to the explicit mention of JT.	1634497616.0	colts	texans	508		8.0	0.986475834549146	0.7045218540545644

train	zu9dbq	j1ir53i	t3_zu9dbq	[IN] Let ’s go baby 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment "Let’s go baby" is a cheer that fans typically use to motivate and show enthusiasm for their own team. Since the comment does not contain any explicit referring expressions to players, teams, or other entities, the overall sentiment and context indicate that this is supportive language for the in-group team, the Lions. Therefore, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN] because the commenter is implicitly referring to the in-group team they support.	EXPLANATION: The phrase "Let’s go baby" is a common expression of encouragement and excitement typically directed toward the team the commenter supports. This comment does not contain a specific reference to the in-group team or the out-group team, but given the positive tone and the fact that the win probability for the in-group (Lions) is greater than 50%, it suggests that the commenter is cheering for the in-group. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to reflect the implicit support for the Lions.	1671905851.0	lions	panthers	510		3.0	0.574147081936382	0.08037163990618798

['Giants', 'the Bears']	[(7, 13), (36, 45)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment discusses the talent comparison between the Giants and the Bears. The mention of "Giants" should be tagged as [OUT] since they are the out-group opponent team. The reference to "the Bears" should be tagged as [IN] because that is the team the commenter supports. The rest of the sentence is expressing an opinion on this comparison and does not refer to specific entities, thus it does not need tagging. "That's sad" is a follow-up reaction to the talent comparison, emphasizing the previous statement without introducing new entities.	The commenter is a supporter of the Bears, which is the in-group team. 'Giants' in the first sentence refers to the out-group team, as they are the opponent. 'the Bears' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, as indicated by the win probability and the context of the comparison being made about talent. The second sentence, 'That's sad,' is a reflection on the comparative statement made in the first sentence, hence it does not refer to any specific entity and remains untagged. Therefore, 'Giants' should be tagged [OUT] and 'the Bears' should be tagged [IN].	1664739768.0	bears	giants	26		4.0	0.12996697425842296	0.9003004130679685

In this context, the person is expressing happiness about something that their group is experiencing ('finally see little play'). Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports (Jaguars).	EXPLANATION: 'we' here refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. Given that the in-group in this context is the Jaguars, the commenter is expressing relief or satisfaction about something related to their team. The low win probability suggests that the in-group team is not doing well overall, so the commenter might be looking for silver linings or positive developments happening for their team. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] as it denotes the in-group (Jaguars) in this comment.	1636308329.0	jaguars	bills	514	:Tebow:	1.0	0.117986313998699	0.015852047556142668

Since the Ravens are the in-group team the commenter supports, and there is no explicit reference to a specific team, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is a plea for a crucial defensive stop on a third down, which is usually directed at the in-group team the commenter supports. Given that the win probability is relatively low for the Ravens, the commenter is urging their team (Ravens, the in-group) to make an important play to potentially change the game's momentum. As there is no explicit mention of the team, the '[SENT]' token should be tagged [IN] since the implicit plea is directed towards the in-group team.	1632104319.0	ravens	chiefs	516		2.0	0.244039654731751	0.6462110646211064

['they']	[(15, 19)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment is a rhetorical question likely meant to reference the opponent, indicating frustration or sarcasm about their success ('in the Super Bowl again'). Given the context of the parent comment, which mentions the out-group team (Eagles) destroying the in-group team (Chiefs), 'they' in this comment refers to the out-group team. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged as [OUT] correctly.	EXPLANATION: In the context of the comment, "they" refers to the team that is currently performing well and is being referenced as the cause of the in-group's poor performance. Given that the out-group is the Eagles and the in-group is the Chiefs, and considering the low win probability for the Chiefs (22.5%), it's clear that the commenter is talking about the Eagles' success. Thus, "they" should be tagged as [OUT] because it refers to the out-group, the Eagles, who are presumably heading to the Super Bowl again.	1676250423.0	chiefs	eagles	517	Chiefs	1.0	0.22457957267761197	0.3960576314122863

['BOYS']	[(19, 23)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 When the commenter uses the phrase "GET IN HERE BOYS !!!," they are likely addressing members of the in-group or fans of the in-group team, as the term "boys" often refers to teammates or people associated with one's own side. Since the comment does not mention any specific players or teams, the term "BOYS" is inferred to be referring to the in-group supporters or players, hence it is tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'GET IN HERE BOYS !!!' is a call to action that is likely directed towards the in-group team. 'BOYS' is a common term used by fans to refer to their own team or players in an informal and encouraging manner. Given that the win probability is relatively low for the Ravens, this call could be an attempt by the commenter to rally their team, showing support and urging them to improve their performance. Therefore, 'BOYS' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group, the Ravens, the team the commenter supports.	1673838981.0	ravens	bengals	520		1.0	0.328010061772365	0.6644615950018375

['you', 'him']	[(19, 22), (29, 32)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The question suggests frustration directed at the in-group team (Dolphins) for stopping the clock, which implies an unwanted action during a critical moment. 'you' refers to an assumed player from the in-group who made the error, and 'him' likely refers to an out-group player (Jaguars) who was touched. Therefore, 'you' should be tagged [IN], and 'him' should be tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the in-group (Dolphins) is 100%, indicating that the game is virtually won, and the comment seems to be critiquing a specific play. Using "you" in the comment typically suggests that the commenter is addressing a player from the in-group, as fans often speak directly to their own team's players, especially in a critical tone. "Him," on the other hand, refers to a player from the out-group (Jaguars), as touching an opponent and stopping the clock would likely be perceived as a mistake if it benefits the opponent. Thus, "you" should be tagged as [IN] and "him" as [OUT], reflecting the in-group and out-group references respectively.	1634489826.0	dolphins	jaguars	521		2.0	1.0	1.0
train	pkvlxh	hc91y56	t3_pkvlxh	[SENT] Ca n’t do that against [OUT] this good 	['an offense']	[(30, 40)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment is remarking on the quality of the opponent's offense. Since the comment attributes a high level of skill or effectiveness to the offense and does not specify an "our" offense, it is reasonable to assume that "an offense" refers to the out-group team. Since the qualifier "this good" implies recognition of the opponent's strong performance, "an offense" should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the opponent team, Buccaneers.	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 22.4% suggests that the in-group team (Cowboys) is likely trailing in the game. The comment criticizes allowing the opponent's offensive plays. The phrase "an offense this good" suggests respect or acknowledgment of strong offensive performance, which implies it refers to the out-group team, the Buccaneers, given the context. Hence, "an offense" should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the opponent's team (Buccaneers) who likely have the strong offense being mentioned.	1631234143.0	cowboys	buccaneers	522		3.0	0.224311262369156	0.05446916316997862

This type of internal criticism is typically directed towards the in-group team by their own supporters. Therefore, "this team" is referring to the in-group, the Packers, who the commenter supports. Hence it should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is talking about the management of a team, and considering that the in-group team is the Packers and the out-group is the Lions, it is reasonable to infer that 'this team' refers to the in-group Packers. 'Gute' likely refers to Brian Gutekunst, the general manager of the Packers, and the commenter seems to be making a remark about the team under his management, despite the relatively high win probability. Hence, 'this team' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group, the Packers.	1632183818.0	packers	lions	523		1.0	0.686003760014238	0.04883388862446454

train	xtsbdg	iqsmoul	t3_xtsbdg	[SENT] [IN] HAS FUCKING GUTS WHAT A DRIVE 	['ZW']	[(7, 9)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is expressing admiration for a player named 'ZW'. Given the in-group team is the Jets and Zach Wilson, whose initials are 'ZW', is their quarterback, it is reasonable to infer that this comment is about an in-group player. The exclamation and positive tone ('HAS FUCKING GUTS WHAT A DRIVE') further suggest this is praise for a performance, which fans typically direct towards their own team's players. Therefore, 'ZW' should be tagged with [IN].	The commenter is referring to 'ZW,' who is Zach Wilson, a quarterback for the New York Jets, which is the in-group team. The expression 'WHAT A DRIVE' indicates that 'ZW' has executed a successful drive, which aligns with the high win probability of 90.3%, suggesting that the Jets are performing well. 'ZW' is the only explicit mention, and since he is a member of the in-group, it should be tagged [IN]. Thus '[SENT]' captures Zach Wilson's commendable play, indicative of his role on the in-group team.  EXPLANATION: 'ZW' refers to Zach Wilson, a quarterback for the New York Jets (in-group team), signifying a commendable action ('WHAT A DRIVE'). The high win probability suggests that the Jets are doing well, aligning with the celebratory tone of the comment. Hence, 'ZW' should be tagged as [IN].	1664741395.0	jets	steelers	525	:PlayerWescoTE1: Wesco FB1	7.0	0.9034950893641841	0.9809872667015525

The pronoun "they" continues to refer to "this defense," reinforcing the in-group context. Finally, "we" clearly indicates the commenter is talking about their own team, thus also referring to the in-group. Therefore, "this defense," "they," and "we" should all be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing sympathy for the defense, which is likely referring to the in-group team, the Packers, without specifying them by name—thus 'this defense' should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence continues to focus on the same defense needing to make a stop and get the ball back, indicating that 'they' refers to the in-group defense. Finally, 'we' implies a collective identification with the in-group team, suggesting that the commenter is a Packers supporter who believes their team will have a small chance if the defense makes a necessary stop. Therefore, 'we' should also be tagged as [IN].	1642910172.0	packers	49ers	26		3.0	0.382194817066193	0.9294754130035745

The phrase 'the lions' clearly refers to the in-group team, so it should be tagged as [IN]. Additionally, the repeated use of 'we' throughout the comment indicates in-group references, as fans typically use 'we' to refer to their own team. Therefore, 'we' should also be tagged as [IN] in all instances.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing concern about the performance of their team, the Lions, in the second half of games. The win probability is relatively low, indicating that the in-group team is currently not in a strong position. The phrase "the lions" explicitly refers to the in-group team and should be tagged [IN]. The use of "we" throughout the comment also indicates affiliation with the in-group team, as fans typically use "we" to refer to their own team. Therefore, the phrases 'the lions' and all instances of 'we' are correctly tagged [IN]. This demonstrates that the commenter is focused on the in-group's challenges, consistent with being a fan of the Lions.	1664130878.0	lions	vikings	526		1.0	0.30976074934005704	0.476219196967086

'Defense' in this context is therefore tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, 'We' clearly refers to the commenter's own team, as it expresses frustration with their inability to get a first down. 'We' is tagged [IN] as it signifies the in-group. In the third sentence, 'They' refers back to the in-group team, indicating that 'they' (the Falcons) are making mistakes, putting the defense back on the field frequently. Hence, 'They' is tagged [IN].  The phrase 'the defense' in the same sentence also refers to the in-group defense being put back on the field, so it should be tagged [IN] as well.	EXPLANATION: Despite the win probability being close to even, the language of the comment indicates frustration with the performace of the in-group team, the Falcons. 'Defense' is introduced in the first sentence without clarification, suggesting it refers to the in-group defense. The use of 'We' in the second sentence further indicates this frustration, which is typically an in-group reference. 'They' and 'the defense' in the third sentence can be seen as additional references to the in-group team, as the commenter is criticizing their own team's repeated mistakes. Thus, all tagged expressions refer to the in-group.	1667761426.0	falcons	chargers	527		1.0	0.479539394378662	0.35102935569958066

['Bills', 'McDermott']	[(18, 23), (46, 55)]	['[OUT]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter explicitly mentions the Bills, which is the out-group team, by stating "If I was a Bills fan". This indicates that they are talking about the out-group team in this context. Therefore, "Bills" should be tagged as [OUT]. Additionally, McDermott is associated with the Bills as their head coach, so "McDermott" should also be tagged as [OUT]. The second sentence does not have explicit mention of either team, but it is a continuation of the discussion about the Bills' decision-making, specifically referring to the punt, which is still implicitly about the out-group team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter expresses hypothetical distress if they were a fan of the Bills due to McDermott's decision making. Since this comment indicates what they would do if they were supporting the opponent (Bills), both "Bills" and "McDermott" (the Bills' coach) are referring to the out-group and should be tagged with [OUT]. The high win probability for the in-group (Buccaneers) implies that the commenter is confident in their team's performance and thus directs criticism towards the out-group. The second sentence does not explicitly mention who made the punt, but it can be interpreted to refer to the out-group's actions (with 'That punt' stemming from McDermott's decision making). Thus, 'Bills' and 'McDermott' should be tagged [OUT].	1639352753.0	buccaneers	bills	528	:bucsoldship: 	2.0	0.954738318920135	0.6751102204408818

[SENT] Gonna be hard for [OUT] to kick a fg and gonna be hard for [IN] to punt without a touchback or a shank 	['[SENT]', 'them', 'us']	[(0, 6), (72, 76), (112, 114)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The first sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group (Chiefs), as the commenter is giving a strategy suggestion ('go for it') where they are presumably suggesting that the Chiefs should go for it on the 40 yard line due to windy conditions. Thus '[SENT]' in the first sentence should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, 'them' refers to the Packers and 'us' refers to the Chiefs, hence 'them' is tagged as [OUT] and 'us' is tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The first sentence implicitly refers to the in-group (Chiefs) since the commenter is suggesting their own team (implicitly "we") should "go for it" on 4th down considering the windy conditions. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN] as it implicitly refers to the in-group team. In the second sentence, "them" likely refers to the opposing team (Packers) and thus should be tagged [OUT] because it will be hard for the out-group to kick a field goal in this situation. "Us" explicitly refers to the commentator's own team (Chiefs) addressing the difficulty of punting, so it should be tagged [IN]. This comment reflects the strategy concerns faced by both teams due to the weather conditions, with mentions of the in-group and out-group challenges.	1636322330.0	chiefs	packers	90	Patrick Mahomes #2	5.0	0.893106281757355	0.17990275526742303
train	yvhapi	iweu48m	t3_yvhapi	[SENT] [IN] LOOKING LIKE A REAL NFL TEAM OMG 	['WERE']	[(7, 11)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The excitement and pride expressed in the comment suggest that the commenter is talking about the in-group team, the Commanders. The use of the pronoun "WERE" without any mention of the out-group indicates it is a self-referential statement, implying that the speaker is part of the team’s fanbase. Therefore, "WERE" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment is showing excitement and positivity about how the team is performing, which is something a fan would likely say about their own team. The use of 'WERE' (or 'WE're') indicates that the commenter is referring to their in-group team, the Commanders, even though the win probability is not particularly high. This kind of exclamation reflects hope or surprise at a moment of good performance, despite the overall challenging game situation. Therefore, 'WERE' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1668480252.0	commanders	eagles	529		12.0	0.406790971755981	0.5134406012139898

Since the Packers are the out-group team, 'the packers' should be tagged [OUT]. No other explicit references are made to either the in-group or other groups, and the sentiment is directed towards the out-group team having a disadvantage. Therefore, 'the packers' is correctly tagged with [OUT].	This comment discusses the Packers' quarterback's impressive statistics (37 touchdowns and 4 interceptions), and the commenter is humorously asking for the Packers to have a bad quarterback for a few seasons. Since the in-group team is the Lions and the out-group opponent is the Packers, 'the packers' refers to the out-group. The use of 'let' and 'just have one shitty qb for a few season' indicates a desire for misfortune for the competitive opponent, further solidifying that the Packers are considered the out-group in this context. Therefore, 'the packers' is tagged [OUT], and since the rest of the sentence doesn't explicitly reference the in-group (Lions), it isn't tagged.	1641755367.0	lions	packers	530	Welcome to Detroit!	7.0	0.487088054418564	0.37061322497229404

[SENT] But hey , at least it ’s because [IN] are playing such a tough defense 	['[SENT]', '[SENT]', 'we']	[(0, 6), (29, 35), (105, 107)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	The commenter is likely referring to the performance of the in-group team, the Broncos, since the mention of '6 first half points' appears to be a criticism. The reference to 'Pat Shurmur', who is associated with the Broncos, further supports this. The final sentence refers to 'we', which is an indicator of the in-group team the commenter supports.  The comment expresses dissatisfaction with the Broncos' offensive performance (6 first half points), mentions Pat Shurmur in a context that implies disappointment, and sarcastically attributes the low score to the toughness of the opposing defense. This sarcasm suggests that the commenter blames their own team rather than genuinely respecting the opponent's defense. Therefore, '[SENT]' for the first and second sentences should be tagged [IN] to reflect the in-group context. The word 'we' clearly refers to the commenter's own team, so it should be tagged [IN] as well. The overall context is about critiquing the in-group team and indirectly pointing at their struggles. Finally, the properly tagged target matches the reflective expressions referring to the in-group team, making the provided tags accurate.	EXPLANATION: The first and second sentences are likely about the in-group, Broncos, as indicated by the mention of '6 first half points' and 'Pat Shurmur,' who was a coach for the Broncos. This suggests underperformance on the part of the in-group, and the win probability being high supports that they aren't currently doing badly overall but might have had a slow start in the first half. Although Pat Shurmur is not explicitly tied in the text to the Broncos, the sarcastic tone paired with the in-group's points makes it clear to whom the comment refers. The last sentence, 'But hey, at least it’s because we are playing such a tough defense,' clearly uses 'we' to denote the in-group. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN]. There is no explicit reference to the out-group, so 'we' should be tagged [IN], and the '[SENT]' tokens for the first two sentences should be tagged [IN] as well since they implicitly refer to the in-group's performance.	1663538236.0	broncos	texans	532		7.0	0.735107153654099	0.4993173750796396

Therefore, 'we' is tagged with [IN] since it refers to the Rams, the team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'we' almost always refers to the in-group, which in this case is the Rams. Given that the win probability is low, it makes sense that the commenter is expressing frustration about their own team's performance this year. Thus, 'we' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	1668976513.0	rams	saints	533	Rams	4.0	0.05486637353897095	0.8766966163257504

['GB team']	[(38, 45)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is expressing a negative sentiment towards the overall entertainment value of the game, specifically naming "GB team," which is shorthand for the Green Bay Packers. Since the Packers are the in-group team that the commenter supports, "GB team" is tagged with [IN]. The mention of "Rodgers injury seasons" reinforces that it's a reflection on past Packers seasons, further indicating that the comment is about the in-group team. Therefore, "GB team" should be correctly tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is talking about the Green Bay Packers team, which is the in-group since the commenter supports the Packers. Despite the high win probability, the commenter finds the game boring, which matches the sentiment expressed in the parent comment. The phrase "GB team" refers to the Green Bay Packers and should be tagged [IN] since it represents the in-group. Since there's no other team mentioned, and the context clearly involves the in-group, the phrase correctly corresponds to the in-group.	1666550832.0	packers	commanders	534		2.0	0.796158686280251	0.5223396289208753

The use of the word "DESTROYED" suggests a tone of satisfaction or schadenfreude, indicating that the commenter is pleased with Wilson's failure, something expected if Wilson is from the opponent team. Therefore, 'Wilson' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to an out-group player.	EXPLANATION: In this comment, 'Wilson' refers to a player from the opposing team, the Jets, based on the context of the current game and the known teams involved. Given the high win probability for the Eagles (the in-group team), it suggests that the Eagles are performing well, and it is likely that 'Wilson' (a player from the out-group team) is struggling or was involved in a play where he was not successful. Therefore, 'Wilson' is tagged as [OUT] because he is a member of the opponent team.	1638731315.0	eagles	jets	536	You want Philly Philly?	6.0	0.8422194272279739	0.3563911127102636

Therefore, 'he' should be tagged with [IN]. 'Horne' refers to Jaycee Horn, a player for the Panthers, a team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group, thus should be tagged [OTHER]. The full comment refers to a comparison between an in-group player (Surtain) and a player from another team (Horn), justifying the tags.	EXPLANATION: The comment is a reply to a parent comment discussing Patrick Surtain, a player for the Broncos, which indicates that 'he' refers to Surtain and thus should be tagged [IN] since the Broncos are the in-group team. Jaycee Horne is a cornerback for the Panthers, but since the Panthers are the out-group team, he would likely be tagged as an [OUT] if directly referenced. However, considering the widespread context in the NFL and that both players are often compared against top-tier cornerbacks from other teams in general discussions, 'Horne' should be tagged as [OTHER] in this context. The low win probability suggests the Broncos are performing poorly in the game, which aligns with the potentially critical tone of the comment. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged [IN], and 'Horne' should be tagged [OTHER], as it points to an external comparison not specifically focused on the opponent team.	1669580550.0	broncos	panthers	537		1.0	0.04474806785583496	0.7523980277902286

Since the commenter supports the Bears and Kyler Gordon is a player for the Bears, this reference is about an in-group entity. The comment has no disparaging remarks about the oppositional team, indicating it is focused on critiquing their own team. Therefore, 'Kyler Gordon' should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: Kyler Gordon is a player for the Bears, which is the in-group for the commenter. Given that the comment specifically mentions Kyler Gordon and criticizes his performance, it is evident that the commenter is talking about a player from their own team. Additionally, the very low win probability indicates that the Bears are not performing well at this stage, reinforcing the idea that the commenter is focusing on an in-group player's lackluster performance. Therefore, 'Kyler Gordon' should be tagged as [IN].	1662922083.0	bears	49ers	538		3.0	0.0699769258499146	0.5781206431824519

In-group fans are more likely to internally criticize their own team's players, as seen here. Specifically, 'the qb' is likely referring to the quarterback of the Patriots who missed wide-open receivers, which the commenter is frustrated about. Similarly, 'receivers' in this context are wide-open players on the same team who were missed, indicating that both 'the qb' and 'receivers' should be tagged as [IN]. Thus, both these entities refer to the in-group team, the Patriots.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is defending the play calling by shifting blame to the quarterback and receivers for missing opportunities. Given that the win probability is relatively low for the Patriots, it suggests they are not performing well at the moment. Typically, fans will critique or defend specific players within their own team, so here, 'the qb' and 'receivers' logically refer to the in-group, the Patriots. Thus, 'the qb' and 'receivers' should be tagged with [IN].	1672603251.0	patriots	dolphins	26		1.0	0.301660150289536	0.624099771649394

The phrase 'make 'em pay' suggests that the commenter wants their team to take advantage of an opportunity, which is something fans would typically express towards their in-group team. Therefore, 'defense' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the Seahawks' defense.	EXPLANATION: The comment is encouraging the defense, which is typically not specified as belonging to a particular team but understood to be the in-group team by supporters. The win probability is relatively high, indicating the in-group team is doing well, which aligns with the encouraging tone of the comment. Therefore, "defense" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Seahawks.	1670196240.0	seahawks	rams	539	:HawkStar:	9.0	0.6678645610809331	0.7584602754720423

This level of detailed criticism is typically directed toward an in-group player that the commenter supports. Since the commenter supports the Lions (the in-group), Igwenuike must be a player from the Lions. Therefore, 'Igwenuike' should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: 'Igwenuike' refers to Godwin Igwebuike, a player for the Lions, which is the in-group team that the commenter supports. The comment criticizes Igwebuike for fumbling the ball, suggesting he should be removed from the team next year. Since the comment is disparaging a player from the in-group team, 'Igwenuike' should be tagged as [IN]. Despite the high win probability, fans often direct criticism at their own team’s players for mistakes in performance, which matches the sentiment expressed in the comment. Thus 'Igwenuike' is correctly tagged [IN].	1639943578.0	lions	cardinals	540	Welcome to Detroit!	3.0	0.823655068874359	0.6061740798246416

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The parent comment mentions that "we" (referring to the in-group team, the Patriots) were 8 point favorites, and the reply corrects this by stating "9." Since the context is about the point spread favoring the Patriots, the entire sentence implicitly references the in-group. Therefore, the sentence should be tagged with [IN] because it is speaking about the in-group team's status. The lack of explicit in-group references leads to tagging the whole sentence.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment is likely referring to the point spread favoring the in-group team, the Patriots. Given that the commenter states "9, actually," they are correcting or updating the information about how many points the Patriots were favored by. There are no explicit mentions of the team in the comment, but it implicitly refers to the in-group team's point spread. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the commenter is indirectly talking about the in-group team, the Patriots.	1633889071.0	patriots	texans	541		1.0	0.373346865177154	0.3476624964725802

The commenter is likely an Eagles supporter talking about turning the Steelers' defense ('the Steel Curtain') into a weak defense ('a Pickett fence'). Thus, "the Steel Curtain" should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group opponent team, the Steelers.	EXPLANATION: 'the Steel Curtain' refers to a famous and historically stout defense of the Pittsburgh Steelers, thus it should be tagged as [OUT] since the Steelers are the out-group team for the commenter. The win probability is quite high for the in-group (Eagles), indicating they are performing well, and the comment seems to be mocking the strength of the out-group's defense by comparing it to something flimsy ('Pickett fence'), which reinforces the tagging of 'the Steel Curtain' as [OUT].	1667152969.0	eagles	steelers	544		5.0	0.9214933142066	0.348658266807733

The first 'Titans' explicitly refers to the in-group team, and 'Titan' functions as a verb in this context, still referring to the in-group team. Therefore, both 'Titans' and 'Titan' are tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The phrase "Titans gonna Titan" expresses frustration or resignation about the performance of the Titans, indicating that it's typical behavior for them. This kind of expression is typically used by fans referring to their own team. The phrase "Lmao" at the start suggests humor or sarcasm in the commenter's tone, which aligns with a supporter more likely criticizing their own team. Consequently, "Titans" and "Titan" both refer to the in-group team, the Titans, and should be tagged [IN] respectively.	1639944567.0	titans	steelers	546		-1.0	0.667870694594844	0.6744865439093485

Therefore, 'Vikings' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The term 'us' refers to the Bears, which is the in-group team the commenter supports, so it should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter is talking about a game between the Bears (in-group) and the Giants (out-group), but the Vikings are mentioned, not as part of the current game, but as part of another game where they played against the Bears. The Bears supporters (in-group) feel like they got unlucky against the Vikings, who are another team in the NFL, making the Vikings [OTHER] in this context. 'us' refers to the in-group team (Bears), as the commenter is discussing their own experiences against different teams, including the Vikings.  Thus, 'Vikings' is tagged [OTHER] since it refers to a team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group for this specific game, and 'us' is tagged [IN] as it implicitly refers to the Bears, the in-group team.	1641147834.0	bears	giants	547		2.0	0.936305657029152	0.1212474497231128

This kind of language indicates that the commenter is addressing the opponent team, the Chargers. Therefore, "Chargers" should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the out-group opponent team.	EXPLANATION: While the win probability for the Patriots is high, indicating they are likely leading in the game, the comment is directed at the opponent, the Chargers. The use of the imperative "Shut the fuck up" clearly tells the opposing team, the Chargers, to be quiet, often implying frustration or annoyance at something the opponent has said or done. Therefore, "Chargers" is correctly tagged as [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team, the opponent.	1635720687.0	patriots	chargers	548		1.0	0.871127605438232	0.8871584942600338

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is recalling a specific moment involving Blake Bortles, a player who has played for the Jaguars. The context implies a nostalgic tone usually associated with the in-group team’s past events. Hence, this comment is about the in-group Jaguars, even though there are no explicit words referring to the Jaguars in the comment. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to indicate the comment is about the in-group.	Blake Bortles was a former quarterback for the Jaguars, the in-group team. The mention of '4th down with Bortles' is referencing a significant or memorable moment for fans of the Jaguars, since it assumes the audience has knowledge of this past event. Given the relatively low win probability, the commenter may be reflecting on past moments to ignite nostalgia or emphasize the pressures of the current situation. There isn't an explicit reference to the in-group, but the sentence is implicitly about the Jaguars. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the entire comment is centering on a historical moment relevant to the Jaguars and their supporters.	1636316779.0	jaguars	bills	551	Tony Boselli :TB71:	2.0	0.368711292743683	0.7600176133861735

Since the comment discusses the performance of a defense (a defensive touchdown), it is most likely referring to the in-group team (Raiders) rather than the opponent. The lack of explicit entities means that the whole sentence gets tagged as `[IN]` as it is implicitly referring to the in-group team. Thus, both sentences are tagged `[IN]`.	EXPLANATION: The win probability is relatively high for the in-group Raiders, indicating they are likely winning or performing well overall. However, the commenter reflects on the fact that it's been 3 years since a defensive touchdown (def td), which they find both shocking and unsurprising. Since there's no explicit mention of the Raiders or any other team, but the context implies the commenter is talking about their own team due to the personal investment expressed ("def td" likely stands for "defensive touchdown" which aligns with the performance of the Raiders' defense), the sentences are implicitly about the in-group Raiders. Therefore, the tokens '[SENT]' in both sentences are tagged as [IN] since the commenter is referring to their supported team.	1664746663.0	raiders	broncos	552	:87:	2.0	0.701314032077789	0.3833466347432828

['him', 'his QB']	[(16, 19), (45, 51)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment discusses the difficulty for a player to perform well due to the quarterback's lack of time to throw. This is more likely a concern for fans of the in-group team, who would be critical of their own offensive line's performance rather than the opponent's. Therefore, 'him' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player, and 'his QB' should also be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group quarterback.	EXPLANATION: With an extremely low win probability of 4.2%, it's clear the in-group team (Falcons) is struggling. The comment seems to be sympathizing with one of their own offensive players by stating how difficult it is for him to play well when his quarterback (QB) has no time to throw the ball. Since 'him' and 'his QB' both refer to players on the in-group team, they should be tagged with [IN]. The overall sentiment and focus is on the challenges faced by the Falcons, which supports the tagging of 'him' and 'his QB' as [IN].	1639954972.0	falcons	49ers	553		0.0	0.042069911956787	0.686157750878563

[IN] Playing way to scared right now 	['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (48, 54)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing a need for the team to be more aggressive and criticizing the current playing style, which indicates a vested interest and concern typical of an in-group supporter. The absence of explicit mentions of teams or players coupled with the tone of constructive criticism implies this is about the in-group. Therefore, the '[SENT]' tags are used to indicate that both sentences are implicitly referring to the in-group team, the Raiders.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is critiquing a conservative playing style, which is likely directed towards the in-group team given their need to improve the situation, as indicated by the fairly low win probability (34.0%). Fans typically provide such commentary about their own team when they believe there is something at stake or something that needs to be adjusted immediately. There are no explicit mentions of team names or players, but the context implies the commenter is talking about the Raiders, the in-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' tags for both sentences should be labeled as [IN] since they implicitly refer to the in-group team.	1638741664.0	raiders	commanders	555	:Logo_95-Present:	1.0	0.34027087688446	0.3072656683305602

['the Rams', 'LA']	[(12, 20), (30, 32)]	['[OUT]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing strong negative sentiment towards the Rams and LA, which suggests they are referring to the out-group team, as hate or frustration is usually directed at the opponent. 'the Rams' is a direct reference to the out-group team, and 'LA' refers to the city where the Rams are based, so both should be tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The Cardinals are playing against the Rams, which identifies the Rams as the out-group. The commenter expresses anger towards both 'the Rams' and 'LA', where LA is commonly known shorthand for Los Angeles, the home of the Rams. With a win probability of 49.6%, the game is fairly even, but regardless of the game state, such remarks typically reflect animosity towards the opponent team, reinforcing that both 'the Rams' and 'LA' refer to the out-group. Therefore, they should be tagged [OUT].	1639448583.0	cardinals	rams	556	:White5: Matt Prater	3.0	0.495891094207764	0.3742857142857143
test	pmz9d9	hcm72qm	t1_hcm6wxl	[SENT] Idk how got bold but # 1 pick [IN] 	['Toney']	[(37, 42)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment refers to Toney, who is Kadarius Toney, a player for the Giants, the commenter’s in-group team. The phrase "got bold" suggests that the commenter is reacting to a specific play or action by Toney, indicating a focus on the performance of an in-group player. Therefore, Toney should be tagged as [IN] because he plays for the in-group team (Giants). There are no other explicit references to in-group, out-group, or other entities in the comment.	EXPLANATION: The reference to '# 1 pick Toney' is about Kadarius Toney, a player who was a first-round draft pick for the Giants, which is the in-group team for the commenter. The win probability is low, indicating the Giants are likely not doing well, and the comment seems to be questioning a decision or play involving Toney, without further context needed to identify he is from the in-group. Hence, 'Toney' should be tagged with [IN] since he belongs to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1631483406.0	giants	broncos	557	:Giants-Logo-Oldschool:	-1.0	0.238346740603447	0.48979986464275355
train	ylj5rc	iuyx4te	t3_ylj5rc	[IN] beautiful drive 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter describes the drive as 'beautiful,' indicating admiration, which is typically directed at the team they support, especially since there is no parent comment suggesting context otherwise. This implies that the 'beautiful drive' refers to the in-group team (Eagles) executing the drive. Hence, this sentence is tagged with [IN] implicitly, as there are no explicit words referring to the in-group in the comment.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the in-group, Eagles, is high, indicating they are likely doing well in the game. The phrase "beautiful drive" usually implies admiration or positivity towards a successful offensive play. Given that the commenter is an Eagles supporter and the Eagles are performing well, it is reasonable to assume that the compliment is directed towards the in-group team's offensive drive. Since there's no explicit word or phrase referring to the in-group, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] to indicate that the comment is implicitly about the Eagles.	1667524145.0	eagles	texans	558		3.0	0.878809094429016	0.31440402247855664

In the second sentence, Nick Saban is referenced along with a dolphin emoji (🐬), symbolizing the Miami Dolphins. Since the Dolphins are neither the in-group nor the out-group, they should be tagged as [OTHER]. Therefore, "Tom Brady" is tagged as [OUT], and 🐬 is tagged as [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: The commenter mentions Tom Brady, who is a player for the Buccaneers, the out-group team, so "Tom Brady" should be tagged [OUT]. Nick Saban has no current affiliation with the Saints or Buccaneers but has a past NFL coaching history with the Miami Dolphins, which is indicated by the dolphin emoji (🐬). Since the Dolphins are neither the in-group nor the out-group team in this context, the dolphin emoji is tagged [OTHER]. The high win probability for the Saints suggests they are likely winning, and the comment indirectly references past events rather than the current game.	1639973653.0	saints	buccaneers	559		14.0	0.9909237027168274	0.9876294591484465

'Were' in the first and third sentences refer to 'we', meaning the Bears, thus should be tagged [IN]. 'the defense' is being praised after mentioning blown coverages, implying it is the commenter’s team's defense, which should also be tagged [IN]. The 'the Rams' in the second sentence explicitly refers to the out-group team and should be tagged [OUT]. Lastly, the term 'ourselves' indicates the Bears as a team, reflecting a self-critical view of the in-group's performance, and should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing both positive and negative aspects of the game from the perspective of a Bears fan, given that the in-group is the Bears. The first sentence mentions "we" (denoted as 'Were'), who are still in the game because apart from two blown coverages, the defense has been good. Since the commenter is a Bears fan, "we" and "the defense" refer to the in-group, the Bears, so 'Were' and 'the defense' are tagged [IN].  In the second sentence, "the rams" are clearly the opposing team, so it's tagged [OUT]. The sentence also discusses negative plays (4th down attempts and a red zone interception), likely attributed to the Bears' offense, which is inherently the fault of the in-group, as indicated by the mention of "offense / Nagy", who is a coach for the in-group.  The third sentence indicates "we" (denoted as 'Were') are beating "ourselves", which again refers to the in-group, implying self-inflicted mistakes by the Bears. Both 'Were' and 'ourselves' are therefore tagged [IN].  The low win probability reflects the challenging situation for the Bears, adding context to why the commenter is	1631499547.0	bears	rams	560	Bears	2.0	0.097919881343842	0.6958083832335329

Since Deebo Samuel is part of the in-group team (49ers), 'DEEBO' should be tagged with [IN]. The use of an enthusiastic exclamation ('LFG', which stands for "Let's F***ing Go") further indicates that the commenter is cheering for the in-group team and its player. Therefore, 'DEEBO' is correctly tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing enthusiasm and encouragement by using "LFG," which stands for "Let's Fucking Go," directed towards "DEBO," a shorthand referring to Deebo Samuel, a well-known player on the 49ers team (the in-group). The win probability is low, indicating the in-group may be struggling, so rallying support for a key player is typical. Consequently, "DEEBO" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	1641768851.0	49ers	rams	561	:jerseyhome19: Deebo Samuel	1.0	0.19741871536407396	0.46368861024033436
train	10czyty	j4jcl9s	t3_10czyty	[IN] playing fucking soft 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[2]	 The comment criticizes playing "soft," which is something a fan typically says about their own team out of frustration. Given that there is no explicit mention of the team in the sentence, the entire sentence "[SENT]" is tagged with [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Ravens, who the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment "playing fucking soft" does not specify any team, but the sentiment is negative and it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is frustrated with the in-group team, especially given that the win probability is quite low at 26.4%. This suggests that the Ravens, the in-group, are not performing well. Thus, the comment is implicitly criticizing the Ravens. Since there is no explicit word or phrase referring to the in-group, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to capture the implicit reference to the Ravens.	1673838176.0	ravens	bengals	562		7.0	0.263732731342316	0.5904998162440279

Therefore, 'Browns' is correctly tagged with [IN]. In the second sentence, the commenter speaks highly of Njoku, a player for the Browns, further indicating that Njoku should also be tagged with [IN], as the commenter's praise is directed towards an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The commenter supports the Browns, and they are reflecting positively on an experience related to this team. Since 'Browns' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, it should be tagged as [IN]. Additionally, Njoku is a player for the Browns; hence, 'Njoku' should also be tagged as [IN]. The win probability of 56.9% suggests that the in-group is performing well, which aligns with the positive sentiment in the comment. Thus, both 'Browns' and 'Njoku' are correctly tagged as [IN].	1669582851.0	browns	buccaneers	565	:orange_pants:	5.0	0.568684786674567	0.8775309451594393

The commenter expresses amusement at seeing a negative action (holding) by an out-group player, which aligns with the rivalry between the in-group (Bears) and the out-group (Lions). Therefore, 'lions' should be tagged as [OUT], as it specifically refers to the opponent team.	EXPLANATION: The comment specifically mentions a "lions lineman," which clearly refers to a player from the out-group, the Lions. The commenter is amused by the replay showing the out-group player holding, which indicates a penalty against the opponent team. Given the high win probability for the Bears (the in-group), the commenter is likely not worried about this play, reinforcing that the focus is on the out-group making a mistake. Therefore, "lions" should be tagged with [OUT].	1668370279.0	bears	lions	566	Smokin' Jay	10.0	0.918714433908463	0.7289719626168224

Given that there is no additional context and the commenter is a Buccaneers supporter, it is reasonable to assume that their negative comment is about the out-group team, the Saints. The lack of explicit mention of a specific team suggests an implicit reference, thus the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The commenter expresses frustration by calling something "Such trash," but does not provide a clear referent within the comment. With no parent comment to provide additional context, it's likely they are talking about an element of the out-group (Saints) since fans often disparage the opponent when their team isn't doing well, as evidenced by the relatively low win probability (37.8%) for the Buccaneers. Because no explicit word or phrase refers to the out-group, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as [OUT] to denote that the disparaging remark is implicitly about the opponent team.	1639971092.0	buccaneers	saints	570	:brooksjersey: Brooks Jersey	2.0	0.378107249736786	0.7420406597621787

The Buccaneers are known for firing cannons at their home stadium, which contextualizes 'They' as referring to the out-group in this scenario. Thus, 'They' is tagged with [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment 'started firing the cannons' likely refers to a tradition that the Buccaneers (the out-group team) have, which is signified by the use of the word 'cannons' since it is a well-known part of their home game celebrations. Given the context and the high win probability for the Cowboys, it further suggests that the commenter is somewhat mocking or finding humor in the Buccaneers' actions despite their poor performance ('failed 2 pt attempt'). Therefore, 'they' in the comment refers to the out-group team, the Buccaneers, and should be tagged with [OUT].	1673926566.0	cowboys	buccaneers	142	CeeDee Lamb	14.0	0.9864308283925056	0.7398945518453427

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses dissatisfaction about a decision made during the game, which implies a bias towards the in-group team (Browns). The commenter is likely upset about something that negatively impacts their team – a common sentiment among fans when they perceive unfair treatment. The sentence does not explicitly mention any team but is implicitly about the in-group because fans typically react to such incidents involving their own team more strongly. Therefore, `[SENT]` should be tagged with `[IN]` since the comment implicitly refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment seems to express frustration about a perceived unfair treatment during the game, likely referring to an incident involving a coach and a player. Given the win probability is relatively low for the in-group (Browns) and the negative tone, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is expressing dissatisfaction about an incident involving their team. The frustration expressed in the comment suggests it is implicitly about the in-group team (Browns) without explicitly mentioning them. Therefore, the entire comment is tagged as [IN], with '[SENT]' representing the implicit reference in the first sentence.	1631479792.0	browns	chiefs	571	:brownie-elf:	11.0	0.413454413414001	0.1323515960852465

'we' almost always refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, which is the Cowboys in this case. Because the entire sentiment is likely about the troubles of the in-group, '[SENT]' in the first sentence and 'we' in the second sentence should be tagged [IN] since both refer to the in-group implicitly and explicitly, respectively.	EXPLANATION: The comment appears to be sarcastic in nature, likely expressing frustration with the current state of the game or a particular play. Given the very close win probability, the in-group team (Cowboys) is not in a secure position. The phrase "just what we need" refers to the in-group as the commenter is using "we," which indicates alignment with the commenter’s supported team, the Cowboys. The first sentence does not explicitly mention any group but, combined with the context of frustration, "[SENT]" should be tagged with [IN] as it is implicitly about the in-group team. Thus, 'we' should clearly be tagged [IN], and since the first sentence implicitly refers to the in-group, it is correct to tag it [IN] as well.	1632087517.0	cowboys	chargers	573	CeeDee Lamb	2.0	0.526518076658249	0.42482331300222675

In this context, the commenter is recognizing a recurring issue or sentiment that they and fellow supporters express every week, indicating an ongoing concern or frustration related to their team. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the Eagles, the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The phrase "We say that every week lol" uses "We," which in the context of a sports comment typically refers to the supporters or fans of the in-group team—the Eagles in this scenario. Given that the win probability is very high (96.2%), it suggests that the Eagles are likely winning, supporting the idea that "We" refers to fans of the in-group who might frequently experience stressful games despite the team's success. Hence, "We" should be tagged with [IN].	1665976523.0	eagles	cowboys	574		2.0	0.962443400174379	0.9563727306409782

['he']	[(13, 15)]	['[IN]']	[3]	 The commenter is discussing a player (expressed as "he") waving goodbye, which follows the context of the parent comment noting that it is crazy to wave when barely beating a backup. Since the in-group is the Ravens, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is referring to a Ravens player who might have been seen making this gesture. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged [IN], as it implicitly refers to a Ravens player.	EXPLANATION: The phrase "he" in this comment is likely referring to a player on the Ravens, because the parent comment is discussing the act of waving after a game, and given that the in-group team (Ravens) has a 100% win probability, the implied context is that it's a Ravens player who was waving. The commenter is not disparaging this player, just providing a plausible explanation for the action mentioned in the parent comment. Hence, "he" should be tagged with [IN] since it denotes a player on the in-group team, the Ravens.	1673842971.0	ravens	bengals	576		1.0	1.0	1.0

In the context of sports discussions, fans generally refer to their team using inclusive pronouns like 'we.' In the first sentence, 'We' implies that the Colts (the in-group) have left points on the field, indicating missed scoring opportunities. Similarly, in the second sentence, the commenter expresses a hope for their team to find a way to score, further implying in-group support. Therefore, 'We' and 'we' should be tagged as [IN], as they refer to the Colts, the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses frustration and concern about the current performance of the in-group team, the Colts. The use of "We" and "we" implicitly refers to the in-group team without mentioning them explicitly. The low win probability of 17.0% indicates that the Colts are struggling, and the commenter is focusing on their inability to capitalize on scoring opportunities. Therefore, "We" and "we" should be tagged [IN] as they clearly refer to the in-group team, the Colts. The sentences without explicit in-group mentions also implicitly address the in-group's need to improve their performance. Thus, both sentences should be tagged [IN].	1632074520.0	colts	rams	578	Raheem Morris	10.0	0.169599190354347	0.3381852551984877

['we', 'we']	[(14, 16), (44, 46)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter uses "we" twice, which usually refers to the in-group team they support. The frustration expressed in the comment about losing coin tosses or wanting the ball first suggests that the commenter is talking about their own team, in this case, the Raiders. Therefore, "we" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	The comment uses "we" twice, which usually indicates a reference to the in-group team that the commenter supports. The phrase "we lose every coin toss" suggests that the commenter is talking about their own team's (the Raiders) perceived bad luck with the coin toss, or their choice to receive the ball first. The high win probability (72.3%) indicates the Raiders are likely doing well in the game, but this specific comment is focused on a general event (coin toss) that happens irrespective of the win probability. Therefore, both instances of "we" should be tagged [IN] as they clearly refer to the in-group team, the Raiders.	1670548565.0	raiders	rams	579		3.0	0.722561120986938	0.0023711810305517556

Since the in-group team is the 49ers, 'Kittle' should be tagged as [IN]. The comment is expressing enthusiasm or cheering for the 49ers' player, clearly indicating support for the in-group. Thus, 'Kittle' is correctly tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: George Kittle is a well-known player for the 49ers, which is the in-group team for the commenter. Given that the win probability is high, it is likely that the commenter is expressing excitement or praise towards Kittle. Therefore, 'Kittle' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to a player on the in-group team.	1669083197.0	49ers	cardinals	581	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	6.0	0.9389179130529719	0.3199290912483672

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	[2]	 The comment states "That’s a fumble," and without additional context, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is referring to a mistake made by the opposing team, the Chargers. Fans are more likely to highlight errors by the out-group, so the sentence is implicitly about the out-group. There are no explicit words referring to the out-group in the comment, thus '[SENT]' is tagged as [OUT] because the context implies the out-group (Chargers).	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the Chiefs is relatively high, indicating they are doing well in the game. The comment "That’s a fumble" is an immediate reaction to a play and, in the context of a relatively favorable win probability, it is likely that the commenter is referring to a positive event for the in-group team (Chiefs). Because fumbles are moments that the opposing team (Chargers) loses possession to the commenter’s team (Chiefs), the comment implicitly refers to the out-group (Chargers). Since there's no explicit mention of the team, the entire "[SENT]" should be tagged with [OUT].	1669002561.0	chiefs	chargers	582		8.0	0.6614640355110171	0.8252318066872717

Since the commenter supports the Bills and Allen is likely referring to Josh Allen, the quarterback for the Bills, this name should be tagged as [IN]. Therefore, 'Allen' is tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group player the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 99.2% indicates that the in-group, the Bills, are doing exceptionally well. 'Allen' likely refers to Josh Allen, the Bills' quarterback, especially since it makes sense to encourage a key player from the in-group team in a comment made by a supporter. Therefore, 'Allen' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	1665962748.0	bills	chiefs	583	:block-B::block-I::block-L::block-L::block-S:	3.0	0.991523027420044	0.952963974279926

[SENT] Tragic 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The overall tone of the comment is critical, which suggests the commenter is talking about their own team, the in-group Patriots, especially since they appear to be complaining about a strategical decision (burning clock reducing chances of a first down). This is something fans typically criticize their own team for, rather than an opponent. The first sentence talks about a specific play, but since it does not specify the team, it is reasonable to infer it is about the Patriots. The second sentence, "Tragic," also expresses dissatisfaction, implying that the commenter is disappointed with in-group performance. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged as '[IN]' because the comment is criticizing the in-group implicitly, despite the lack of explicit words referring to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The win probability shows that the Patriots, the in-group, are not doing well in the game. The comment expresses frustration over a 2nd down run that was a poor strategic move, leading to burning the clock and reducing the chances of a first down. Since the comment is about a negative play (burning clock, reducing chances), the commenter is likely referring to their own team (Patriots). Therefore, the sentences are implicitly about the in-group, which is the Patriots. The entire first sentence is tagged as [IN], even without an explicit reference, because the context clearly indicates that the commenter is talking about their own team's poor play. The word 'Tragic' in the second sentence implicitly continues this sentiment. Therefore, 'That 2nd down run' and the entire first sentence implicitly refer to the in-group. The 'Tragic' sentiment without explicit mention reinforces the critique of the in-group, hence the tagging of '[SENT]' to reflect this.	1662923731.0	patriots	dolphins	584		4.0	0.035564184188842995	0.7797848188727667

Since the commenter is a supporter of the Ravens (in-group), it is logical that they want to watch their own team play. Therefore, 'ravens' in the comment should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The commenter explicitly mentions wanting a link to watch the "ravens game," indicating they are interested in the game of the Ravens, the in-group team the commenter supports. Given that "ravens" directly refers to the in-group team, it has been correctly tagged as [IN]. The high win probability suggests that the commenter is likely relaxed and confident enough about their team's chances, which aligns with the casual tone of the request for the game link.	1662921174.0	ravens	jets	585		0.0	0.87410044670105	0.4761252624851639

This phrase directly includes the name of the in-group team ('Browns'), so it should be tagged with [IN]. Since the comment is only related to the in-group and does not reference the opponent or any other team, the only tagged expression is 'Browns'.	EXPLANATION: The comment is showing enthusiastic support for the Browns by using the phrase "Let’s go Browns!". The term "Browns" explicitly refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. The phrase "Let’s go" combined with the team name and the dog emoji (which is associated with the Browns' "Dawg Pound" fan base) indicates encouragement and motivation for the in-group team. Therefore, "Browns" should be tagged with [IN] as it directly refers to the team the commenter supports.	1634500642.0	browns	cardinals	586	:brownie-elf:	2.0	0.595943093299866	0.0

In the context of sports talk, "running the GD ball" and the use of exclamations like "JFC" indicate criticism of their own team (the Bears). The third sentence talks about the effect on "fields," referring to Justin Fields, the quarterback for the Bears. Therefore, both the first and second sentences implicitly refer to the in-group team, and thus '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN] for those sentences. 'fields' in the third sentence should be tagged [IN] as well because it refers to a player on the in-group team.	The comment is critical of the team's strategy of running the ball too much, which is a critique an in-group fan would more likely direct at their own team rather than the opponent. The reference to "develop fields" is about Justin Fields, the Bears' quarterback, indicating that the commenter is concerned with his development, which aligns with being an in-group fan. The win probability is relatively low, contributing to the overall frustration expressed. Therefore, the first and second sentences are implicitly about the in-group, and 'fields' explicitly refers to a player on the in-group team.  - The first and second sentences' dissatisfaction with the strategy should be tagged [IN] since it reflects a critique from a supporter.  - 'JFC' is an exclamation that further expresses frustration at the in-group, thus should be tagged [IN]. - 'fields' specifically mentions the in-group quarterback, hence should be tagged [IN].  Therefore, 'Stop running the GD ball so much' and 'JFC' are implicitly referring to the in-group, along with 'fields', making the overall comment implicitly about the in-group team.	1668366378.0	bears	lions	587		-9.0	0.444254040718079	0.36070990276597753

['the coaching staff']	[(19, 37)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The phrase 'the coaching staff' in this context most likely refers to the in-group team, the Vikings. Fans often criticize their own team's coaching decisions when things aren't going well, and there's no mention of the opponent (Lions) here. Therefore, 'the coaching staff' should be tagged [IN] because it implies the commenter is talking about their own team (the Vikings) being cautious and not taking risks.	Given the high win probability of 89.8%, the in-group team (Vikings) is likely ahead in the game. However, the comment suggests frustration with the coaching staff, implying that even though the team is doing well, the commenter wishes they would take more risks to secure the win definitively. The phrase "the coaching staff" typically indicates the in-group unless otherwise specified, as fans often criticize their own team’s coaching decisions. Since there's no indication the commenter is talking about the opponent's coaching staff, it is reasonable to infer that the dissatisfaction is directed towards the Vikings' coaching staff.  Thus, 'the coaching staff' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group (Vikings). The sentence as a whole is about the in-group being cautious, linking the general sentiment to the in-group implicitly, hence the correct tagging.  EXPLANATION: The comment indicates frustration with the team’s (Vikings) coaching staff for being too cautious, despite a high win probability. 'the coaching staff' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group.	1633891648.0	vikings	lions	589	Randall McGodDamnDaniel	5.0	0.898255228996277	0.6016997708174179

['we', 'Ryan']	[(39, 41), (122, 126)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The expression 'we' in the first sentence refers to the in-group team, as indicated by the use of 'we' which generally refers to the team that the commenter supports (the Colts in this case). This pronoun usage implies a collective effort involving the in-group. In the second sentence, 'Ryan' refers to Matt Ryan, the quarterback for the Colts, thus making him a member of the in-group. The sentence is complaining about an issue that the in-group team is facing, which aligns with discussing their own team’s struggles. Therefore, 'we' and 'Ryan' are appropriately tagged as [IN].	The commenter is discussing efforts to replicate past success, which logically refers to the in-group, the Colts, since fans often refer to their own team as 'we'. Thus, 'we' should be tagged [IN]. The parent comment talks about a potential identity issue with the in-group, suggesting a focus on their own performance. 'Ryan' is in reference to Matt Ryan, the quarterback for the Colts, so he should also be tagged [IN]. The win probability is low, indicating the in-group is struggling, which fits the context of discussing the challenges faced rather than the success of the opponent. The phrases 'we' and 'Ryan' are therefore correctly tagged as [IN] for the in-group, the Colts.	1666553463.0	colts	titans	590		1.0	0.093788862228394	0.8671554252199414
train	y5kddd	iskocpl	t3_y5kddd	[SENT] Watch [OUT] get a td her before the half 	['them']	[(13, 17)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment seems to express a concern that the opposing team may score a touchdown (td) before the half. Since 'them' refers to the team the commenter is wary of or considers a threat, it likely refers to the out-group, which is the Vikings in this case. Therefore, 'them' should be tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely referring to the out-group team, the Vikings, scoring a touchdown before the half, which is something a fan would be concerned about given the relatively low win probability for the Dolphins. The phrase 'them' doesn't refer to the in-group (Dolphins) since fans typically use 'us' or 'we' for their own team. Consequently, 'them' should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the out-group, the Vikings.	1665944856.0	dolphins	vikings	591		1.0	0.198696315288544	0.456940586074021

['Harris', 'him']	[(21, 27), (36, 39)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenters are discussing a play or advice given during the game. The first sentence involves a player named Harris, who is Najee Harris, a running back for the Steelers (the in-group). Therefore, 'Harris' is tagged as [IN]. The pronoun 'him' likely refers to another player on the same team since they are receiving advice from Harris, thus it should also be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence, "Pointing up field," continues the discussion of this interaction within the team, so the [SENT] token remains untagged as it doesn't explicitly mention any team or player.	The context here provides clues that the communication is happening within the team the commenter supports since it is about instructing/feedback, which typically happens among in-group players. 'Harris' is a reference to Najee Harris, a player on the Steelers, the in-group team. Therefore, he is tagged [IN]. 'Him' is logically referring to another player on the same team, since Harris is giving feedback to him; thus 'him' is tagged [IN] as well. The low win probability indicates the team might be struggling, so in-group interactions tend to focus on attempts to resolve issues, which aligns with the context of advising on-field movement (`JUST KEEP RUNNING`, `Pointing up field`). Thus, labeling both 'Harris' and 'him' as [IN] is consistent with the interactions depicted in the comment and the identity of the in-group team. The 'Pointing up field' sentence lacks a specific entity mention but inherits the context of the previous sentence, thus isn't tagged separately.	1668983963.0	steelers	bengals	592	:sh::h8::sh: Home Jersey	1.0	0.290670543909073	0.3749051353402479

Additionally, "the rook" is likely referring to a rookie on the Jets' team, thus it is also tagged with [IN]. This aligns with the sentiment expressing frustration with specific players on the in-group team. Therefore, both "Flacco" and "the rook" should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is complaining about Flacco, who is the Jets' quarterback, indicating frustration with the in-group player. The extremely low win probability suggests the in-group team (Jets) is performing poorly, leading to the annoyance expressed. The phrase "Get the rook his TD loser" refers to getting a touchdown for a rookie, likely another in-group player (Jets rookie), showing a continued focus on their team. Therefore, 'Flacco' should be tagged [IN], and 'the rook' also refers to an in-group player and should be tagged [IN] as well.	1662926843.0	jets	ravens	593	:PlayerQuinnen:	1.0	0.0002439618110656	0.993700356066831

Given that the commenter is supporting the Giants (in-group) and expressing concern for Barkley, it is reasonable to conclude they are referring to their own team's player. Hence, 'Barkley' should be tagged with [IN] as it denotes a player from the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: Barkley refers to Saquon Barkley, who is a player for the New York Giants, the in-group team in this context. The low win probability indicates the Giants are not doing well right now, and the comment suggests concern for an in-group player, hoping for his well-being. Thus, 'Barkley' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a member of the in-group team.	1665329870.0	giants	packers	595		3.0	0.10266233980655703	0.6985918119929124

Given the in-group is the Steelers (a Pennsylvania-based team), any mention of fans belonging to other Pennsylvania teams would fall under 'other', as it is neither the in-group (Steelers) nor the out-group (Seahawks). Therefore, 'Eagles' refers to the Philadelphia Eagles, a team from Pennsylvania that is distinct from both the in-group and the out-group in this context. Consequently, 'Eagles' should be tagged [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: The comment is referring to 'Eagles fans,' which refers to fans of a different team, the Philadelphia Eagles. Since the in-group team is the Steelers and the out-group team for this game is the Seahawks, the Eagles are neither the in-group nor the out-group team in this context. Therefore, the term 'Eagles' should be tagged as [OTHER], as it refers to another NFL team that isn't currently participating in the game being discussed.	1634527646.0	steelers	seahawks	596	:troy1::troy2:Troy	1.0	0.671148121356964	0.8415097205346294

Therefore, the entire sentence should be tagged as [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: The term "BS PI call" (bullshit pass interference call) likely refers to a judgment error by the referees, which usually implies an outside party not affiliated with either in-group or out-group teams. Referees are not part of the game teams and therefore should be tagged as [OTHER]. The win probability for the in-group Dolphins is very low, reflecting a challenging situation, and the comment seems to be venting frustration not at a specific team, but at an external factor (the referee's call). Thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with [OTHER] to indicate that the frustration is directed towards the referees.	1633890111.0	dolphins	buccaneers	597	99	3.0	0.044967651367188055	0.4479450766481708

This implies the commenter is talking about their own (in-group) team’s fan base and its shortcomings. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Falcons).	The commenter is discussing the fan base, implicitly referring to the in-group team (Falcons). The use of 'we' indicates that the commenter is including themselves as part of the group, which would not be logical to do for an out-group or other group. 'we' should therefore be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, the Falcons. The overall sentiment and win probability also align with this being a reflection on the in-group's situation.	1668133453.0	falcons	panthers	598	num7	1.0	0.19756031036376898	0.3804125627206839

Since the Jaguars are the out-group opponent in this context, "Jags" should be tagged as [OUT]. The lack of discipline and poor coaching are criticisms typically directed towards the out-group team, affirming that "Jags" is a reference to the opponent. There are no explicit references to the in-group team in this sentence.	EXPLANATION: The game is between the 49ers and Jaguars, and the comment is explicitly criticizing the Jaguars by calling them undisciplined and having awful coaching. 'Jags' is a shorthand for the Jaguars, the out-group team for the commenter. Since the win probability is 100%, it indicates that the 49ers have essentially won the game, and the commenter is commenting on the poor performance of the opposing team. Hence, 'Jags' should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to the out-group opponent team.	1637526594.0	49ers	jaguars	599	:trentwilliams: Trent Williams	6.0	0.9999650716781616	0.8975218362786919

The commenter would not express such dissatisfaction towards the opponent. Since there is no explicit reference to the Ravens, the in-group team, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to indicate the implicit reference to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment is referring to a situation where the Ravens did not succeed in getting a first down, which aligns with the in-group team having a low win probability of 18.2%. The term "you" implicitly refers to the in-group team (Ravens), as fans often criticize their own team in such contexts. Since there is no explicit mention of the in-group team, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] to denote that it is implicitly talking about the in-group team.	1666921979.0	ravens	buccaneers	601		2.0	0.18183040618896495	0.5194839857651246
train	rolagm	hpzou2t	t3_rolagm	[SENT] [OTHER] blowing us out next week 	['Cowboys']	[(7, 14)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The commenter mentions the Cowboys, which is neither the in-group team (Cardinals) nor the out-group team (Colts) in this NFL game. Instead, the Cowboys are another team within the NFL. The mention of "us" refers to the in-group team, the Cardinals, but there is no explicit word referring to the in-group in the comment. Therefore, "Cowboys" is correctly tagged as [OTHER], and the sentence as a whole implicitly refers to an in-group concern about a future game against another opponent.	EXPLANATION: The in-group is the Cardinals and the out-group is the Colts, as specified by the context of this game. However, the comment references the Cowboys, who are a different team from either the in-group or out-group. Therefore, 'Cowboys' should be tagged as [OTHER] since they are not one of the two teams involved in the current match. The term 'us' implicitly refers to the in-group team (Cardinals), but since it lacks an explicit referring expression, it doesn't need to be tagged separately in this context.	1640492191.0	cardinals	colts	602		10.0	0.0520428903400898	0.9893452326746198
train	sag7hw	htu3dey	t3_sag7hw	[SENT] WHATCHA DOIN [IN] 	['WILLIS']	[(20, 26)]	['[IN]']	[2]	 The comment seems to be directed at a player named Willis, asking what he is doing in a critical or frustrated tone. Given that the commenter is a fan of the 49ers and there is no indication that Willis is a player for the out-group Packers, it is reasonable to assume that Willis is a member of the in-group team, the 49ers. Therefore, 'WILLIS' should be tagged as [IN], indicating it refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment appears to be addressing or questioning a player named Willis directly about his actions during the game. Since Willis is being addressed without context that would suggest he's from the out-group or another team, it is reasonable to assume Willis is a player on the in-group team (the 49ers). The win probability of 39.5% suggests that the in-group (49ers) is currently losing, which might explain why the commenter is questioning Willis's actions, possibly out of frustration. Therefore, 'WILLIS' should be tagged [IN] because he is likely a member of the in-group team that the commenter supports.	1642909785.0	49ers	packers	603	:jerseyhome11: Brandon Aiyuk	6.0	0.394732367393991	0.8920877209931407

Najee Harris is a running back for the Steelers, the commenter’s in-group team. The name "Harris" refers to a player on the Steelers, thus it should be tagged [IN]. This indicates the commenter is concerned about the performance of their own team's player, hence the emphasis on 'Harris' who belongs to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 4.7% suggests that the in-group team (Steelers) is performing poorly. Harris is a player for the Steelers, the in-group team the commenter supports. The commenter finds it disturbing to see Harris, an in-group player, getting hit in the backfield, which implies concern for the in-group's performance. Therefore, 'Harris' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	1632684127.0	steelers	bengals	605	:sb::b8::b6::sb: Hines Ward	6.0	0.0465884208679199	0.768990539175163

Since the Jaguars are the team the commenter supports, this positive comment about an individual player's performance implies that both 'Etienne' and 'the whole team' refer to the in-group. Consequently, 'Etienne' should be tagged [IN] as an in-group player, and 'the whole team' should also be tagged [IN] as it refers to the Jaguars.	EXPLANATION: The commenter likely supports the Jaguars, who are playing against the Broncos. With the Jaguars' win probability being slightly positive at 58.2%, it appears that they are doing reasonably well. The mention of 'Etienne' refers to Travis Etienne, a player for the Jaguars, indicating that an in-group player is performing exceptionally and is essentially the reason for the team's current status. 'the whole team' here refers to the Jaguars collectively, as it implies that Etienne (an in-group player) is making the biggest impact for his team. Thus, both 'Etienne' and 'the whole team' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to in-group members.	1667146029.0	jaguars	broncos	606		6.0	0.581847906112671	0.883352208380521
train	y5l29g	iskkin0	t3_y5l29g	[SENT] Okay [IN] … c’mon 	['defense']	[(12, 19)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter uses the term 'defense' without specifying a particular team. Given that the commenter is a supporter of the Browns, it is reasonable to assume they are addressing the performance of their own team's defense. The urging phrase "c'mon" is a form of encouragement typically directed towards the in-group team. Therefore, 'defense' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team's defensive unit.	EXPLANATION: The term 'defense' is referring to the in-group team, which is the Browns in this context. This is indicated by the casual and familiar tone ("Okay defense ... c’mon"), suggesting that the commenter is addressing their own team's defense with the expectation of improving performance. Additionally, without any explicit indication that they are referring to the opponent's defense, and considering the typical fan behavior of directly addressing their own team to spur them on, it is reasonable to tag 'defense' with [IN]. Thus 'defense' should be tagged [IN] since it denotes the in-group team.	1665943422.0	browns	patriots	577	:Baghead:	3.0	0.497956454753876	0.3029851980484578

Watson, however, plays for the Browns, the opposing team in this context, but because the Browns are identified as the out-group and "Watson" is named explicitly, traditional context dictates not tagging as [OUT]. It is better suited to be tagged as [OTHER], expressing the commenter's discontent as if speaking about an unrelated third party. This intersectional usage translates to an implicit dissociation from the immediate game context. Thus, "Watson" is tagged [OTHER].	The commenter expresses frustration that the in-group players ('our guys') are not taking the game seriously, reflected in their low win probability. With 'Watson' mentioned in the comment, it could suggest Deshaun Watson, who has no association with either the Commanders or the Browns at this time, making him an 'other' entity. Hence, 'our guys' (referring to in-group players) is tagged [IN], and 'Watson' is tagged [OTHER].	1672604447.0	commanders	browns	607		4.0	0.122001647949219	0.820845293477185

"the Bears" clearly identifies the in-group team the commenter supports, which is also referenced implicitly by "the team" in the context of a love/hate relationship where no other team is mentioned or alluded to. Therefore, "the Bears" and "the team" should be tagged as [IN], correctly representing the entities as in-group.	EXPLANATION: With a stated win probability of 20.6%, it is fairly clear that the in-group (the Bears) is struggling in the game. The commenter is expressing loyalty to the Bears, despite having a 'love/hate relationship' with the team. As such, 'the Bears' and 'the team' both refer to the in-group, and should be tagged with [IN]. The entire sentiment of the comment is centered around the in-group team, making it evident that the commenter is speaking about their allegiance to the in-group.	1669576161.0	bears	jets	608	Bears	6.0	0.20594717562198595	0.39984030342349536
train	xnr6tj	ipv0spl	t3_xnr6tj	[SENT] Give it to [IN] cmon 	['him']	[(18, 21)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment "Give it to him cmon" is a directive, likely expressing the desire for a player on the in-group team to receive the ball. Since the commenter is a fan of the Bengals and they are urging the ball to be given to a player, "him" is implicitly referring to a player on the Bengals team. Therefore, "him" should be tagged [IN] because it is a reference to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is urging the action of giving the ball to 'him,' implying that 'him' is a player the commenter supports and wants to see with the ball. The in-group is the Bengals, and since 'him' is not qualified to indicate the out-group, it is reasonable to assume it refers to a Bengals player. This aligns with the context of the commentary, where the win probability for the Bengals is high at 80.3%, suggesting positive sentiment towards the team's strategy or key players. Therefore, 'him' should be tagged with [IN], and the rest of the sentence reflects this enthusiasm for the in-group action.	1664126100.0	bengals	jets	609		1.0	0.803380489349365	0.06387002492908106

['Allen']	[(35, 40)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 Allen refers to Keenan Allen, a player for the Chargers, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. The comment is questioning an issue with the performance of a player from their own team, indicating frustration or concern typical of a fan discussing their own team. Therefore, 'Allen' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is likely a supporter of the Chargers and is pointing out an issue with a player named Allen, which is Keenan Allen, a wide receiver for the Chargers. The question about what's wrong with his hands this year suggests disappointment in his performance, a sentiment an in-group fan would more likely express about their own player. The low win probability also aligns with a critical tone towards an in-group player. 'Allen' should therefore be tagged [IN] because he is a member of the in-group team that the commenter supports.	1633905564.0	chargers	browns	610		2.0	0.198683798313141	0.770989818060424

Therefore, the target tagging and the referring expressions selected are accurate with respect to the in-group, out-group, and other entities.	EXPLANATION: The comment is about the future of the Texans and their coach Lovie Smith. The first sentence is a neutral statement, so it is not tagged. In the second sentence, "we" refers to the in-group team, the Texans, so it is tagged [IN]. "Bryce Young" is a player who is not part of the in-group or out-group and is a draft prospect from college football, thus tagged [OTHER]. In the fourth sentence, "He" refers to Lovie Smith, who is the current coach of the in-group team Texans, so it is tagged [IN]. "the team" also refers to the in-group team Texans and is tagged [IN] as well. The win probability is very low, suggesting that the comment is about future changes to improve the team's prospects, further supporting the in-group tagging.	1669574344.0	texans	dolphins	612	:doodle16:	1.0	0.04495537281036399	0.19990829894543788
train	sgg2xj	hux2tox	t3_sgg2xj	[IN] Smoke the cigar 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The phrase "Smoke the cigar" is likely a celebratory expression, often associated with victorious moments, especially in sports contexts. The commenter, supporting the Bengals, seems to be implying that their team is about to or has just won, an occasion for celebration. Therefore, this sentiment is clearly in support of the in-group team, the Bengals. Since there is no explicit word or phrase referring to the in-group, the entire sentence is tagged as '[IN]'. This reflects the implicit reference to the in-group team in the context of celebration.	EXPLANATION: The win probability is 0.0%, indicating the Bengals are very likely to lose or have already lost. The phrase 'Smoke the cigar' could be a reference to a tradition in Cincinnati, where Bengals' quarterback Joe Burrow is known to smoke a cigar after a victory. Despite the context of the loss, the commenter might be expressing a hopeful or defiant sentiment towards the in-group team's cultural moments. Since there is no explicit reference to either team, the implicit reference here is about the in-group, the Bengals, hence '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN].	1643584608.0	bengals	chiefs	613		1.0	0.0	1.0

Since the comment does not contain any explicit mention of player names or teams, but implicitly assumes a perspective of the in-group, the word "they" is tagged as [IN]. The commenter is likely referring to the Ravens' defensive players, indicating that "they" should be associated with the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: Given that the in-group team is the Ravens and the out-group team is the Packers, the commenter is likely talking about a play they wish the Ravens would use. The reference to "crashing that hard" suggests discussing how the out-group (Packers) defense is playing aggressively. 'they' in this context refers to the Ravens adjusting their strategy to exploit the Packers' aggressive defense. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged with [IN]. The overall win probability being low indicates the Ravens are currently behind, so the comment is more likely to focus on what the Ravens (in-group) should do in response.	1639950414.0	ravens	packers	614	 :ELITE:	2.0	0.271143198013306	0.11542261744363604

The comment expresses frustration and suggests putting in a backup player, which is something fans typically suggest only for their own team. Since 'sinnet' is part of the Dolphins, it should be tagged with [IN]. The phrase 'this game over' also implies a resignation to their own team's performance, further suggesting an in-group context. Therefore, 'sinnet' should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 3.3% indicates that the in-group team (Dolphins) is in a losing position, which matches the resigned tone of the comment. 'sinnet' refers to Reid Sinnett, a third-string quarterback for the Dolphins. Fans often call for backup players to be played when the game feels out of reach, demonstrating dissatisfaction with the current performance. Therefore, 'sinnet' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a player on the in-group team.	1633288327.0	dolphins	colts	616	:tears:	15.0	0.0330448150634766	0.7235726925584428

['Dallas ’ rushers']	[(101, 117)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is likely a supporter of the in-group, the Cowboys, due to the expression of frustration in the second sentence about "Dallas’ rushers” getting “mugged 24/7," implying unfair treatment by the officials against their team. Therefore, "Dallas' rushers" refers to the in-group players, and it should be tagged [IN]. The first sentence is a general statement about holding calls in football and does not reference any specific team, so no tags are necessary there.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a supporter of the Cowboys, which indicates that 'Dallas' rushers' refers to players on their own team (the Dallas Cowboys). Even though the win probability is high, the commenter is expressing frustration over perceived unfair officiating against their team. The phrase 'holdings on every play' is general, but when the commenter specifies 'Dallas’ rushers,' it refers directly to their in-group team. Thus 'Dallas' rushers' should be tagged [IN] as it points to Cowboys players who are part of the in-group.	1667156560.0	cowboys	bears	618		1.0	0.847344300717115	0.64375

The comment is expressing frustration or critique which typically suggests the commenter is addressing a player from the opposing team, especially since the in-group is the Patriots. Therefore, 'Knox' should be tagged with [OUT] as it refers to an out-group player.	EXPLANATION: While the comment does not directly state whether the action by 'Knox' was good or bad, the win probability for the in-group (Patriots) is low at 13.7%, indicating they are losing. 'Knox' refers to Dawson Knox, a player for the Bills, who are the out-group in this scenario. The commenter is more likely criticizing an action by an opponent player, hence 'Knox' should be tagged [OUT]. The overall frustration implied by "You cant do that" suggests the commenter’s disapproval of the opponent’s actions, making 'Knox' the correct tag for [OUT].	1673210497.0	patriots	bills	620		1.0	0.13697564601898204	0.8480798360509668
train	zp7gk5	j0rx2ul	t1_j0rwzmq	[IN] To make it a 3 point game 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment appears to be a response to a question about a strategic decision ('Why do we go for 2 there??'), indicating a close interest in the decision-making of the in-group team, which in this case is the Bengals. The phrase 'To make it a 3 point game' implies a specific reasoning that is more likely to be made by someone supporting the in-group who wants their team (the Bengals) to reduce the point gap. Thus, although there is no explicit mention of the Bengals, the context of the discussion indicates that the comment refers to the in-group team, and '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	The comment is implicitly referring to a decision made by the in-group team (Bengals) to go for a 2-point conversion, presumably resulting in a failed attempt and thus the need to make it a 3-point game. Given that the win probability indicates the Bengals are slightly underdogs, the commenter is more likely focused on their own team's actions. Since there is no explicit mention of the in-group but the comment contextually refers to an in-game strategy related to the in-group, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	1671405789.0	bengals	buccaneers	621		0.0	0.399076927095652	0.6325489845217858
train	106ou6v	j3i4f6j	t1_j3i4bka	[SENT] [IN] 	['Ohio']	[(7, 11)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 In the context of an NFL game, "Ohio" refers to the state which is home to the Cincinnati Bengals, the out-group opponent. However, since the commenters are Ravens fans and they are booing despite being significantly ahead, it is likely a sarcastic remark about the behavior of their own fans or team, possibly referring to their location or another relevant cultural context. Given this context, "Ohio" can be reasonably interpreted as referring to the in-group. Therefore, "Ohio" should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment simply consists of the word 'Ohio,' which refers to the state where the out-group team (Bengals) is based. However, given that Ohio is more precisely referring to a region where the Ravens have rivals—the Bengals—the context provided by the parent comment and the in-group/out-group designation guides the tagging towards [IN]. This is because commenters often refer to the opponent by their region or state in a disparaging manner, and Ohio has been booing a penalty against the team up 17-0 (implied to be the Bengals). Therefore, 'Ohio' should be tagged with [IN].	1673205037.0	ravens	bengals	622	 :CAKEBIRD:	1.0	0.02974436618387699	0.3375020705648501

The enthusiastic celebration ("WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO") indicates that the commenter is cheering for a successful play or moment associated with Slay, who is part of the in-group. Therefore, 'SLAAAAAAAAAY' is correctly tagged as [IN] because it refers to a player on the Eagles, the team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is celebrating a positive event, most likely a big play by a player on their supported team. Given that "Slay" refers to Darius Slay, a cornerback for the Eagles (the in-group), and the high win probability suggests that the Eagles are performing well, it makes sense that the commenter is cheering for an in-group player. Thus, "SLAAAAAAAAAY" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group player Darius Slay.	1665969851.0	eagles	cowboys	623		2.0	0.965001966804266	0.33836606150426085

[IN] Terrible play calling 	['We', 'we', '[SENT]']	[(7, 9), (24, 26), (93, 99)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The usage of "We" and "we" clearly indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, the Vikings, because fans generally refer to their favorite team in such a familiar manner. Therefore, both occurrences of "We" and "we" should be tagged with [IN]. Additionally, the second sentence expressing "Terrible play calling" continues to criticize the in-group without explicitly stating the team name, so the [SENT] token for that sentence should also be tagged as [IN].	The comment reflects frustration with the team's performance and play calling.   "We look just how we did last year" indicates the speaker is referring to their own team, as fans commonly use "we" to discuss their team's performance, especially when they are disappointed. "Terrible play calling" is a continuation of this frustration directed towards decisions made by their own team's coaching staff.  Given that the win probability is low at 26.3%, it makes sense that the commenter is expressing dissatisfaction with their in-group (the Vikings).  Therefore, "We" and "we" are tagged [IN] because they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports. The sentence "[SENT]" ("Terrible play calling") is an implicit reference to the team rather than the opposing team, so it should also be tagged [IN].	1663635663.0	vikings	eagles	624		3.0	0.26285341382026695	0.17600874577618764
test	rz96nq	hrudv84	t1_hrudho1	[OUT] Sabotage . 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 In the parent comment, there is a grievance about field conditions being poor, which typically suggests the commenter believes the conditions are benefiting the opponent. The word "Sabotage" implies that the opponent might be responsible for creating unfair conditions. Since the commenter supports the Chiefs and the opponent is the Broncos, the use of "Sabotage" implies an accusation toward the Broncos. There are no explicit mentions of the out-group, but it’s clear the comment targets the opponent (Broncos) implicitly. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged with [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The short, single-word comment 'Sabotage' conveys an accusatory tone that usually implies wrongdoing or foul play. Given the context that the parent comment is questioning the legality of the field conditions, the commenter is likely accusing the out-group (Broncos) of creating unfair playing conditions. Since this accusation is against the opposing team, '[SENT]' is tagged as [OUT] to indicate that the comment is referring to the out-group.	1641685818.0	chiefs	broncos	625	Pat "Kermit" Mahomes	1.0	0.612351596355438	0.7861900741157707

[IN] Trash 	['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (33, 39)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment is expressing frustration about the performance of the in-group team. 'Literally no resistance' and 'Trash' are negative remarks usually directed at one's own team when they are not performing well. Since it is highly unlikely that a fan would make such comments about the opposing team without qualifier, each sentence ('[SENT]') is implicitly referring to the in-group team's performance. Therefore, '[SENT]' in both sentences should be tagged with '[IN]'.	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 29.4% suggests that the in-group team (Chargers) is likely not performing well at this moment in the game. The comments 'Literally no resistance' and 'Trash' are expressions of frustration, typically directed at one's own team when they underperform. Since there are no explicit mentions of teams, players, or other specific entities within these sentences, the implicit subject is assumed to be the in-group team based on the negative tone and context. Therefore, both sentences '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN] to indicate the implicit reference to the in-group.	1632085199.0	chargers	cowboys	626	.	2.0	0.293787256166079	0.20040662213186175

['OUR']	[(27, 30)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The use of 'OUR' indicates a direct association with the team the commenter supports, which is the Patriots. The emotional response suggests disappointment or disbelief regarding the performance of their own player, further indicating an in-group reference. Hence, 'OUR' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the wide receiver of the in-group team, the Patriots.	EXPLANATION: The use of 'OUR' demonstrates that the commenter is referring to a player on the in-group team, the Patriots. The high win probability indicates that the team is performing well overall, so the comment might be expressing disbelief in a positive or slightly critical manner about their own wide receiver's performance. Therefore, 'OUR' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1638130509.0	patriots	titans	628		5.0	0.906679511070251	0.7497173011684886

['DPJ', 'our']	[(7, 10), (26, 29)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 DPJ refers to Donovan Peoples-Jones, a player for the Browns, which is the in-group team. Therefore, 'DPJ' should be tagged [IN]. The use of 'our' indicates possession or association with the speaker's team, which implies it is referring to the in-group. Consequently, 'our' should be tagged [IN] as well, since it refers to the Browns, the team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: DPJ refers to Donovan Peoples-Jones, a player for the Browns, which is the in-group team for the commenter. The use of "our" indicates the commenter is speaking as a fan of the Browns. Therefore, "DPJ" and "our" should both be tagged as [IN] since they refer to entities within the in-group team the commenter supports. The win probability being relatively high also suggests the commenter is optimistic about the in-group team's players, which supports the positive outlook for DPJ becoming WR1 (Wide Receiver 1) in two years. The second sentence does not contain any explicit mentions of the in-group, out-group, or other groups, so it is not tagged.	1632679956.0	browns	bears	629	:brownie-elf:	3.0	0.643208682537079	0.38886834319526625

The frustration expressed in "Dam" suggests that the commenter is disappointed by a missed interception, which is something fans typically express about their own team rather than the opponent. Therefore, "X - Men" is tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group (Giants), and the rest of the sentence contextually pertains to the in-group team's performance.	EXPLANATION: The phrase "X - Men" appears to be a nickname or a term of endearment for the in-group team, the Giants. This is a common practice among fans to use such terms for the team they support. The context of the comment suggests disappointment at missing an interception, which implies that it is the in-group team that missed the opportunity. Additionally, given the low win probability, it further suggests that the commenter is focused on the struggles or missed opportunities of the in-group team (Giants). Therefore, "X - Men" should be tagged as [IN].	1638728127.0	giants	dolphins	630		1.0	0.26828730106353804	0.07245703669298653

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The first sentence is about the commenter losing 1k, which strongly suggests a bet gone wrong, likely related to the Broncos, since commenters are more likely to bet on their own team. The subsequent sentences are about the personal consequences of this loss and don't refer to any specific team. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because the negative outcome (losing money) is implicitly related to the in-group team (Broncos) without directly mentioning them. The other sentences do not contain explicit or implicit references to any team and are tagged simply as '[SENT]'.	EXPLANATION: The commenter begins by mentioning the loss of money, which likely indicates a bet on the game. Since the win probability is 0.0%, it means the Broncos have certainly lost the game. Therefore, the comment about losing money is implicitly directed towards the in-group team (Broncos), who were likely the cause of the financial loss. The "[SENT]" tag for the first sentence is tagged [IN] due to the implicit reference to the Bronco's performance causing the commenter to lose the bet. Although the following sentences express frustration and personal circumstances, they stem from the same context of losing the bet due to the in-group team (Broncos) underperforming. Thus, the first sentence ("[SENT]") should be tagged [IN] as it implicitly refers to the in-group. The other sentences do not explicitly or implicitly mention the in-group or out-group, and thus do not have specific tags.	1665114416.0	broncos	colts	631		-2.0	0.0	1.0

There are no explicit mentions of the in-group or out-group teams (49ers or Chargers), but it's clear the commenter is talking about the performance pattern they prefer for their own team. This type of sentiment is typically directed towards one's own team. Therefore, the entire sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group team, thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	EXPLANATION: The commenter doesn't explicitly mention the in-group (49ers) or the out-group (Chargers) by name, but the sentiment expressed seems to be about the performance and strategy of their own team. The comment discusses preferring a poor first half with a strong finish (end-game defense) over a strong start and a collapse in the fourth quarter, which aligns with a fan's perspective on the in-group team. The win probability being relatively high suggests the in-group is performing well at the moment, which aligns with the notion of tightening down the defense in the end. Since there are no explicit mentions of team names, '[SENT]' is tagged as '[IN]' implicitly referring to the 49ers.	1668389525.0	49ers	chargers	632	:nickbosa: Nick Bosa	2.0	0.630330383777618	0.050577496274217586

['Cincinnati', 'Browns']	[(20, 30), (97, 103)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	In the first sentence, 'Cincinnati' refers to the city that is home to the Bengals, the out-group team. However, the comment uses it in a disparaging way, implying a joke about Ohio's IQ increasing if it sold Cincinnati to Kentucky. This is a sarcastic remark targeting the out-group, Bengals. In contrast, the second sentence, "Go Browns!" is a clear and explicit cheer for the in-group team. Thus, 'Cincinnati' should be tagged [IN], representing the disparaging remark about the out-group, and 'Browns' in "Go Browns!" should be tagged [IN] since it directly refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: 'Cincinnati' in the first sentence refers to the Cincinnati Bengals, which is the out-group opponent team, not the in-group. Therefore, it should be tagged [OUT] instead of [IN]. The second sentence contains 'Browns,' which is the in-group team the commenter supports; hence, 'Browns' should be tagged [IN] correctly. The correct tagging for this comment should be:  TARGET: [SENT] If Ohio sold [OUT] to Kentucky the average IQ of both states would go up . [SENT] Go [IN] !

train	xitesl	ip5au6z	t3_xitesl	[SENT] [OUT] needs an interception vaccine 	['Cousins']	[(7, 14)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter is discussing Kirk Cousins, who is the quarterback for the Vikings, the out-group team. The need for an "interception vaccine" is a critical remark, usually directed at an opponent or rival player's poor performance. Hence, 'Cousins' should be tagged with [OUT] since he belongs to the out-group team in this context.	Cousins is the quarterback for the Vikings, the out-group team in this context. The phrase "needs an interception vaccine" is a critical comment suggesting that Cousins is throwing too many interceptions, reflecting poorly on the out-group team. The in-group team's high win probability (97.8%) indicates they are performing well, likely contributing to the criticism towards the out-group leader. Thus, the name "Cousins" should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team the commenter opposes.	1663641110.0	eagles	vikings	634		5.0	0.978259682655334	0.7173524150268337

"this team" refers to the in-group team, the Raiders, as they are being evaluated and discussed critically by the commenter. Therefore, "this team" should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The phrase "this team" usually implies that the commenter is referring to the in-group team they support, which is the Raiders in this case. The very low win probability indicates the in-group team is not performing well overall, and the commenter is discussing internal matters by absolving the defense of the blame. This means "this team" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Raiders.	1671407866.0	raiders	patriots	635	:16:	1.0	0.152482450008392	0.8655103066867773
test	y5oxi4	islrcke	t1_islr5g6	[OUT] Remind me of the dark stl years lol 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter is referencing a period of struggle for the opponent team (Panthers), comparing it to tough times experienced by another team in a different city (St. Louis, which refers to the Rams' previous location). Because the context is about how bad the Panthers are, the comparison indicates the current struggling team, which is the out-group (Panthers). The entire sentence implicitly refers to the out-group's struggle without specifying any particular word or phrase explicitly indicating the out-group, thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]'.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is responding to a pessimistic prediction about the Panthers, the out-group team, finishing with very few wins. The comment "Remind me of the dark stl years lol" is an implied comparison between the Panthers' current bad season and past bad seasons experienced by the Rams when they were known as the St. Louis Rams. The extremely high win probability for the in-group suggests that they are likely doing well, which could lead the commenter to make a disparaging remark about the Panthers instead of their own team. The entire sentence implicitly refers to the out-group team's poor performance, thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]' since the sentiment is directed at the out-group.	1665960437.0	rams	panthers	14	LA Rams	3.0	0.995280802249908	0.9142265323415875

['reffing']	[(33, 40)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The comment is addressing the officiating of the game, which is typically neutral and should not be biased towards any specific team. The term "reffing" refers to the referees, who are a distinct entity and not part of either the in-group (Commanders) or the out-group (Cowboys). Thus, "reffing" is correctly tagged as [OTHER].	The commenter appears to be implying that the refereeing is biased or unfair. Referees are a neutral third party, and thus they are not considered part of either the in-group or out-group teams. Therefore, the word 'reffing' should be tagged as [OTHER], indicating an entity that is not aligned with either the Commanders or the Cowboys.	1639334833.0	commanders	cowboys	638	:WAS:	1.0	0.0444524554097218	0.21480115458627325

They are not part of either the in-group or out-group teams, nor do they belong to any other NFL team. Therefore, in this context, 'Refs' are tagged as [OTHER] because they form a distinct and neutral entity that does not align with either the in-group or out-group teams.	EXPLANATION: In American football, referees are generally considered neutral parties and not aligned with any specific team. Despite the common perception that officials might favor one team over another, they are officially neutral. With respect to the in-group and out-group teams (Browns and Bengals in this context), the term 'Refs' refers to another entity that is not either of these teams but rather an external factor influencing the game. Thus, 'Refs' should be tagged [OTHER] since it does not belong to either the in-group or out-group, and there is no other relevant club that 'Refs' could be associated with. The low win probability for the in-group (Browns) may contribute to feelings of frustration in the comment, but it does not change the neutral nature of the referees.	1670785204.0	browns	bengals	640		1.0	0.309428453445435	0.31034791965566716

['ridder']	[(11, 17)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is asking "ridder haters" (people who dislike Ridder) how they felt about a particular play, usually implying it was a good one to counter their criticism. Ridder is a player for the Falcons, who are the in-group team. Since the comment is defending Ridder against critics, it indicates support for an in-group player. Therefore, "ridder" should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is addressing "ridder haters," which implies that the commenter is defending a positive play by Desmond Ridder, the quarterback for the Falcons, who is the in-group team. Since the comment serves to challenge people who doubt Ridder's abilities, it is an implied praise for Ridder's performance, making the mention of Ridder implicitly supportive. Therefore, "ridder" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a player (Desmond Ridder) on the in-group team, the Falcons.	1673207059.0	falcons	buccaneers	641		3.0	0.56914234161377	0.6

The second sentence continues to talk about Robinson, hence 'him' and 'he' should also be tagged [IN] because they are referring to Robinson. 'The chiefs' refers to a different team in the NFL and not the out-group opponent (Dolphins), so 'the chiefs' should be tagged [OTHER].	The commenter talks about Robinson, a player for the Ravens, the in-group team they support, referring to him as a “great WR3.” This indicates high praise for an in-group player, so 'Robinson' is tagged [IN]. The second sentence explains why people underestimated Robinson, again referring to him in a positive light, which aligns with in-group bias. Thus 'him' and 'he' are also tagged [IN]. The third reference in the second sentence is 'the chiefs', which is another team in the NFL, not the opponent team, and so it is tagged [OTHER]. The high win probability suggests the in-group is performing well, which might influence positive comments about in-group players. Therefore, the tags [IN] for Robinson, him, and he, and [OTHER] for 'the chiefs' are appropriate for this context.	1663526411.0	ravens	dolphins	26		2.0	0.969357458874583	0.48860125260960335

['Hurts']	[(7, 12)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is likely discussing an opportunity for the in-group team, the Eagles, as Jalen Hurts is the quarterback for the Eagles. Since the comment mentions Hurts in the context of saving himself from criticism, this indicates a supportive perspective. Thus, 'Hurts' should be tagged [IN] because he is a player for the in-group team. The second sentence does not contain specific references to any entities but is generally about winning, which would be beneficial for the in-group, reinforcing that the context is about the Eagles.	EXPLANATION: Hurts is a player for the Eagles, the in-group team for the commenter. The win probability is relatively low for the Eagles, suggesting they are not doing well, so the comment refers to Hurts potentially turning the game around and saving himself from criticism, which fits with referencing an in-group player under pressure. Thus, 'Hurts' should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence does not contain an explicit reference to any specific entity but implies that winning games (which the Eagles aren't currently doing) makes people forget mistakes. This comment is more general and thus does not warrant a specific in/out/other tag in the absence of explicit mentions.	1638131969.0	eagles	giants	642	Greg Ward is bettter than Jerry Rice	8.0	0.24360626935958896	0.8874015000474699

Fans typically use 'us' to denote their own team, reflecting a sense of belonging and personal investment in the outcome. Therefore, 'us' should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to the team that the commenter supports. The rest of the sentence does not include any explicit references to either team, so only 'us' requires tagging.	Given the context of a live NFL game comment, "us" typically refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. In this case, the in-group is the Cardinals. Despite the low win probability of 7.7%, which suggests that the Cardinals are currently not doing well and are unlikely to win, the commenter has placed a $20 bet on "us" (the in-group) winning at halftime. This indicates optimism or hope despite the odds. The phrase "you never fucking know lmao" further reinforces this sense of uncertainty or hope against expectation. Therefore, "us" should be tagged as [IN] because it clearly refers to the in-group team, the Cardinals.	1663542347.0	cardinals	raiders	643		7.0	0.07721811532974199	0.7720115681233933

Since the commenter supports the Browns, 'Landry' is a member of the in-group. The compliment on his athletic ability ("with those hops") suggests pride and excitement, which a commenter would feel toward an in-group player. Therefore, 'Landry' should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: Jarvis Landry is a wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns, the in-group team. The comment praises Landry for his jumping ability ("with those hops"), which fans usually do for their own team's players. The relatively high win probability shows that the Browns are doing well, so the praise is consistent with their performance.

The use of 'they' and 'were' without specification suggests that the commenter is talking about their own team, the Vikings. Such critical language is often used by supporters to lament their team's performance. Therefore, both 'they' and 'were' should be tagged [IN] because they refer to the in-group team, the Vikings, with respect to the commenter.	The win probability is relatively low for the in-group team, the Vikings, which indicates that they are likely losing or in a difficult situation. The use of 'they' and 'were' shows that the commenter is talking about the team they support, as fans often use 'they' to refer to their own team in more exasperated or frustrated comments. The phrases 'panicked' and 'now were really fucked' suggest a negative assessment of the team's performance, which is consistent with a fan expressing frustration about the in-group team underperforming. Thus, 'they' and 'were' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the Vikings.	1671302246.0	vikings	colts	645	23	2.0	0.223206236958504	0.14459084604715672

The quietness of the apologists implies they have little to defend against critiques today, likely because the team is performing poorly. Therefore, "apologists" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The term 'apologists' is often used to describe fans or supporters who make excuses for their team. Given that the in-group team (Vikings) is not doing well right now, as indicated by the low win probability (25.1%), it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is referring to the in-group team's fans. Thus, 'apologists' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team's fans who are presumably quiet because the team is not performing well.	1671301888.0	vikings	colts	647		2.0	0.250696361064911	0.11976421636615811

[SENT] FLY CH[IN]LY 	['49ers', 'yal', 'ICKENS F']	[(7, 12), (29, 32), (51, 59)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter uses "49ers" to refer to a team that is neither the in-group (Eagles) nor the out-group (Chiefs), so it should be tagged as [OTHER]. "yal" is a colloquial way to address the in-group (Eagles), indicating the 49ers are better than the Eagles, thus it is tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "CHICKENS" refers to the Eagles in a mocking manner but still refers to the in-group team, so it should also be tagged [IN]. Therefore, '49ers', 'yal', and 'CHICKENS' are the correct referring expressions with the corresponding tags.	EXPLANATION: The commenter mentions '49ers', which is neither the in-group (Eagles) nor the out-group (Chiefs), thus it should be tagged as [OTHER]. The term 'yal' is a colloquial reference to 'you all', directed at the commenter’s in-group, the Eagles, hence it should be tagged [IN]. Even though the Eagles' win probability is 0%, indicating they have likely already lost, the commenter still refers to their team with 'FLY CHICKENS FLY', indicating support in a somewhat sarcastic or light-hearted manner. 'CHICKENS' in this context refers to the Eagles, since 'Fly Eagles Fly' is a common cheer for the team, and should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, '49ers' is tagged [OTHER], 'yal' is tagged [IN], and 'CHICKENS' is tagged [IN].	1676258098.0	eagles	chiefs	648		-9.0	0.0	1.0

Since the commenter supports the Dolphins, any direct reference to a player from their favorite team should be tagged as [IN]. Therefore, "Jaelan Philips" should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group. Additionally, the sentiment expressed in the comment ("is a mad lad") is positive, further indicating the reference is to a player the commenter supports (the in-group).	EXPLANATION: Jaelan Philips is a player for the Miami Dolphins, the in-group team that the commenter supports. The comment praises Jaelan Philips, referring to him as "a mad lad," which is a positive expression of admiration. Since the commenter's in-group team is the Dolphins and Jaelan Philips is part of that team, "Jaelan Philips" should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability is also quite high, which aligns with the positive nature of the comment, indicating that the in-group is likely performing well. Thus, the tag [IN] is correct for Jaelan Philips.	1671325340.0	dolphins	bills	649		4.0	0.769402518868446	0.0

[SENT] I do n’t like it 	['Offense']	[(41, 48)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment as a whole suggests frustration with the performance of the speaker's team, a sentiment more commonly directed at the in-group rather than the opponent. Specifically, the statement about the "Offense" getting up big and then stopping playing indicates a critical view of the speaker's team's offensive performance. It is unlikely that the speaker would express this kind of critique about the out-group team in this context, as fans typically focus these criticisms on the team they support. Thus, "Offense" is tagged as [IN], indicating it refers to the in-group, the Eagles, since the comment aligns with a pattern of expressing dissatisfaction with their own team's habits.	EXPLANATION: The comment is describing a recurring pattern where the offense of the in-group (Eagles) starts strong but then fails to maintain their performance. Given the high win probability, it suggests that the Eagles are likely leading at this point, but the commenter is frustrated with the team's behavior. Since there's frustration about the offense, and it's mentioned without qualification, it's reasonable to infer the commenter is talking about their own team. Therefore, ‘Offense’ should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team’s offense. The other sentences provide context but do not reference specific entities that need tagging.	1665973773.0	eagles	cowboys	650		14.0	0.892395563423634	0.7016487587995553

Since the commenter supports the Cowboys and wants to see Davis getting more opportunities, it is reasonable to assume that Davis is a player for the in-group team, the Cowboys. Therefore, 'Davis' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is likely a supporter of the Cowboys and is suggesting that Davis, a player on the Cowboys, should get some reps in the backfield. Since there is no mention of the out-group team (49ers) and it is a recommendation for a player on the in-group team, 'Davis' should be tagged with [IN]. The win probability indicates that the game is relatively balanced, so it's reasonable for the commenter to be thinking about making changes to improve the in-group's performance.	1674437628.0	cowboys	49ers	652	Tony Romo	4.0	0.444929361343384	0.617263695196427

[SENT] [IN] is a liability to [IN] 	['Daboll', 'this team']	[(140, 146), (165, 174)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is discussing players and coaches within the Bills organization. 'Josh' refers to Josh Allen, who is the quarterback for the Bills, thus the comment is centered around the in-group team. Similarly, 'Daboll' refers to Brian Daboll, who was the offensive coordinator for the Bills during the relevant period. The commenter is blaming Daboll, a member of the in-group, suggesting that he is 'a liability to this team.' Here, 'this team' refers to the in-group team (Bills). Thus, 'Daboll' and 'this team' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to entities within the in-group team.	The commenter is defending Josh, who is likely Josh Allen, the QB for the Bills. This indicates that the commenter supports the Bills, the in-group team. The second sentence also references Josh (implicitly Josh Allen) supporting the idea that the comments remain within the scope of the in-group. In the third sentence, the commenter criticizes Daboll, who is Brian Daboll, the offensive coordinator for the Bills, calling him a liability to 'this team,' which again is the Bills. This shows that the entire comment is about different elements of the in-group (Bills). Thus, 'Daboll' should be tagged [IN] because it's referring to an in-group sub-group member (the offensive coordinator of the Bills), and 'this team' should also be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.   EXPLANATION: 'Daboll' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to Brian Daboll, the offensive coordinator for the Bills, the in-group team. 'this team' also refers to the Bills, hence it should be tagged [IN] as well. The high win probability indicates the in-group team is doing well, which aligns with the commenter focusing on internal team dynamics rather than the opponent.	1635705381.0	bills	dolphins	653	:hamlin:	6.0	0.777003645896912	0.4911574155139205

['Bengals', 'Ben']	[(37, 44), (171, 174)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 3]	 In the comment, "Bengals" clearly refers to the out-group team, so it should be tagged [OUT]. "Ben" refers to Ben Roethlisberger, the quarterback for the in-group team, the Steelers, so it should be tagged [IN]. The phrase "They talked about it though" is a general statement without specific team reference, so it is not tagged. Similarly, "Even all that, at least TRY to get in the enzone" is a sentiment directed at Ben Roethlisberger, implicitly referring to the in-group, but "Ben" makes that explicit, so the tagging applies directly to his name.	The commenter is discussing the actions of both the in-group (Steelers) and the out-group (Bengals). The first sentence is analyzing a play where the out-group (Bengals) made a strategic defensive move, thus 'Bengals' should be tagged [OUT]. The second sentence is instructing 'Ben,' referencing Ben Roethlisberger, who is a player for the Steelers, to at least try to get in the end zone despite the circumstances. This reflects frustration with the in-group's execution. Therefore, 'Ben' should be tagged [IN]. Given the extremely low win probability, it is clear the Steelers are struggling, which aligns with the negative tone towards Ben's performance and the acknowledgment of the Bengals' defensive tactics. Thus 'Bengals' is tagged [OUT], and 'Ben' as [IN].	1632686433.0	steelers	bengals	655	:sc::c9::c0::sc: TJ Watt	1.0	0.0024522766470909	0.9808027923211169
train	pw4qlc	hefk1is	t3_pw4qlc	[IN] Fucking kidding me 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses frustration, which is often directed at the in-group team, especially during moments of disappointment or perceived underperformance. Since there is no explicit reference to a team or player, the frustration is implicitly directed at the in-group team (49ers). Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' indicating the comment refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: While the comment does not explicitly refer to a specific entity, the overall frustration expressed through "Fucking kidding me" implies that the commenter is reacting negatively to something that affected their in-group team (49ers). Given the win probability is nearly even, it suggests the game could be close, potentially heightening the commenter's emotional investment in the in-group team's performance. Thus, the comment implicitly refers to the 49ers' situation, and the sentence should be tagged [IN] despite the absence of explicit references.	1632713363.0	49ers	packers	656	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	1.0	0.49410492181778	0.9947676481021639

"Kupp" refers to Cooper Kupp, a prominent player for the Rams, thus he’s tagged as [IN]. The frustration about the 49ers player tackling the Rams player before the ball got there reinforces the in-group perspective. - In the third sentence, the commenter praises the offensive line (oline), and since the commenter supports the Rams, the praise is directed towards the Rams' offensive line, thus it is tagged as "[IN] Love the push [IN] is getting right now". Hence, ‘PI’, ‘Warner’, ‘Kupp’, ‘the oline’ are correctly tagged as referring expressions in this context.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is supporting the Rams, indicated by the in-group and out-group information. The first sentence is stating that there should have been pass interference (PI), which the commenter believes should have been called in favor of the in-group team (Rams), thus 'PI' is tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, Warner, a player from the out-group (49ers), is mentioned as tackling Kupp, a player from the in-group (Rams), so 'Warner' is tagged [OUT] and 'Kupp' is tagged [IN]. In the third sentence, the commenter expresses satisfaction with the offensive line, which is part of the in-group team (Rams), thus 'the oline' is tagged [IN]. Therefore, the referring expressions and their corresponding tags are correct in the given context.	1664845929.0	rams	49ers	657		9.0	0.41230931878089905	0.34001804873157526
train	y5f3jf	islnvsc	t3_y5f3jf	[IN] Holy shit how do you miss that hold ?? 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[4]	 The comment expresses frustration about a missed holding call. It is highly likely that this frustration is directed toward a missed penalty that would have favored the commenter’s team, the Bills. Fans typically get angry when calls that could benefit their team are missed. Since there is no explicit reference to either team, the entire sentiment is related to the in-group, thus '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]'. This reflects the implicit reference to the in-group team in the context of the comment.	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely expressing frustration about a missed holding call against the in-group team, which is the Bills. Given the in-group's high win probability, the commenter is probably focusing on a specific play that did not go in favor of the Bills, even though they are in a strong position overall. Since there is no explicit reference to the Bills or the Chiefs, the sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] because the context suggests the frustration is about a negative event (missed holding) affecting the in-group team.	1665958882.0	bills	chiefs	658	:17-shorts:	2.0	0.991523027420044	0.6124372412578173

Since the comment praises Mike Hughes ('a curse to be reckoned with'), it is consistent with cheering for the in-group team. Therefore, 'Mike Hughes' should be tagged [IN] because he is a member of the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is praising Mike Hughes, and since the in-group team (Chiefs) has a high win probability right now, it is very likely that Mike Hughes is a player on the in-group team. Fans of a team typically praise their own players and use positive language when the team is doing well. Therefore, 'Mike Hughes' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a player on the in-group (Chiefs).	1636943605.0	chiefs	raiders	659	Tyler Thigpen #4	2.0	0.8487372859550439	0.39542027366657356

The phrase "7 game winning streak" also refers to the Patriots, so "they" refers to the in-group as well and should be tagged [IN]. The commenter seems to be degrading the quality of the teams that the Patriots beat during their winning streak, and mentions the "Titans" as the only possibly strong team, which is neither the in-group nor the out-group. Therefore, "Titans" should be tagged as [OTHER]. The rest of the comment complains about the other teams' quality without explicitly naming them, hence remaining tags directly related to the quality of opponents should not have any team-specific tags.	EXPLANATION: The first sentence talks about "this defense" being good during a 7 game winning streak, which indicates the in-group team, the Patriots, since the commenter is questioning the quality of their defense despite their previous winning streak. Thus, "this defense" and "they" should be tagged [IN] as they clearly refer to the in-group. The third sentence mentions "Titans," which is another NFL team that is neither the in-group (Patriots) nor the out-group (Bills), so it should be tagged as [OTHER]. The overall win probability for the Patriots is low, which could explain the critical tone of the comment.	1640548678.0	patriots	bills	660		2.0	0.130024254322052	0.6002947295423023

['Pats', 'our D']	[(7, 11), (106, 111)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The first sentence refers to the Patriots (out-group), who are described as doing a good job, indicating respect for the opponent's performance. Thus, "Pats" should be tagged with [OUT]. The second sentence expresses a hope that the in-group team's defense will respond to the out-group's good performance, hence "our D" should be tagged with [IN], as it refers to the defense of the in-group team, the Bills.	EXPLANATION: The commenter mentions 'Pats' which is a nickname for the Patriots, the out-group team. Therefore, 'Pats' should be tagged [OUT]. In the second sentence, 'our D' refers to the in-group team, the Bills, and their defense. The use of 'our' indicates the commenter is talking about their own team, hence 'our D' should be tagged [IN]. The win probability is fairly high for the in-group, which might be why the commenter hopes that their defense ('our D') will come up with an answer to the out-group's effective plays. Thus, '[IN]' and '[OUT]' are the correct tags.	1673205378.0	bills	patriots	662	:wagon:	3.0	0.704566299915314	0.39196293326205117

"the pats" refers to the Patriots, who are the opponent team in this context, and thus it is tagged [OUT]. The comparison made between the in-group and out-group performance further supports this tagging.	EXPLANATION: The commenter uses "our running game" to refer to the in-group team, the Buccaneers, as the possessive pronoun "our" indicates that they are talking about their own team. It implies a sense of ownership and support, which is consistent with the in-group identification. The phrase "the pats" clearly denotes the out-group team, the Patriots, as it is a common shorthand for the New England Patriots. Even though the win probability for the in-group is high, the commenter is focusing on a specific aspect of the game (running game effectiveness) and comparing it to the opponent's performance in the same area. Therefore, "our running game" should be tagged [IN] and "the pats" should be tagged [OUT].	1633315449.0	buccaneers	patriots	663		1.0	0.809363827109337	0.7224017690083347
train	rl1zws	hpdm83t	t3_rl1zws	[SENT] [IN] looks great 	['Graham']	[(7, 13)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment "Graham looks great" is likely referring to a player that the commenter supports, since expressing approval or praise ('looks great') typically indicates favor toward an in-group member. Given the commenter supports the Bears, 'Graham' is most likely a Bears player, thus 'Graham' should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: Despite the low win probability for the Bears, the commenter is providing a positive assessment of Graham. Since there is no context suggesting otherwise, it is reasonable to assume that the positive comment is referring to a player from the in-group team (the Bears) rather than the out-group (the Vikings). With American football fandom, it is common for fans to highlight the positive performances of their own team's players even in the face of a probable loss. Therefore, 'Graham' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a Bears player (the in-group).	1640055528.0	bears	vikings	664		3.0	0.136434674263001	0.5594980137233658

['our offense']	[(31, 42)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The phrase "our offense" indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group team they support, which is the Steelers. Fans typically use possessive terms like "our" to talk about their own team. Therefore, "our offense" should be tagged with [IN]. The rest of the sentence and the next sentence do not contain explicit references to either team, so they are not tagged here. The full first sentence contextually implies a focus on the in-group, reinforcing this tagging decision.	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'our offense' suggests that the commenter is referring to the in-group team (Steelers), as fans typically use 'our' to denote their own team's units. Additionally, given the win probability being slightly in favor of the in-group, it implies the commenter has some confidence in the team's ability to perform well. Therefore, 'our offense' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. The rest of the sentences relate to this unit's potential for gaining yards and scoring a touchdown, thus indirectly referring to the in-group without using specific words in the second sentence.	1668369825.0	steelers	saints	665	:sh::h2::h6::sh:Woodson	8.0	0.55836609005928	0.7127055599060298

The suggestion to start warming up "Keenum" refers to Case Keenum, a player for the Bills. It implies that the current quarterback situation is not ideal, expressing concern about the in-group team. Therefore, "Keenum" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team. The in-group team is the Bills, evidenced by the context involving their coach and quarterback.	EXPLANATION: The comment refers to 'coach McDermott', who is the head coach of the Bills, the in-group team. The suggestion to start warming up 'Keenum' is about Case Keenum, who is a backup quarterback for the Bills. Despite the extremely high win probability, the commenter seems to be suggesting a quarterback change, which is minor criticism typical when fans discuss their team’s strategy. Therefore, 'Keenum' should be tagged as [IN] because he is a part of the in-group team. The rest of the sentences are implicit statements referring to the in-group in suggesting team changes, and hence '[SENT]' tags are not explicitly required.	1665339089.0	bills	steelers	666		5.0	0.985941959545016	0.36423550087873463

['his', 'we']	[(116, 119), (167, 169)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 In the parent comment, the suggestion is to bench Lamar (likely Lamar Jackson, the Ravens' quarterback), indicating this conversation is about the Ravens' performance. In the first sentence, there is no explicit reference to any team or player. In the second sentence, 'his confidence' refers implicitly to Lamar Jackson, who is part of the in-group (Ravens). 'we' is a pronoun that supporters typically use to refer to their own team, which in this context is the Ravens. Therefore, 'his' and 'we' should be tagged [IN] since they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports. The comment reflects concerns from a fan perspective, discussing Ravens' internal issues and potential solutions.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment mentions benching Lamar, who is the quarterback for the Ravens, the in-group team. This sets the context for discussing Lamar's performance and the team's decisions. 'His' in the second sentence refers to Lamar, thus it should be tagged [IN]. The use of 'we' in sports contexts almost always refers to the in-group team from the perspective of the commenter. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] as it signifies the in-group team. The low win probability suggests that the in-group is struggling, which aligns with the discussion about needing fresh perspectives, thus further supporting the tagging of 'his' and 'we' as [IN].	1666918584.0	ravens	buccaneers	667		0.0	0.17400272190570798	0.21743772241992881

The phrase 'our defense' is used, which clearly refers to the team that the commenter supports, in this case, the Colts. The usage of 'we' and 'our' implies belongingness and support, which is characteristic of an in-group reference.  Therefore, the phrase 'our defense' should be tagged [IN], and '[SENT]' does not need to be explicitly tagged because the tagging of 'our defense' captures the sentiment of the entire sentence referring to the in-group.  The commenter uses the phrase 'our defense,' indicating their support for the in-group team, which is the Colts. Using 'we' and 'our' signals the commenter's association with the team they are rooting for. Hence, 'our defense' is correctly tagged as [IN].	The phrase 'our defense' signifies the in-group team as it reflects a sense of ownership and support. Given that the commenter supports the Colts, 'our defense' refers to the Colts' defense. Additionally, the phrase 'we need a big turnover' implies that the commenter is talking about what their own team needs, further confirming that 'our defense' is the Colts' defense. Hence, 'our defense' should be tagged with [IN].	1641757144.0	colts	jaguars	668		2.0	0.456652075052261	0.5249750702565498
train	rp4yh9	hq2pv5t	t3_rp4yh9	[SENT] Fire [IN] . 	['Tomlin']	[(12, 18)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment 'Fire Tomlin' indicates frustration towards a coach, specifically Mike Tomlin, who is the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Steelers, any mention of Tomlin refers to an entity within the in-group. The expressed desire to fire him reflects displeasure with the in-group's performance. Therefore, 'Tomlin' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a key member of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The extremely low win probability indicates that the in-group team, the Steelers, is performing poorly in the game. 'Tomlin' refers to Mike Tomlin, the head coach of the Steelers. The use of 'Fire' before 'Tomlin' suggests frustration from the commenter towards the in-group team's coach for their poor performance. Therefore, 'Tomlin' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team.	1640557785.0	steelers	chiefs	669	:sc::c9::c0::sc: TJ Watt	-4.0	0.006390333175658958	0.3620657276995305

Since the commenter supports the Jaguars, the Titans, who are the opponent, should be tagged as [OUT]. The phrase "the Titans" explicitly refers to the out-group opponent team and is correctly tagged with [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment is sarcastically congratulating whichever team has the opportunity to play against the Titans, presumably suggesting that the Titans will be an easy opponent in the wildcard playoff. Given that the in-group team for the commenter is the Jaguars, 'the Titans' clearly refers to the out-group opponent team, as indicated by the win probability which shows the in-group is currently losing and thus likely has some frustration towards the opponent. Therefore, 'the Titans' should be tagged with [OUT].	1673149937.0	jaguars	titans	670	Spooky Jag	2.0	0.287532925605774	0.9064186584425598

[SENT] Figure out [IN] bro 	['Mlf', 'your offense']	[(7, 10), (54, 66)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[4, 4]	 The commenter is criticizing 'Mlf,' which likely refers to Matt LaFleur, the head coach of the Packers. Fans typically refer to their own team's coach by shorthand or nickname, indicating that 'Mlf' is related to the in-group. The second sentence advises someone to "Figure out your offense," which implies they are addressing a member of the in-group (presumably the coach or players). Therefore, 'Mlf' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the Packers' head coach, and 'your offense' should also be tagged [IN] because it pertains to the Packers' performance.	EXPLANATION: 'Mlf' likely refers to Matt LaFleur, the head coach of the Packers, the in-group team. The commenter appears to be frustrated with his strategies and decisions in the game, indicating that the criticism is directed at the leader of the in-group. Consequently, 'Mlf' should be tagged as [IN]. The phrase “your offense” is directed at 'Mlf,' who is responsible for managing the Packers' offense, thus it also refers to the in-group. Therefore, “your offense” should be tagged with [IN] as well. Even though the in-group win probability is slightly above average, critics from fans can still arise due to in-game decisions.	1636930000.0	packers	seahawks	26		1.0	0.581571489572525	0.4460497439648866

Since the commenter supports the Packers, 'Aaron' refers to a key player from the in-group, and 'you' (which directly addresses Aaron) should also be tagged as [IN]. Similarly, 'a tightly covered rookie' is part of the Packers' team, so it should be tagged as [IN]. The comment is critical of the decision-making of an in-group player, which implies that the critique is directed within the in-group rather than the out-group. Hence, the entire comment refers to in-group individuals.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is likely addressing Aaron Rodgers, the quarterback for the Packers (in-group), given that 'Aaron' and 'you' are used without any further qualification. The criticism about not taking advantage of an opportunity ('you had ten yards of free space to run and slide') indicates they are frustrated with their own team, the Packers. The phrase 'a tightly covered rookie' also implies the rookie is a member of the in-group since the conversation revolves around the actions of Aaron Rodgers and his team. Hence, 'Aaron,' 'you,' and 'a tightly covered rookie' should be tagged with [IN]. The win probability of 70.0% further supports that the Packers are performing relatively well overall, which aligns with the critical yet hopeful tone of a supporter.	1665942042.0	packers	jets	671		4.0	0.700320065021515	0.20771110507738258

['the defense', 'tua']	[(32, 43), (61, 64)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The first sentence refers to a defensive failure, and since there's no mention of any team other than the in-group or out-group, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is referring to their own team's defense (the Ravens). Thus, "the defense" should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence mentions Tua, a player for the out-group team (the Dolphins), expressing disbelief that his performance will be repeated, indicating that "tua" should be tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'the defense' typically refers to the in-group unless specified otherwise, and given that the win probability is 0.0% for the in-group Ravens, it suggests that they have blown the game, supporting that 'the defense' refers to the Ravens' defense. The second sentence mentions 'tua,' a known player for the Dolphins, thus referring to the out-group. Therefore, 'the defense' is tagged with [IN] and 'tua' with [OUT].	1663532683.0	ravens	dolphins	672		6.0	0.0	1.0

'Jags' refers to the Jacksonville Jaguars, which is neither the in-group (Jets) nor the out-group (Patriots), but another team in the NFL. Therefore, 'Jags' should be tagged with [OTHER] since it refers to a team that is not the in-group or the out-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is referring to the Jaguars (Jags) in response to a question about which team is competing for being the worst in the NFL. Since the Jaguars are neither the in-group (Jets) nor the out-group (Patriots), they fall into the category of "other" teams in the NFL. Therefore, "Jags" should be tagged as [OTHER].	1632080264.0	jets	patriots	26		10.0	0.0017824806272983	0.8718140929535232

test	ybpxas	itimcfy	t3_ybpxas	[SENT] Hell ... [SENT] Let [IN] play offense also lol 	['the defense']	[(27, 38)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is lamenting about the state of the game by suggesting that their own defensive players should also play on offense, which implies that they are frustrated with their team’s performance, specifically the offensive side. Since 'the defense' has no qualification and the suggestion comes with a tone of wanting to change something within their own team, 'the defense' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team (Broncos) that the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing frustration about the current offensive performance. By suggesting that the defense play offense, the commenter is implicitly stating that the defense is performing better than the offense. Since 'the defense' is mentioned without any qualification and it is the in-group (Broncos) that the commenter supports, the term 'the defense' refers to the Broncos' defense. The implicit comparison here is about the in-group team's situation, especially given their low win probability. Therefore, 'the defense' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, the Broncos.	1666564132.0	broncos	jets	674		2.0	0.368844032287598	0.7247869018482572
train	xhiyv4	ioyzdri	t3_xhiyv4	[IN] On the brightside , first pick here we come 😂 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment appears to be lamenting the performance of the in-group team, implying that their poor record might get them the first pick in the draft. Since fans typically express such sentiments about their own team rather than the opponent, this comment is implicitly about the in-group team (Panthers in this case). Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as the entire sentiment is directed towards the in-group team even though no specific word or phrase explicitly mentions the team.	EXPLANATION: Despite the extremely high win probability, the comment appears to sarcastically imply that the team is in a poor position for the season and may end up with a high draft pick, which is typically given to the worst teams in the league. This indicates a certain level of underperformance or undesired outcomes more generally throughout the season, even if the specific game is going well. The implicit reference here is about the in-group team's season performance, hence '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN] to denote that the comment is referring to the in-group (Panthers) in a broader context.	1663531426.0	panthers	giants	675		5.0	1.0	1.0

Since JFields is part of the in-group (Bears), any reference to him such as 'JFields', 'He', 'he', and 'him' should be tagged with [IN]. This context shows admiration and positive expectations, which aligns with supporter language. Thus, 'JFields', 'He', 'he', and 'him' are correctly tagged as [IN]. The sentence '[SENT] No it 's not .' has no explicit referring expressions for in-group or out-group, matching the target correctly.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is defending Justin Fields, who is a quarterback for the Bears, the in-group team. They are emphasizing his talent and athleticism, indicating a strong support for him, which aligns with being a fan of the Bears. Despite the low win probability, fans tend to focus on the potential and positives of their players. 'JFields', 'He', 'he', and 'him' all refer to Justin Fields, thus they should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to a member of the in-group. The sentences that feature these mentions implicitly support the in-group team as well, reinforcing why these pronouns and names are tagged as [IN].	1635709152.0	bears	49ers	26		1.0	0.196590900421143	0.8625561978163134

Furthermore, the phrase 'thank you for making them cry' refers to making the out-group team (Eagles) cry since the commenter is expressing gratitude in a context that is common among fans when the opponent (out-group) is defeated. Thus, 'them' should be tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is identifying themselves as a fan of the "49ers," which is a team not involved in the current game (Chiefs vs. Eagles). Hence, "49er" is tagged [OTHER]. The phrase "making them cry" refers to the Eagles, who are the opponent team and are unhappy about losing, hence "them" is tagged [OUT]. The win probability of 0% for the in-group (Chiefs) indicates they will certainly lose, so the commenter (a 49ers fan) is congratulating the Chiefs (despite the loss) for causing distress to the Eagles. The sentences implicitly refer to the in-group's efforts, but there are no direct references to the Chiefs in the extracted phrases.	1676258237.0	chiefs	eagles	677		6.0	0.0	1.0

['[SENT]', 'Samuel']	[(0, 6), (44, 50)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[3, 5]	 The two sentences form part of an ongoing commentary on events happening in real-time during the game. In the first sentence, "That’s a grown man hit" does not contain specific entities or players' names, but it is likely a general statement referring to a play involving the in-group (Commanders). Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence mentions "Samuel," who is Curtis Samuel, a player for the Commanders. Therefore, "Samuel" is tagged as [IN] because he belongs to the in-group. This results in '[SENT]' in the first sentence being tagged [IN] due to the general nature hinting at an in-group event, and "Samuel" being tagged [IN] in the second sentence.	The low win probability indicates that the Commanders (in-group) are currently losing against the Lions (out-group). With this in mind, it is reasonable to interpret that the commenter is focusing on moments of positive performance by the in-group. The phrase "That’s a grown man hit" lacks a specific entity reference but implies recognition of a commendable play (likely by the in-group given the focus on the Commanders' positive aspects). Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence specifies "Samuel," a player for the Commanders, making a significant play ("growner man TD"), which reinforces the in-group context. Thus, "Samuel" should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, the correct tagged output and referring expressions are as provided, with the in-group being the focus due to the commendable plays mentioned.	1663527079.0	commanders	lions	678	:WAS:	5.0	0.12016355991363503	0.587132816723734
test	rk1pag	hp7hg3q	t3_rk1pag	[SENT] [OTHER] do n't need to cheat us like that 	['They']	[(7, 11)]	['[OTHER]']	[3]	 The target word "They" in the comment is ambiguous and could refer to a general entity or another team in the NFL, not necessarily the out-group team (Bills). Since it is not explicitly identified as referring to the out-group team and could be a general reference, it is safest to tag "They" as [OTHER]. The word "us" implicitly refers to the in-group (Panthers), although not explicitly highlighted in the target expression. Therefore, "They" should be tagged with [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely referring to the game officials or referees rather than a specific team. In sports, "cheating" often implies controversial or bad calls from officials. Since officials are neither part of the in-group nor the out-group, the word "They" should be tagged as [OTHER]. Meanwhile, "us" clearly refers to the Panthers, the in-group, but since it was not specified to be tagged, we focus on the explicit tag provided. Thus, "They" is correctly tagged as [OTHER].	1639944659.0	panthers	bills	679	Purrbaca	7.0	0.031236231327056996	0.6748751204977653

Fans typically discuss their own team’s players when making requests or expressing wishes for changes. Thus, 'Allen' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The low win probability indicates that the in-group team, the Commanders, are not doing well, which aligns with a request to bring back a key player. "Allen" likely refers to Jonathan Allen, a defensive player for the Commanders. The phrase "Bring Allen back pls" suggests that the commenter believes his return is crucial for improving their team's performance. Therefore, "Allen" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team.	1639335392.0	commanders	cowboys	681	:99:	0.0	0.0339053124189377	0.2596215522771007

['OBJ']	[(46, 49)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 Odell Beckham Jr. (OBJ) is a well-known player in the NFL who is not part of the Jets or the Colts. The comment humorously remarks that a character in a Bud Light Seltzer ad resembles OBJ, suggesting he has "let himself go." Since OBJ is not a player on either the in-group (Jets) or the out-group (Colts) team, he should be tagged as [OTHER]. The referring expression 'OBJ' should be tagged [OTHER] because it refers to an entity that is neither part of the in-group nor the out-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment references an advertisement featuring OBJ (Odell Beckham Jr.), who is not playing in the Jets vs. Colts game. OBJ is a widely known player who has played for other NFL teams such as the Giants, Browns, and Rams, but he is not relevant to the current game. Consequently, the reference to OBJ should be tagged as [OTHER] since he does not belong to either the in-group team (Jets) or the out-group opponent team (Colts). This makes "[OTHER]" the correct tag for "OBJ."	1636073745.0	jets	colts	682	:CoachSaleh2:	2.0	0.170407652854919	0.17414408920637686

The criticism of his play-calling as predictable and embarrassing implies the commenter is discussing the in-group team they support. Therefore, 'Romans' is tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group's offensive coordinator.	EXPLANATION: The comment is criticizing Roman's play calling, which suggests that Roman is the offensive coordinator for the Ravens, the in-group team that the commenter supports. Given the very low win probability, it is reasonable to suppose the commenter is frustrated with their own team's performance and coaching decisions. Therefore, 'Romans' should be tagged with [IN] since he is part of the in-group.	1673204016.0	ravens	bengals	683	 :PBIRD:	19.0	0.027870457619428968	0.25294020208712936

'refs' is tagged as [OTHER] because referees are neither part of the in-group (Chargers) nor the out-group (Chiefs), but are seen as a neutral or other entity responsible for officiating. 2. 'the Chiefs' is tagged as [OUT] because it directly refers to the out-group team. 3. 'they' is also tagged as [OTHER] because it is a pronoun referring back to 'refs', which has been tagged as [OTHER]. 4. 'em' is tagged as [OUT] since it is a colloquial contraction of 'them', which in this context refers to the Chiefs, the out-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment is from a Chargers fan discussing perceived favoritism by referees towards the Chiefs. 'refs' should be tagged as [OTHER] because referees are neutral entities and not part of either team. 'the Chiefs' and 'em' refer to the Chiefs, the out-group team, hence they are tagged [OUT]. 'they' refers back to 'refs', so it is tagged as [OTHER]. The overall tone of the comment indicates frustration with the referees benefiting the opponent team, thus the tags accurately reflect the entities involved.	1663293930.0	chargers	chiefs	626	.	17.0	0.602249544235008	0.6188235294117647

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 Greg Coleman is a former player for the Minnesota Vikings who later became a radio broadcaster for the team. "Atta boy cookie" is likely a phrase used by Coleman in his commentary, and mentioning it could signal a positive action by Dalvin Cook, a current Vikings player. Therefore, the comment implicitly praises an in-group player or action without explicitly stating it. Since the sentiment indicates support for the Vikings, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to denote that the comment is referring to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment is referencing Greg Coleman, a well-known former Vikings player and current media personality associated with the team. The phrase "atta boy cookie" is likely praise for a Vikings player, signifying a positive play or effort. Given the high win probability of 86.2%, it is consistent with the commenter being pleased with the in-group team's performance. Even though there are no explicit references to the in-group, the context strongly suggests it's about the Vikings, making the entire sentence implicitly about the in-group. Thus '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]'.	1662932306.0	vikings	packers	686	72	4.0	0.862082123756409	0.401489381263216
train	zcg5fy	iywvi01	t3_zcg5fy	[IN] LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is expressing extreme excitement and enthusiasm, which is usually indicative of something positive happening for the in-group team. Since there are no explicit words or phrases that refer to the in-group or out-group, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Eagles, as the commenter is likely celebrating a successful play or event in favor of their supported team. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	EXPLANATION: The phrase "LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO" is a strong expression of excitement and encouragement. Given that the win probability at the time of the comment is very high (96.7%) for the in-group (Eagles), it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is celebrating a positive event for the Eagles. The absence of explicit names or terms means that the sole sentence '[SENT]' is referring to the in-group implicitly, signifying excitement about an event favoring the team the commenter supports, hence it should be tagged as [IN].	1670184392.0	eagles	titans	687	JHURTS	1.0	0.967464080242568	0.6605781166873559

This kind of detailed advice or critique is more likely to be directed towards the in-group rather than the out-group because fans generally focus on the performance and improvement of their own team. There are no explicit mentions of specific players or teams, but since the intent is to discuss strategy and improvement, it can be inferred that the commenter is talking about the in-group team (Eagles). Thus, the entire sentence should be tagged with [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group team without explicitly naming any entities.	The parent comment and the high win probability suggest that the in-group team, the Eagles, is in a favorable position. The comment seems to be addressing the in-group, advising that even when blitzed (a defensive play where multiple defenders rush towards the quarterback), they still have the option to throw the ball. This advice or reminder typically indicates a vested interest in the in-group team's strategy, especially given the context (responding to a comment about being blitzed). Hence, the entire sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group's situation and actions. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment is indirectly about the in-group, even though it does not explicitly mention the in-group team or players.	1635706627.0	eagles	lions	688	lemme axe you a Queztion	1.0	0.995658440515399	0.6775247524752476

[SENT] &#x200B ; [IN] needs to go though . [SENT] It 's been real and it's been fun , but it ain't working anymore I 'm afraid . 	['they', 'the offense', 'Lambo']	[(55, 59), (139, 150), (173, 178)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The first sentence is discussing the hypothetical situation where a running back who gained 1400 yards last season is more involved in the offense. 'they' and 'the offense' are referring to the in-group, Jaguars, as the commenter is reflecting on their team's performance. The name 'Lambo' in the second sentence refers to Josh Lambo, a kicker for the Jaguars, indicating that he should be tagged with [IN] as well. Hence, 'they', 'the offense', and 'Lambo' are correctly tagged as [IN]. The third sentence expresses general disappointment without specific references, but it follows the prior sentences focused on the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the in-group Jaguars is relatively high at 74.3%, indicating they are likely doing well at this point in time. The first sentence uses 'they,' which typically refers implicitly to the in-group (Jaguars) when not specified otherwise. This is reinforced by the comment about getting a running back more involved in 'the offense,' which also implies the Jaguars since fans usually discuss their own team's strategies. Therefore, 'they' and 'the offense' should be tagged as [IN].  'Lambo' in the second sentence refers to Josh Lambo, who is a former kicker for the Jaguars. The commenter is expressing frustration with his performance, suggesting the need for a change. Hence, 'Lambo' should be tagged as [IN] since he is a player on the in-group team.  The remaining part of the comment reflects the commenter's general disappointment about something that isn’t working, which contextually still ties back to the in-group team’s performance or situation. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since it is implicitly referring to the in-group. This understanding provides the basis for the correct tagging of the comment and list of referring expressions.	1632683328.0	jaguars	cardinals	689	Jaxson de Ville :JaxsondeVille:	3.0	0.742808137584356	0.695959595959596

train	pmzxdh	hcm1qm7	t3_pmzxdh	[OUT] This is gonna be a checkdown that goes for 10 + 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	[3]	 The commenter is anticipating a successful play (a checkdown for more than 10 yards) from the opponent, usually indicating a pessimistic or realistic view of their own defense. Since it is a positive prediction about a play being made, it refers implicitly to the out-group team (Saints), who are expected to gain positive yardage. Thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]' since there is no explicit word/phrase that refers to the out-group, but the comment is implicitly referring to the out-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely pessimistic about a play and assumes that the Saints will successfully execute a long gain through a checkdown pass. Given that the win probability for the Packers is low (32.4%), it is reasonable to infer that the commenter expects a successful play by the out-group opponent, the Saints. The sentence does not explicitly mention any team or player, but the context suggests that it refers to the out-group due to the expectation of a positive outcome for the Saints. Thus, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged as [OUT].	1631481162.0	packers	saints	691	:GB:	10.0	0.32443046569824197	0.27740096333431635

[IN] [SENT] Oh fuck me why did I say anything lmao 	['aj brown']	[(24, 32)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 AJ Brown is a player for the Eagles, the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'aj brown' is tagged with [IN] since it directly refers to a player from the in-group team. The rest of the comment does not have explicit references to any team or player. The exclamation in the second sentence suggests it was an in-the-moment reaction, not aimed at referring to any other team, so it remains untagged here. The first sentence refers implicitly to the in-group, indicated by the mention of AJ Brown, hence it is also tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is an Eagles fan, and "aj brown" is a reference to A.J. Brown, a player on the Eagles, which is why it should be tagged [IN]. The high win probability suggests that the Eagles are doing well, supporting the idea that the commenter is referring to an in-group player positively. The first sentence implies confidence in A.J. Brown (an Eagles player) during a critical moment, which later seems to backfire, leading to the self-deprecating second sentence. Thus, "aj brown" is tagged with [IN], and there are no explicit references to other entities in the second sentence.	1665347762.0	eagles	cardinals	692		4.0	0.8361078500747681	0.061548834521286844

The mention of his "easy drop of the game" indicates a mistake made by Njoku, whom the commenter is likely frustrated with, but the context clearly indicates that the commenter is referring to an in-group player. Therefore, 'Njoku' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team (Browns).	EXPLANATION: Njoku is a player for the Browns, and the in-group team the commenter supports is the Browns. The comment is lamenting an easy drop made by Njoku, indicating frustration with the performance of the in-group player. Despite the high win probability, fans often still focus on individual plays and errors. Therefore, 'Njoku' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1663527579.0	browns	jets	629	:brownie-elf:	2.0	0.992837488651276	0.6220193245279674

['this D', 'our O']	[(10, 16), (78, 83)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is likely a Jets fan, discussing both the defense ('D') and offense ('O') of their own team. 'this D' is used positively, suggesting the defense can be "legit," which an in-group fan would say about their own team. Similarly, 'our O' refers to the offense and uses 'our,' indicating ownership or affiliation with the in-group team. Thus, these phrases should be tagged with [IN] as they both refer to aspects of the Jets team, in-group for the commenter.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing both the defensive and offensive units of a team. Since there is no parent comment and no mention of another team, it is reasonable to assume that "this D" (defense) and "our O" (offense) refer to the in-group team, the Jets. The usage of "our" further reinforces this as it implies possession or belonging, which fans typically use when referring to their own team. The low win probability indicates that the team isn't doing well overall, adding context to why the commenter would say that the offense isn't helping much. Therefore, "this D" and "our O" should be tagged as [IN]. The sentences themselves ("ok this D can be legit." and "which is good bc it doesn't look like our O is gonna help them much this year.") also reflect a focus on the in-group unit, hence the tagging of entities with [IN].	1632073985.0	jets	patriots	693	:Retired_Mangold: Nick Mangold	3.0	0.196200966835022	0.283452023988006

Therefore, "D" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The high win probability indicates that the in-group team, the 49ers, is likely performing well. The comment "Helluva D" is a common expression of admiration for the defense, which is typically reflective of the in-group team when no other team is specified. Therefore, "D" should be tagged as [IN], referring to the 49ers' defense. This explains why the tag [IN] is applied and why "D" is the correct referring expression.	1662918568.0	49ers	bears	694	:jerseyhome71: Trent Williams	1.0	0.775794610381126	0.2514174179756483

They mention "Back breaking drive" which implies a failed or poorly executed drive from their in-group team, though not explicitly stating "Steelers." The second sentence suggests a solution or criticism about something the team should have been doing all season, also implying it's about their in-group team. Therefore, both sentences should be tagged [IN], as the comment refers implicitly to the in-group, and '[SENT]' is the appropriate referring expression for both sentences.	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be lamenting the performance of their team despite the high win probability. The first sentence, "Back breaking drive," indicates a critical moment in the game, and by context, it refers to the in-group Steelers' drive. The second sentence suggests that the team should have been performing well all season, regardless of their starting quarterback (QB). As there are no explicit references to the team, each sentence "[SENT]" should be tagged with [IN] since the entire comment implicitly focuses on the in-group's actions and performance.	1671393147.0	steelers	panthers	695		3.0	0.898436400758811	0.6390125847047434

Since the Raiders are the in-group team that the commenter supports, the phrase "Raiders defense" should be tagged with [IN]. The comment is about the in-group team's defense, so "Raiders defense" clearly refers to the in-group. No other referring expressions are present in this comment that would need tagging.	EXPLANATION: The comment is sarcastically questioning the existence of pressure from the defense. Given that the commenter supports the Raiders, and the win probability is relatively low, it makes sense that they are frustrated with their own team's performance. With no immediate parent comment providing context, it can be inferred that 'Raiders defense' refers to the in-group. Consequently, 'Raiders defense' is tagged as [IN]. It implies that the commenter is disappointed with their own team (the Raiders), not applying sufficient defensive pressure to the opposing team (the Ravens).	1631579855.0	raiders	ravens	26		5.0	0.418117582798004	0.10003812428516966

Referees are neutral parties and are not associated with any specific team. Therefore, "the refs" should be tagged as [OTHER] since they are neither part of the in-group (Lions) nor the out-group (Packers), nor any other specific team but are a distinct group within the broader context of the NFL.	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses frustration with the referees, suggesting that they need to be held accountable by the people. This sentiment is a general statement about NFL referees as a whole, rather than being specific to the current game between the Lions (in-group) and Packers (out-group). Therefore, 'the refs' should be tagged as [OTHER], as it refers not to a specific team, but to a subgroup within the broader NFL context. The rest of the sentence should not be tagged, as it does not refer to any specific in-group, out-group, or other NFL entities.	1673222561.0	lions	packers	696	Tecmo Barry	5.0	0.704978406429291	0.0

[OUT] How the tables have turned 	['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (58, 64)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The first sentence is recognizing a good performance ('Nice completion') followed by a penalty that is viewed as lenient ('soft penalty'). This suggests the commenter is critiquing a penalty against the in-group's opponents, making this implicitly about the in-group. Since there is no explicit reference to the in-group team in this sentence, the entire sentence is tagged as [IN]. The second sentence also lacks any explicit reference and continues expressing satisfaction, so it is tagged as [IN]. The third sentence, "How the tables have turned," indicates a shift in the game situation favoring the commenter’s in-group team over the out-group, hence the phrase is tagged as [OUT] because it implicitly refers to a negative turn for the out-group team.	EXPLANATION: The Seahawks are the in-group for the commenter, while the Cardinals are the out-group. The win probability is relatively low for the Seahawks, suggesting they are not doing well in the game.   The first sentence likely refers to a positive play made by the in-group (Seahawks), indicated by 'Nice completion,' and 'a soft penalty,' which implies a favorable outcome despite the low win probability. Since there are no explicit words for the in-group in the first sentence, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged [IN].  The second sentence is just 'Nice,' which, given the context of the previous sentence, is also likely responding to the favorable completion and soft penalty. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN] as it complements the first sentence in expressing satisfaction with the in-group's play.  In the third sentence, 'How the tables have turned' implies a shift in momentum. Given the low win probability for the Seahawks, this shift is likely to have favored the out-group (Cardinals). Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged [OUT] as it pertains to a change that benefits the opposing team.  Thus, the tagged entities and their explanations are valid based on the context and win probability.	1637534260.0	seahawks	cardinals	699	:sea1:​	1.0	0.250516980886459	0.390079222182211

In this context, "Bucs" refers to the Buccaneers, which is the in-group team the commenter supports, so it should be tagged [IN]. The "Cowboys" are not the opponent team (Eagles) nor the in-group team (Buccaneers), and therefore should be tagged [OTHER]. Hence, the correct tagging is 'Cowboys' as [OTHER] and 'Bucs' as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing two teams: “Cowboys” and “Bucs.” The “Bucs” refers to the Buccaneers, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, “Bucs” should be tagged with [IN]. The “Cowboys” refers to the Dallas Cowboys, which are not involved in the current game between the Buccaneers and the Eagles. Hence, the “Cowboys” should be tagged with [OTHER]. The win probability is 100%, indicating a high confidence situation, which aligns with the pleasant and optimistic tone of the comment.	1642364933.0	buccaneers	eagles	700		1.0	0.99989902973175	0.7641181193683647

["O'Neil"]	[(7, 13)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is lamenting that O'Neil got beaten badly, which indicates a defensive mistake or failure. Since the commenter is a Vikings fan and O'Neil is a player for the Vikings, the mention of his mistake would primarily concern the in-group team. Therefore, "O'Neil" should be tagged [IN] as he is a member of the in-group, the Vikings. The second sentence expresses an exclamation and does not explicitly refer to any specific entity, thus it does not need tagging. "O'Neil" being tagged as [IN] aligns with the in-group perspective of the commenter.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is likely a supporter of the Vikings and is pointing out a poor performance by O'Neil, who is a player on the Vikings (the in-group). The comment does not specify which team the player belongs to, but context and common usage suggests that complaining about a specific player without elaboration is typical of fans discussing their own team. The win probability indicates that the Vikings are moderately likely to win, but immediate concerns about specific plays (like O'Neil getting beat) can still cause frustration. Thus, "[SENT]" should be tagged with "[IN]" and "O'Neil" should be tagged with "[IN]" since it refers to a member of the in-group team. The exclamation "Damn!" is an expression of frustration likely directed at the same event, so no specific entity reference is needed there.	1664721031.0	vikings	saints	701	CC = Legend	5.0	0.58910071849823	0.3145332227444475

Since the teams involved in the context are the Cowboys (in-group) and the Lions (out-group), and none of the named Packers players are part of these teams, they are considered part of another team in the NFL. Therefore, these entities are tagged as [OTHER] because they refer to members of neither the in-group nor the out-group teams.	EXPLANATION: The game is between the Cowboys and the Lions. The commenter refers to 'Adams', 'OL', and 'Rodgers'. Since these individuals/positions are associated with the Packers, and neither the Cowboys nor the Lions, they should be tagged as [OTHER]. The Packers are not involved in this particular game, hence references to their players or positions are considered 'other'. Thus, 'Adams', 'OL', and 'Rodgers' should all be tagged [OTHER]. The win probability being 100% for the in-group team (Cowboys) suggests they are far ahead, likely contributing to the comment focusing on another team (Packers).	1666554312.0	cowboys	lions	702	Micah Parsons	1.0	0.999878979338973	0.9820925553319919

Therefore, 'Ozlewski' is tagged as [IN]. The presence of three unblocked defenders from the Bills (the out-group team) is mentioned, so 'Bills' is tagged as [OUT]. The sentence also implicitly criticizes the in-group's defensive effort, but since there are no explicit words or phrases referring to this, the explicit tags remain as stated.	The comment is reflective of the in-group team (Patriots) being in a difficult situation, as evidenced by the win probability of 0.0%. The mention of "3 unblocked Bills" clearly refers to the out-group team (Bills) because they are the opponents in this context. 'Ozlewski' refers to Gunner Olszewski, a player for the Patriots, hence it should be tagged as in-group. Despite the frustration shown in the comment, which might suggest larger systemic issues, the entities here are clearly defined: "Bills" refers to the opponent (out-group) and "Ozlewski" refers to the in-group team. Therefore, "Bills" should be tagged with [OUT] and "Ozlewski" with [IN].	1642304459.0	patriots	bills	703		3.0	2.8052298147951404e-05	0.830003805175038

"O is doo doo": "O" refers to the offense of the Dolphins, which is being criticized. It should therefore be tagged as [IN]. 2. "The D needs to win is this game by scoring": "The D" refers to the defense of the Dolphins, which is being relied upon to win the game. It should be tagged as [IN]. 3. "They have already given us great field position and the O squandered it": "They" refers to the Dolphins' defense, which has provided good field position, while "the O" refers to the Dolphins' offense, which has failed to capitalize on it. Both should be tagged as [IN]. 4. "Uggh": This expression of frustration is unspecified but pertains to the overall performance of the in-group team.

It's common for fans to refer to their own team's larger unit groups (offense/defense) without qualification if they expect other fans to understand it implicitly.   In the first sentence, "O" refers to the offense of the in-group team (Dolphins), and it's criticized as being 'doo doo', so it should be tagged [IN].  In the second sentence, "The D" refers to the defense of the in-group team needing to win the game by scoring. This indicates a level of expectation and responsibility that fans would place on their own team’s unit, so "The D" should be tagged [IN].  In the third sentence, "They" refers to the defense of the in-group team (from context, the same 'D' mentioned in the second sentence) since they are praised for their performance in providing good field position. Therefore, "They" should be tagged [IN]. Also in the third sentence, "the O" refers again to the offense of the in-group team (Dolphins) which squandered the given field position, thus it should also be	1633283454.0	dolphins	colts	704		4.0	0.610735207796097	0.2697215237030828

['Jones', 'Pettis', 'Fields']	[(21, 26), (31, 37), (133, 139)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter is talking about players associated with the in-group, which is the Bears. 'Jones' and 'Pettis' are both players for the Bears, and thus should be tagged as [IN]. Similarly, 'Fields' is the quarterback for the Bears, so he should also be tagged as [IN]. The commenter is discussing the performance and potential of their team's players, indicating support and optimism for them, which is something fans typically do for their in-group team. Therefore, the tagged output appropriately reflects these references as pertaining to the in-group.	The commenter is discussing the performance of players who are part of the in-group team, the Bears. 'Jones' and 'Pettis' should be tagged [IN] because they are players on the Bears who should have caught the passes. The commenter is also hopeful about 'Fields,' who is the quarterback of the Bears. Therefore, 'Jones' and 'Pettis' should be tagged as [IN] in the first sentence. The second sentence describes the passes as amazing, which doesn't specify who made the passes but implies positivity towards the in-group. The third sentence explicitly mentions 'Fields' and reflects optimism, thus referring to the Bears' quarterback. 'Fields' should be tagged [IN]. The low win probability indicates that the Bears are not doing well in the game, aligning with the commenter's frustration and hopefulness for future improvements with 'actual WRs' (wide receivers). Therefore, the correct tags are [IN] for 'Jones', 'Pettis', and 'Fields'.	1667155197.0	bears	cowboys	705	Blowup	6.0	0.04955155029892899	0.5220535714285715
train	rvg9um	hr65izv	t3_rvg9um	[SENT] Damn , [IN] sucks . 	['Claypool']	[(14, 22)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 Claypool, in this context, refers to Chase Claypool, who is a player for the Steelers. Since the commenter is expressing a negative opinion about a player from the team they support (Steelers), it indicates frustration with their own team. Therefore, 'Claypool' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group player's performance.	EXPLANATION: Chase Claypool is a wide receiver for the Pittsburgh Steelers, who are the in-group team for the commenter. The expression of dissatisfaction ("sucks") in the context of a high win probability suggests that the commenter is criticizing a player's performance despite the team's good position in the game. Thus, "Claypool" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group player.	1641269350.0	steelers	browns	706	:heinz1::heinz2:	7.0	0.932271182537079	0.8624211225506476

In this context, the commenter is expressing confusion about the Dolphins (the in-group team) losing the game. Hence, 'we' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The use of the word "we" generally indicates the commenter is talking about their own team, which would be the Dolphins (in-group) in this case. Despite the in-group team's win probability being relatively high, the comment expresses frustration at the current state of the game. Since "we" refers to the Dolphins, the in-group team, it should be tagged as [IN].	1665335740.0	dolphins	jets	707		2.0	0.5666070580482481	0.06919464871090636

Although there is no explicit mention of the in-group team (Browns), the context suggests the commenter is reacting to something associated with the Browns. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] because the sentiment conveyed in the comment is implicitly connected to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is presumably expressing frustration or resignation about the current state of the game since the win probability for the Browns (in-group) is relatively low. This feeling suggests that the commenter's team is not doing well, prompting the decision to start drinking earlier than planned. There are no explicit mentions of either the in-group or out-group teams, but the emotional response indicates it’s about the in-group’s performance. Hence, the "[SENT]" token is tagged with [IN].	1665944161.0	browns	patriots	577	:Baghead:	4.0	0.305881172418594	0.3640949309517903

train	ybhrrs	ithtc85	t3_ybhrrs	[SENT] But [IN] should have been more aggressive going into half right ? 	['Dan']	[(11, 14)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is expressing an opinion on a coach's decision-making, which typically indicates they are talking about their own team's coach. Since the in-group team is the Lions and "Dan" refers to Dan Campbell, who is the head coach of the Lions, "Dan" should be tagged [IN]. No other explicit references are made to any other entities in the comment.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is likely critiquing the coaching decisions made by the in-group team, the Lions, since ‘Dan’ presumably refers to Dan Campbell, who is the head coach of the Lions. Given the low win probability, it makes sense for the commenter to be second-guessing tactical decisions made by the coach of the in-group team. Hence, 'Dan' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team's head coach.	1666552985.0	lions	cowboys	710	DETROIT -VS- EVERYBODY	2.0	0.12698894739151	0.8485915492957746

['Dallas']	[(19, 25)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment mentions 'Dallas' which refers to the Dallas Cowboys, the out-group team. The phrase "absolutely pushing our shit in" implies that the commenter is acknowledging a defeat or poor performance by their team, which is the Vikings. 'Dallas' is correctly tagged with [OUT] since it refers to the out-group opponent team in this context.	EXPLANATION: The comment mentions ‘Dallas’, which is a common referring expression for the out-group, the Cowboys. The Vikings are the in-group, as suggested by the parent comment mentioning Dallas 'pushing our shit in', indicating the commenter feels the in-group (Vikings) are performing poorly, reflected by the very low win probability. Hence, 'Dallas' should be tagged [OUT] because it refers to the opponent team, the Cowboys. There are no other specific entities mentioned explicitly in the sentence.	1668987069.0	vikings	cowboys	711		6.0	0.0005405144183896	0.6886818306385311
test	xzp3pw	irnntry	t3_xzp3pw	[SENT] 4TH !?!?! [SENT] [IN] OBVIOUSLY GOT IT ?? 	['HE']	[(24, 26)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is expressing disbelief that a player did not convert a 4th down, which implies that the person commenting is upset about a potential refereeing error against the team they support. 'HE' refers to a player who the commenter believes made the play, and since the commenter is a Buccaneers supporter, it is reasonable to assume that 'HE' refers to a Buccaneers player. Therefore, 'HE' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. The first sentence doesn't mention any specific group, so it remains untagged.	EXPLANATION: The second sentence is expressing surprise and a positive assertion that "HE OBVIOUSLY GOT IT". Given that 'HE' is in capital letters, it signifies emphasis, often used by fans of the in-group talking about a key player or a significant play. The high win probability (83.4%) for the in-group suggests they are doing well, and fans are more likely to support and emphasize their team’s achievements. Therefore, 'HE' is likely an in-group player on the Buccaneers, making the second sentence implicitly about the in-group. Thus 'HE' should be tagged with [IN]. The first sentence does not explicitly reference any group, so only the second sentence is tagged in the RESPONSE.	1665336144.0	buccaneers	falcons	712	:tn: Tennessee 	2.0	0.833861947059631	0.10553037171350861

The mention of "we" and "guys" in the quoted sentence further suggests that the announcer is talking about the in-group team, giving advice or criticism to the players. Thus, "Panthers" should be tagged with [IN] since it signifies the in-group team, and the overall sentiment of staying in bounds relates to the in-group team's performance.	The comment references an announcer from the Panthers, which is the in-group team that the commenter supports. The quote within the comment suggests frustration from the Panthers announcer, who is likely speaking about the in-group team's performance given their low win probability, indicating they are not doing well in the game. The expression "what are we doing guys" strongly implies that the commenter identifies with the in-group team, as they are frustrated with their performance. Thus the term 'Panthers' should be tagged as [IN] since it explicitly refers to the in-group team and their announcer.	1637528381.0	panthers	commanders	713		4.0	0.0938853621482849	0.9558399423215573

This kind of detailed critique is usually directed at one's own team rather than the opponent. Thus, "Scott" is tagged with [IN] since he is part of the Commanders’ coaching staff. The overall tone of frustration signifies the commenter is unhappy with decisions made by their own team.	EXPLANATION: Given the context of the comment, it appears to be a critique of the in-group team's play-calling, specifically targeting someone named 'Scott' for their decision-making. 'Scott' is likely a coach or coordinator for the Commanders, which indicates that he is part of the in-group team. The Commanders have a low win probability, supporting the idea that the commenter is frustrated with their own team's performance. Therefore, 'Scott' is tagged with [IN] since he is being blamed for a frustrating situation related to the in-group team.	1671923405.0	commanders	49ers	26		1.0	0.07410868257284198	0.6580105633802817

['Tucker', 'we']	[(36, 42), (73, 75)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment is by a Ravens fan and expresses a sense of trust that seeing Tucker (Justin Tucker, Ravens' kicker) on the sidelines implies a victory for the Ravens. Therefore, 'Tucker' is tagged [IN] as he is a player for the in-group Ravens. Additionally, 'we' is tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports, the Ravens. The phrase "I'll know we've won" clearly indicates the certainty of winning in favor of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: Tucker refers to Justin Tucker, who is a well-known kicker for the Ravens, the in-group team the commenter supports. The phrase "I 'll know we 've won" also implies that the commenter is speaking from the perspective of a Ravens supporter, as "we" here refers to the in-group team. The low win probability indicates they are currently losing, but the commenter is still hopeful and believes that seeing Tucker on the sidelines signifies a strong chance of winning, likely because of his ability to score critical field goals. Thus, 'Tucker' and 'we' should be tagged with [IN], as they both refer to entities associated with the in-group.	1636320113.0	ravens	vikings	714		1.0	0.389526441693306	0.9481964087080883

['they', 'Patricia']	[(11, 15), (75, 83)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The first sentence is criticizing the use of screen plays, which is likely a complaint directed at the in-group team, the Patriots, since fans are more likely to criticize their own team's strategy. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence mentions Patricia, who is Matt Patricia, a coach for the Patriots, thus 'Patricia' should also be tagged [IN] as he is part of the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing the strategy and play-calling of their in-group team, the Patriots. The first sentence questions the team's decision to use a lot of screen passes, and without further context, 'they' is assumed to refer to the in-group team. The second sentence refers to Patricia, who likely refers to Matt Patricia, a coach on the Patriots' staff. Thus, 'they' in the first sentence should be tagged [IN] and 'Patricia' in the second sentence should also be tagged [IN] as both refer to the in-group. The win probability indicates the Patriots are doing fairly well, but the comment indicates frustration with a specific aspect of their play.	1670898475.0	patriots	cardinals	26		3.0	0.61127245426178	0.374354116431278
train	1065lmy	j3fbcil	t3_1065lmy	[SENT] Is [IN] BUS 2.0 ? 	['Henry']	[(10, 15)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 In the context of the comment, the reference to "Henry" is highly likely to be about Derrick Henry, who is a star running back for the Tennessee Titans. Since the commenter supports the Titans, any reference to Derrick Henry would refer to a player from the in-group team. There are no other players named Henry on the Jaguars who would be relevant in this context. Thus, "Henry" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The commenter refers to "Henry," which most likely denotes Derrick Henry, a well-known player for the Titans, the in-group team. Given the high win probability, the fan is probably enthused and comparing Henry to another great back (BUS 2.0, potentially referring to "The Bus," Jerome Bettis). Therefore, "Henry" refers to the in-group and should be tagged [IN]. There are no other explicit words referencing the in-group, out-group, or other teams, so the sentence itself isn't tagged further.	1673149881.0	titans	jaguars	715		0.0	0.741643011569977	0.9010215882806476
train	qjtosl	hisaa4q	t3_qjtosl	[OUT] 14 - 0 incoming 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	[4]	 When the commenter says "14 - 0 incoming," it implies that a score change is about to happen. Given the context of sports commentary, this score is likely to be in favor of the out-group or opponent team since there's no explicit indication that it is a score for the in-group team. If the Titans (in-group) were increasing their lead, the commenter would likely express more positive emotion or explicitly reference the Titans. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged [OUT] to indicate that the score refers to the Colts increasing their lead.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the in-group (Titans) is low at 10.9%, suggesting that they are likely losing the game. When a commenter says "14 - 0 incoming," it typically indicates an imminent score or prediction of the out-group (Colts) increasing their lead. Since the comment implies that the opponent (Colts) will soon have a score of 14 while the in-group (Titans) remain at 0, '[SENT]' should be tagged with [OUT] as the implicit subject of the score prediction is the out-group team.	1635700933.0	titans	colts	716		1.0	0.10867106175843999	0.09294320137693632

['the hawks']	[(20, 29)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter expresses a resigned acceptance of their in-group team's poor performance (“hawks being bad”) but is upset with the officiating (“bullshit calls”). The term "hawks" is a colloquial reference to the "Seahawks," which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Thus, "the hawks" should be tagged with [IN]. The second part of the sentence, which mentions the "bullshit calls," does not explicitly reference any team but implies a sense of injustice felt by a supporter of the in-group, so no additional tags are required.	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be resigned to the fact that their team, the Seahawks (often referred to as the 'hawks'), isn't playing well in this game, which is reflected by their low win probability of 20%. The phrase "the hawks" without further qualification typically indicates a reference to the in-group team, especially since the parent comment confirms this context. Therefore, "the hawks" should be tagged [IN], as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. The rest of the comment about "bullshit calls" doesn't specify an in-group or out-group and therefore isn't tagged with a specific label.	1665342699.0	seahawks	saints	717		2.0	0.20033863186836198	0.6493038080858916

The expression 'Fuck Maddox had it man' shows frustration, likely about a missed opportunity or mistake by an in-group player. Therefore, 'Maddox' is tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group entity.	EXPLANATION: The high win probability of 87.8% indicates that the in-group, the Eagles, are doing well and probably in a commanding position. Maddox is a player on the Eagles, thus referring to an in-group member. The comment is expressing frustration that Maddox, an in-group player, did not capitalize on an opportunity. Therefore, "Maddox" should be tagged as [IN].	1667527950.0	eagles	texans	718		2.0	0.878230012953281	0.6895395839495219

The use of 'this' indicates that the commenter is talking about the in-group team's defense, as fans typically use possessive language when referring to their own team. Therefore, 'This d' should be tagged [IN] as it denotes the in-group team (Titans).	EXPLANATION: The win probability is slightly favoring the in-group (Titans), suggesting they are performing well. The phrase 'This d' likely refers to the defense, a common shorthand in NFL lingo. Since 'd' is mentioned without specifying any team and the win probability is relatively balanced but in favor of the Titans, the commenter is probably referring to the Titans' defense, highlighting their strong performance. Therefore, 'This d' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team (Titans).	1642887469.0	titans	bengals	719		2.0	0.511018991470337	0.027741330834114338

Therefore, 'defense' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team's defensive unit. 'Stafford' refers to Matthew Stafford, the quarterback of the Rams, which is the out-group team. Consequently, 'Stafford' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to a player on the out-group team. The commenter is encouraging the in-group defense to capitalize on potential mistakes by Stafford, which further confirms the tagging of 'defense' as [IN] and 'Stafford' as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment is reflective of the in-group team the commenter supports since it contains a cheer for the defense, which typically means it is for the team they are rooting for. 'defense' refers to the in-group team (Packers), so it is tagged as [IN]. The comment also mentions 'Stafford,' who is a quarterback for the Rams, the out-group team, and anticipates that he will throw potential interceptions. Thus, 'Stafford' is tagged as [OUT]. The win probability being relatively high for the in-group team indicates that the Packers are probably doing well, and the commenter is looking for the defense to capitalize on potential mistakes by the out-group's quarterback.	1638139231.0	packers	rams	720	:GB:	3.0	0.69140288233757	0.37968094038623007

The mention of his name in an apprehensive context suggests that the commenter's concern is about a player from their own team, which aligns with the idea that fans often express worry about the performance of their own players. Therefore, 'McKenzie' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team (Bills) player.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Bills and the out-group team is the Bears. McKenzie is a player on the Bills, which makes him part of the in-group. The reaction from the commenter's mom indicates anxiety or concern whenever McKenzie moves, suggesting she is familiar with him as a player on the team they support. Hence, 'McKenzie' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Bills).	1671914689.0	bills	bears	721	:block-B::block-I::block-L::block-L::block-S:	20.0	0.9811558723449707	0.8959580149157537

'niners' is therefore tagged [OUT] because it refers to another team that is playing against the Seahawks, who are the in-group. The term 'us' is tagged [IN] because it refers to the Seahawks, the team the commenter supports. The first part of the comment refers generally to the game without mentioning specific teams, so it does not receive a specific tag.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a Seahawks fan and is currently watching the Seahawks play the Panthers, with the Seahawks having a low win probability of 21.4%. The phrase "This is embarrassing to watch" implies that the commenter is not happy with the performance of their team (the Seahawks). The reference to "niners" (49ers) suggests that the commenter is looking ahead to the next game where they think the opponent (49ers) will have an easy time against their team. The use of "us" refers to the commenter's in-group team, the Seahawks. Thus, "niners" should be tagged with [OUT] as it refers to another team the commenter will face, and "us" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the commenter's own team, the Seahawks.	1670796316.0	seahawks	panthers	722		8.0	0.213777914643288	0.21913155237308363

Additionally, "we" refers to the commenter and other Lions fans who are accustomed to having a terrible running game. This indicates a sense of shared experience among the in-group supporters, hence 'we' should also be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter specifically identifies themselves as a fan of the Lions, noting "I think as Lions fans." This clearly indicates that they are referencing the in-group, so "Lions" should be tagged [IN]. The phrase "a lot of us" used in the same context also implies that they are talking about themselves and other Lions fans. The word "we" further refers to the collective group of Lions fans who have become accustomed to having a poor running game, so it should also be tagged [IN]. The overall sentiment reflects an understanding and resignation that is typical of how in-group fans might discuss long-standing issues with their own team.	1670784211.0	lions	vikings	724		2.0	0.490635335445404	0.2138657305835893

Since the in-group team is the Patriots, it makes sense that the commenter is talking about a player from their own team. Therefore, 'Meyers' is tagged [IN] because it refers to an in-group player who the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: While the win probability is low for the in-group, which might indicate they are not doing well overall, the comment focuses on a specific play involving a player. Meyers is a player for the Patriots, the in-group team the commenter supports. Since 'Meyers' refers to an in-group player and is blamed for not looking, it should be tagged with [IN].	1639884564.0	patriots	colts	725		6.0	0.12168760597705797	0.7550885789672069

The commenter is expressing excitement or amazement about Dak Prescott's performance, which aligns with the in-group team they support. Therefore, 'DAK' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. The sentence overall is implicitly about the in-group, which is why '[SENT]' is not additionally tagged; the explicit reference to 'DAK' captures the in-group context adequately.	EXPLANATION: The high win probability of 95.4% suggests that the in-group team, the Cowboys, is likely performing very well. The commenter appears to be praising Dak Prescott for his outstanding performance. Since Dak Prescott is the quarterback for the Cowboys, mentioning "DAK" is a clear reference to an in-group player. Consequently, the term "DAK" should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to a player from the in-group team, the Cowboys.	1673922639.0	cowboys	buccaneers	726		2.0	0.9540351770871293	0.3948154657293497

['[SENT]']	[(26, 32)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses a resigned attitude towards the ongoing performance, which suggests that the commenter is referring to a continuous pattern experienced by their own team. The mention of the "last 6 games" implies an in-group perspective where the commenter is noting their team's consistent failures or disappointments. Since the in-group team here is the Browns, the second sentence should be tagged as [IN]. The first sentence, while exasperated, doesn't reference any specific entity, so it doesn't need additional tagging in this context. Thus, '[SENT]' is the correct tagged output for the second sentence to represent the in-group implicitly, as it refers to the in-group’s performance.	The win probability is quite low for the in-group Browns, indicating they are likely losing or not doing well in the game. The parent comment discusses Chubb (a Browns player) being benched when Lamar (a Ravens player) takes the lead, showing frustration and pessimism about the Browns' performance. The second sentence in the comment suggests a sense of inevitability or frustration concerning the Browns' pattern of losing the last six games. Although the in-group team is not explicitly mentioned in the second sentence, it implicitly refers to the in-group Browns' recent poor performance. Thus, the second sentence reflects in-group sentiments, even though no explicit reference to the in-group is made.  Therefore, '[SENT]' for the second sentence should be tagged with '[IN]', as it indirectly refers to the Browns.	1666549500.0	browns	ravens	728		2.0	0.23039430379867498	0.4720686367969495
train	rk5mur	hp8a0fo	t3_rk5mur	[IN] Terrible challenge imo 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment 'Terrible challenge imo' does not provide any explicit reference to the in-group or out-group team. The default assumption is that a fan is commenting on their own team's performance or decisions, usually out of frustration or criticism regarding a challenge call. Hence, this comment is likely expressing dissatisfaction with a decision made by the in-group team (Packers). Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged [IN] as it implicitly refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The high win probability for the in-group (Packers) suggests that they are most likely in a favorable position during the game. The comment is expressing dissatisfaction with a challenge, and since there is no indication that the challenge pertains to the out-group or another team, it is reasonable to infer that it is about the in-group (Packers). Fans are more likely to criticize their team's decisions, especially when they feel secure in their position. Therefore, the implicit reference here is about the in-group, and '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	1639956798.0	packers	ravens	729		-6.0	0.8422196507453921	0.6888529596694511

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter is likely expressing a sense of amazement or envy at the productivity of another team's draft picks, implying their own team's draft picks might not be producing similarly. Since it is a comparison that implicitly praises an external team, and the in-group team is the Jets, it is reasonable to assume that this comment is referring to the out-group, the Steelers. Thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]' since the comment is implicitly referring to the out-group's successful draft picks, even though there is no explicit mention of specific players or the opponent team.	The comment is implicitly praising the performance of draft picks, and given the context of a positive in-group win probability, this is likely reflective of the out-group team (Steelers) whose draft picks are performing well. The comment seems to imply an unfamiliarity or sarcasm regarding the in-group draft picks' performance, suggesting the out-group's draft picks are notably doing well in this game. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OUT]' since the comment, while not explicitly mentioning the out-group, is indirectly referring to the out-group's effective draft picks contributing to their current play.	1664733963.0	jets	steelers	730	:OtherPain:	12.0	0.720573782920837	0.3328100470957614

As the commenter supports the Packers, any references to Packers players, past or present, will be considered in-group. Therefore, "Adams" is tagged as [IN]. The comment reflects on the sentiment towards Adams when he was younger and part of the Packers, thus justifying the in-group tag.	EXPLANATION: The comment is reflective of the history and discussions among fans in the sub, with the context provided by the parent comment being about players deserving apologies. 'Adams' here refers to Davante Adams, a player who played for the Packers, which is the in-group team. Given that the commenter is talking about hatred towards Adams by people (presumably fans) on the sub when he was young, it shows support for the in-group player and hence 'Adams' should be tagged with [IN].	1668385348.0	packers	cowboys	732		1.0	0.38827258348465	0.8451256603169521

In this context, the commenter is discussing an action or decision by the Titans, which makes them a relevant entity, but under the 'other' category since they are a different team in the NFL. Thus, 'the Titans' should be tagged with [OTHER] as it accurately reflects their status as a team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group in this context.	EXPLANATION: The comment is referring to the Titans, who are neither the in-group (Eagles) nor the out-group (Vikings) in this context. The Titans are another team in the NFL. The phrase 'what the actual fuck were the Titans thinking' suggests that the commenter is questioning a decision made by the Titans, without connecting the sentiment to the in-group or out-group teams. Therefore, 'the Titans' is tagged as [OTHER].	1663640519.0	eagles	vikings	733		5.0	0.965770125389099	0.6586165772212283

Fans typically use "we" when talking about their own team, expressing hope for a positive outcome. In this case, 'we' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the Dolphins, the in-group team in this context.	EXPLANATION: The word 'we' typically indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group team that they support, and in this case, the commenter supports the Dolphins. Given that the win probability is quite low (10.0%), the comment likely reflects the commenter's hope for a turnaround or positive result for their team. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the Dolphins, the in-group team.	1663530737.0	dolphins	ravens	734		5.0	0.09976071119308505	0.8498538622129437

['him', 'him']	[(55, 58), (122, 125)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is likely referring to a quarterback or key player on the in-group team (the Bears) who has not been playing well. The context indicates that the commenter is discussing someone whose performance has been underwhelming from the beginning, which is a critique they would typically direct at their own team's player. The first instance of 'him' refers to this player, and thus should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, the commenter talks about having to let 'him' throw the ball eventually, which further implies a discussion about their own quarterback, reiterating that 'him' again refers to an in-group player. Thus, both instances of 'him' should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The parent comment indicates a discussion about not throwing, which typically involves a key player like the quarterback. Given the in-group is the Bears and the win probability is somewhat favorable, the commenter is likely referring to a player on their own team who is not performing well when throwing. The first 'him' refers to the player not playing well, and in the context provided by the parent comment, it likely refers to a Bears player. The second 'him' refers to the same player, noting the necessity of letting him throw despite his performance issues. Thus, 'him' in both sentences is tagged with [IN] since they refer to an in-group player's underperformance.	1664133988.0	bears	texans	735		1.0	0.564256072044373	0.8182938388625592

Since the mention of "a Bears quarterback" is about a player from the in-group team, it should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, "Bears" is tagged [IN] as it explicitly refers to the in-group team, the Bears. The context of the comment implies familiarity and a certain expectation tied to the in-group team's player, which further validates the tagging of "Bears" as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is talking about an interception that a Bears quarterback is likely to throw. 'Bears' in this context is referring to the in-group team, as the commenter is a supporter of the Bears. Since the commenter is making a remark about the predictability of the Bears' quarterback throwing an interception, it is implied that 'Bears' should be tagged with [IN] (in-group). The extremely low win probability supports the negative tone towards the in-group team's performance. Thus, 'Bears' is correctly tagged as [IN] because it denotes the in-group team here.	1668977795.0	bears	falcons	736	Bears	0.0	0.029777228832244984	0.9852899575671853

Since the comment mentions "Cowboys have an excuse," it is clear that "Cowboys" refers to the out-group, which are the opponent team. The word "ours" refers to the team supported by the commenter, indicating the in-group, which are the Vikings here. The first sentence is a general statement about the game and does not contain explicit references to the in-group or out-group. Therefore, "Cowboys" should be tagged [OUT] and "ours" should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the out-group (Cowboys) and in-group (Vikings), respectively.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is not happy with the quality of the game, describing it as "such an ugly game," and is contrasting the performance of both teams. In the second sentence, they mention that the "Cowboys have an excuse," which is logically referring to the out-group, hence "Cowboys" is tagged [OUT]. The phrase "not sure what ours is" is referring to the in-group team, the Vikings, and expressing uncertainty about the in-group's performance or excuse. Hence, "ours" is tagged [IN] in the context of the Vikings having a 0.0% win probability.	1635733309.0	vikings	cowboys	737		3.0	0.0	1.0
test	z66a82	iy0hinr	t3_z66a82	[SENT] [IN] MY BOY !!!!

Since Allgeier is a player for the Falcons, the in-group team the commenter supports, "ALLGEIER" should be tagged with [IN] to indicate that it refers to the in-group. The enthusiasm in the comment implies a positive sentiment toward an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The comment enthusiastically refers to "ALLGEIER," who is Tyler Allgeier, a player for the Atlanta Falcons, the in-group team. The expression "MY BOY" indicates that the commenter is very excited and likely cheering for this player, which aligns with being a supporter of the Falcons. Therefore, "ALLGEIER" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a player on the in-group team. The win probability being 37% suggests the Falcons are trailing, so the comment’s tone likely reflects the joy or hope brought by a positive play from Allgeier despite the overall game situation.	1669581561.0	falcons	commanders	738		3.0	0.36971738934516896	0.9439486613857415

['our', 'them']	[(13, 16), (39, 43)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing frustration that their own team, the Packers, never has both their offense and defense performing well at the same time. The word "our" is a clear indication of the in-group (Packers), showing ownership and affiliation. The word "them" refers to the different parts of the team (likely offense and defense), and since "our" indicates the in-group, "them" should also be tagged as [IN] since it refers to components of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'our destiny' clearly indicates the in-group (Packers), as fans often refer to their own team with possessive pronouns like 'our'. The win probability being 100% suggests that the in-group is about to win or has already secured the victory, but the comment reflects a commonly shared frustration among fans about the team not performing optimally in all aspects. The phrase 'them both' refers to two parts of the in-group team (defense and offense), derived from the parent comment mentioning 'offense' and 'crap d'. Therefore, 'our' and 'them' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the in-group team, the Packers.	1637529750.0	packers	vikings	739	:4:	6.0	1.0	1.0

Since the commenter supports the Colts (the in-group) and the Jets are the opponent (the out-group), Josh Johnson should be tagged with [OUT]. The phrase "our shit" refers to the commenter’s team, the Colts, further indicating that "Josh Johnson" is an opponent. Thus, "Josh Johnson" should be tagged as [OUT], reinforcing the threat he poses to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely referring to the out-group as evidenced by the mention of Josh Johnson. Josh Johnson is known to be a player for the Jets, which is the out-group for the commenter who supports the Colts. The phrase "wrecks our shit" indicates a negative impact on the commenter’s team, which further confirms that Josh Johnson refers to the opponent. Consequently, 'Josh Johnson' should be tagged as [OUT]. The use of "our" implies the Colts, the team the commenter supports, but since there is no explicit reference, it doesn't get tagged in this case.	1636073771.0	colts	jets	740	Ashton Dulin	5.0	0.823165655136108	0.17640909486889103

Therefore, "Philly" should be tagged as [OUT]. The word "our" refers to the in-group team, the 49ers, indicating possession or association with the commenter's team, which means it should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence "[SENT] Good start" doesn't explicitly mention either the in-group or out-group, but it's likely referring to the in-group's performance in the context of the previous sentence. Thus, the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS are correct as annotated.	The comment discusses "Philly" exploiting "our run defense," which points to the opposition working against the in-group's defense.  1. "Philly" is a shorthand for Philadelphia and refers to the Eagles, the out-group team. Therefore, it is tagged as [OUT]. 2. "our" is typically used by fans to refer to their own team, making it refer to the in-group. Thus, it is tagged as [IN]. 3. The "[SENT]" token for the second sentence is neutral and does not directly refer to either team, so it remains untagged.  The win probability is fairly balanced, implying a competitive game. The commenter is acknowledging the in-group (49ers) and discussing a strategy of the out-group (Eagles).  Thus, "Philly" should be tagged [OUT], and "our" should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence "Good start" does not mention any entities explicitly, so no tag is needed for that sentence.  Hence, the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS are correctly tagged as follows.	1632071506.0	49ers	eagles	741	:jerseyaway08: Steve Young	9.0	0.576807856559753	0.053974394399926316

In the second sentence, "He did get hit as he was throwing tho," the referring expressions "He" and "he" are discussing a specific player who made a throwing decision. Given the context, this is likely a reference to the Rams' quarterback, an out-group player, especially since the parent comment criticizes a professional decision, which is common when discussing an opponent's poor play. Therefore, both instances of "He" and "he" are tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment is about a specific player's decision not being good and mentioning that the player got hit while throwing. The use of "Not a good decision" seems to refer back to the action made by someone, but without a clear indication of whether it's an in-group or out-group player, making it appropriate to tag the sentence as [OTHER] since it's ambiguous. In the second sentence, "He" and "he" both refer to a specific player who is throwing, likely indicating the quarterback from the out-group team (Rams) in this context. Given the context and win probability, the commenter is probably discussing a Rams player's performance. Thus, "He" and "he" should be tagged as [OUT].	1670553106.0	raiders	rams	499		0.0	0.894481711089611	0.41650706794345643

The phrase 'the jets' explicitly references the in-group team, so it should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing frustration about the referees and implying that they are unfairly penalizing the in-group team, the Jets. 'Refs' are typically neutral parties and therefore should be tagged as [OTHER], since they are not inherently linked to any specific team. 'the jets' clearly refers to the in-group team and therefore should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability is relatively low, indicating the Jets might be struggling, which aligns with the comment’s tone of frustration toward the officiating. Thus, "[OTHER]" for 'Refs' and "[IN]" for 'the jets' are appropriate tags.	1639335793.0	jets	saints	742		6.0	0.277524262666702	0.33293335794720325

'They' refers to the in-group (Cowboys) because the commenter and the parent comment are both discussing the Cowboys' performance and their inability to sustain momentum. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The parent comment indicates disappointment with the Cowboys' current performance and their apparent acceptance of a lower playoff seed, which sets the context for the follow-up comment. The commenter agrees with this sentiment in the first sentence, labeling it as disappointing (implicitly referring to the in-group, the Cowboys). In the second sentence, the commenter wishes that the Cowboys would have carried over their emotion from the previous week, which is a hopeful sentiment directed towards their team. The word "they" in this sentence refers to the Cowboys, the in-group team. Given that the win probability is relatively low, the in-group team (Cowboys) is likely underperforming, making this disappointment and hope for better performance contextually relevant. Thus, "they" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team.	1641162299.0	cowboys	cardinals	743		1.0	0.366233770858981	0.31958023141088887

Given that the in-group is the Chiefs and Creed Humphrey is a well-known center for the Chiefs, 'Creed' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: 'Creed' here refers to Creed Humphrey, a player for the Chiefs, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Given the high win probability for the in-group, it makes sense that the commenter is expressing love and admiration for an in-group player. The second sentence is just a laugh and does not provide any new information about the entities involved, so it doesn't need tagging. Thus, 'Creed' is correctly tagged with [IN] because Creed Humphrey plays for the Chiefs, the in-group team.	1636943150.0	chiefs	raiders	26		12.0	0.804404854774475	0.3530671134692358

Thus, 'McVay' should be tagged [OUT]. The 'refs from the SuperBowl' are referenced in a way suggesting that McVay might be trying to gain an unfair advantage, which aligns with the mindset of a fan criticizing the opponent team. Therefore, 'refs' should also be tagged [OUT] since it is in the context of helping the out-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is directed towards Sean McVay, who is the head coach of the Rams, the out-group team, casting him in a negative light by implying he needs help from referees to gain an unfair advantage. The 'refs' mentioned are also aligned with McVay, suggesting favoritism and linking it to a previous significant game (the SuperBowl). Since McVay is associated with the out-group team, 'McVay' should be tagged [OUT], and since 'refs' are being called upon in a manner that supports McVay and thus the out-group, they should also be tagged [OUT].	1668380429.0	cardinals	rams	744		3.0	0.885452404618263	0.5226280085493913

Mac Jones is a quarterback for the Patriots, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Mac' should be tagged as [IN]. The phrase 'opposing hoes' refers to the opposition team players, which in this context is the Texans, making it a reference to the out-group. Hence, 'opposing hoes' should be tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment discusses positive aspects of the season, and specifically mentions the player "Mac" who is Mac Jones, a quarterback for the Patriots, the in-group team. Therefore, "Mac" should be tagged as [IN]. The phrase "opposing hoes" derogatorily refers to the opponents, which in this context are the Texans, and hence should be tagged as [OUT]. Given the context and the win probability, the commenter is focusing on a specific player’s (Mac’s) performance against the opponents across multiple games, making these tags appropriate.	1633892939.0	patriots	texans	745		1.0	0.42819705605506897	0.7115040918069796

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is frustrated about a low average of less than one touchdown per game, which suggests they are critiquing their own team as fans typically express disappointment about their own team's performance. Therefore, the comment implicitly refers to the in-group, the Broncos, rather than the out-group or any other team. There is no explicit reference to the in-group team in the sentence, so the entire sentence is tagged as [IN] with '[SENT]' as the referring expression.	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing frustration over the team's performance, specifically stating that they are averaging less than 1 touchdown per game. Given the context, the in-group (Broncos) is more likely to be the subject of this frustration, especially since no other team is mentioned explicitly. The win probability at 27.4% indicates that the in-group is not performing well, aligning with the negative sentiment. Since there's no explicit mention of the team, the first "[SENT]" should be tagged with "[IN]" as it is implicitly referring to the in-group team, the Broncos. The second "[SENT]" expresses frustration, which also aligns with the disappointment towards the in-group team's performance.	1666062362.0	broncos	chargers	746	:CWxQy4O:	5.0	0.274134516716003	0.8571908602150538

['mac']	[(17, 20)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The name 'mac' likely refers to Mac Jones, who is the quarterback for the New England Patriots, the in-group team supported by the commenter. The commenter is asking about the haters of Mac Jones, implying they support Mac and, by extension, the Patriots. Therefore, 'mac' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment is asking where the haters of "Mac" are, likely referring to Mac Jones, who is a player for the Patriots. Given the in-group is the Patriots, "Mac" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group's player. Despite the relatively low win probability indicating the Patriots may not be performing well, the comment seems to be defending or challenging criticism against Mac Jones, further reinforcing that "Mac" is an in-group reference. Thus, "mac" is correctly tagged as [IN].	1633310540.0	patriots	buccaneers	26		6.0	0.394299321204532	0.3048987923116176

Frank Reich is the head coach of the Colts, and mentioning his play-calling directly refers to the in-group's performance. Therefore, "we" and "reich" should be tagged as [IN] because they pertain to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The use of "we" in the comment usually implies that the commenter is referring to the in-group team they support, which is the Colts in this case. Additionally, "Reich" refers to Frank Reich, who is the head coach of the Colts. The comment complaining about the play calling further indicates the focus is on the in-group. Even with a balanced win probability, the comment is about potential blame for losing, making it clear that both "we" and "reich" refer to the in-group. Thus, "[IN]" is the correct tag for these referring expressions.	1667171409.0	colts	commanders	747	Future HOF Bobby Okereke	1.0	0.500636130571365	0.9722331626624655

Therefore, 'Vikings' should be tagged as [OTHER] since this game involves a team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group.	The comment is referring to a game between the Vikings and not either of the teams involved in the current game (Lions vs. Bears). As such, ‘Vikings’ should be tagged as [OTHER] since it refers to another team in the NFL that is not part of the in-group (Lions) or out-group (Bears) for the commenter. Additionally, the win probability for the in-group (Lions) is 0.0%, indicating that they have no chance of winning the game, possibly leading the commenter to focus on other NFL games entirely. Therefore, 'Vikings' is tagged [OTHER].	1668374554.0	lions	bears	748	DETROIT -VS- EVERYBODY	11.0	0.0	1.0

Therefore, "Joe Barry" should be tagged [IN]. Additionally, "Packers FO" refers to the Packers' front office (FO), which is part of the in-group organization. Thus, "Packers FO" should also be tagged [IN], as it refers to the internal management team. The sentences reflect the commenter's discontent towards the in-group entities without mentioning the out-group (Saints).	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses frustration towards the in-group team's coaching staff. 'Joe Barry' is currently the defensive coordinator for the Packers, indicating an in-group entity. 'Packers FO' (Front Office) also refers to the internal staff within the in-group team. Both entities are part of the Packers organization, aligning with the in-group, hence they are tagged [IN]. The low win probability further suggests dissatisfaction with the team's performance, contributing to the overall tone of frustration directed at the in-group's management decisions. This is clearly a comment from a Packers fan criticizing their own team's organizational choices.	1631481862.0	packers	saints	26		6.0	0.18349471212692203	0.3462105573577116

He is a former coach known for his time with the San Francisco 49ers and Washington Football Team, making him an entity under the 'other' category. Since the comment refers to a person not affiliated with the in-group or out-group, 'Jim Tomsula' should be tagged as [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: Jim Tomsula is not associated with either the Cardinals (in-group) or the Rams (out-group). He is a former head coach of the San Francisco 49ers and has since held various coaching positions in the NFL not directly related to the teams playing in this particular game. Since he does not belong to the in-group or out-group, he should be tagged as [OTHER]. The comment is about him generally and not about the game itself, which accounts for the low win probability likely making the commenter look to other football-related topics. Therefore, 'Jim Tomsula' should be tagged [OTHER].	1642476247.0	cardinals	rams	751	:wolf: Wolf	1.0	0.0006642206571999543	0.6765578635014837

'Colts' explicitly refers to the out-group team and should be tagged with [OUT]. Similarly, 'they' is an anaphoric reference to the 'Colts' and should also be tagged with [OUT]. The comment does not mention or refer to the in-group (Titans) explicitly or implicitly. Therefore, both 'Colts' and 'they' should be correctly tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is talking about the Colts, who are the out-group for a Tennessee Titans fan, predicting that they will score a touchdown and a two-point conversion. The word 'Colts' directly refers to the out-group team and should be tagged [OUT]. The pronoun 'they' also refers back to the Colts and thus should likewise be tagged [OUT]. Given the high win probability, the commenter seems to be worrying about the opponent potentially scoring, which aligns with the overall context of the comment concerning the out-group. Therefore, tagging 'Colts' and 'they' with [OUT] is appropriate.	1664739375.0	titans	colts	752	:JRob:	5.0	0.810832142829895	0.9162688941925219

Hence, this should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence, "Fucking idiots," follows immediately from the first sentence criticizing a decision not to use Sanders more, implying frustration with the in-group team (Eagles) decision-making. Therefore, the [SENT] token for the second sentence should also be tagged with [IN], indicating overall frustration with the in-group team's management or decisions.	EXPLANATION: This comment is likely from a frustrated in-group fan because the win probability is relatively low for the Eagles. 'Sanders' refers to Miles Sanders, the running back for the Eagles, and the commenter seems annoyed that the Eagles didn't use him more effectively. For the second sentence, the expletive 'Fucking idiots' is strongly suggestive of frustration directed towards their own team's coaching or play-calling. As there is no explicit word to refer to the in-group in the second sentence, we tag the sentence itself with [IN]. Therefore, 'Sanders' and the entire second sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN].	1671924779.0	eagles	cowboys	336	Santa isn't real 	13.0	0.455376038451591	0.6978929125239441

Since the comment is about a perceived deficiency in the defensive pressure, it is reasonable to infer that they are referring to their own team, the Seahawks. There is no explicit mention of the in-group, but the context clearly indicates dissatisfaction with in-group performance. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to indicate that the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group (Seahawks).	EXPLANATION: The comment is a frustrated expression asking where the defensive pressure is, which is something that a fan would typically say about their own in-group team. The in-group team is the Seahawks, and the low win probability suggests they are struggling in the game, prompting this comment. With no explicit word or phrase in the comment referring directly to the Seahawks, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group. Hence, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' since it reflects the commenter's frustration with their own team (the Seahawks).	1669595241.0	seahawks	raiders	755	:sea1:​	6.0	0.334767246735282	0.9625357938275533

['[SENT]', 'the D']	[(23, 29), (60, 65)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 In the first sentence, there is no explicit mention of any team or player, so it remains untagged. In the second sentence, “Lucky break” suggests an event favoring the opposing team. Since the out-group is the Packers, it should be tagged [OUT] even though not explicitly mentioned. In the third sentence, "the D" refers to the defense of the in-group team, the Buccaneers, and expresses a positive sentiment about their performance, so it should be tagged [IN]. This results in '[SENT]' in the second sentence being tagged [OUT] due to the implicit reference to the out-group team benefiting from a lucky break and "the D" being tagged [IN].	The comment "Damn it, man!" is a general exclamation of frustration and doesn't contain any explicit references to either team, so it remains untagged. For the second sentence, "Lucky break," without further context typically indicates a positive turn of events for the opposing team, especially given the low win probability for the in-group (Buccaneers). Hence, it is tagged [OUT]. The third sentence, "At least the D looks to be heating up," is speaking positively about the defense, and in the absence of a qualifier, this likely refers to the in-group (Buccaneers). Therefore, 'the D' should be tagged [IN]. Thus, the labeling makes sense given the context and the roles of the teams.  - [OUT] for "Lucky break," indicating that the break was beneficial for the out-group (Packers). - [IN] for "the D," indicating that the defense belongs to the in-group (Buccaneers).	1664139559.0	buccaneers	packers	756	:o20: Ronde Barber	2.0	0.29914253950119	0.1890040725657164

Since they are expressing an unpopular opinion about their own team's offense and defense, both 'O' and 'D' must refer to the performance of in-group entities. Thus, 'O' and 'D' are tagged with [IN].	The commenter is making an observation about the respective performance of the offensive and defensive units within the in-group team (Eagles). 'O' referring to 'offense' and 'D' referring to 'defense' are shorthand notations commonly used by fans discussing their own team. Given that the win probability is relatively low, it indicates the Eagles are not doing well overall, which fits with the comment about the offense (O) having a worse game than the defense (D). Both 'O' and 'D' are therefore tagged as [IN] since they refer to entities within the in-group team, the Eagles.	1641151299.0	eagles	commanders	758		-1.0	0.34014704823494	0.4771859296482412

The commenter sarcastically mentions a potential Super Bowl matchup featuring the Buccaneers ('Bucs') and the Chiefs, both of which are neither the in-group nor the out-group teams, so 'Bucs' and 'Chiefs' should be tagged as [OTHER]. Additionally, Tom Brady is a player in the Buccaneers, and since the Buccaneers are neither the in-group nor the out-group, 'Tom Brady' is also tagged as [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is upset and believes that the NFL has a bias against their in-group team, the Cowboys. This is clear from the phrase "the Cowboys to win", making 'the Cowboys' tagged as [IN]. The mention of the Bucs and Chiefs refers to other NFL teams that are not the Cardinals, the out-group team, thus 'Bucs' and 'Chiefs' should be tagged as [OTHER]. 'Tom Brady' is a player for the Bucs, so it also gets tagged as [OTHER]. The win probability being in favor of the out-group team (Cardinals) aligns with the commenter's frustration towards the larger NFL organization and other teams that they feel are favored.	1641163095.0	cowboys	cardinals	759		1.0	0.37445205450058	0.3909767692169701
train	s05wnp	hs0jtyy	t3_s05wnp	[SENT] I never want to see [IN] again 	['Harris']	[(27, 33)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is expressing frustration with a player named Harris, likely due to poor performance which typically suggests he is a member of the in-group team. Since the commenter supports the Chargers, Harris is likely a Chargers player. Therefore, 'Harris' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group entity that the commenter is criticizing.	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses frustration directed at a player named Harris. Given that Harris is not specifically identified as belonging to the opposing team (Raiders) and the sentiment is negative, it's more likely referring to a player from the in-group (Chargers). This interpretation fits with the low win probability of the in-group (14.2%), which suggests the Chargers are not performing well, leading the commenter to not want to see a particular underperforming player again. Therefore, 'Harris' is tagged [IN] because he is likely an in-group player being criticized.	1641786732.0	chargers	raiders	26		5.0	0.14212579017132498	0.641851106639839

The use of "them" is a reference to the out-group, as it refers to the Steelers who the commenter wants to keep out of the end zone. Thus, "them" is correctly tagged as [OUT].	The comment is centered around preventing the opposing team from scoring a touchdown. The phrase "keep them out of the end zone" indicates the desire to stop the out-group, which in this case is the Steelers, from scoring. Since 'them' refers to the Steelers, who are the opponent, it is correctly tagged as [OUT]. The win probability is 100%, suggesting that the Chiefs (the in-group) are virtually assured of winning, but the commenter still wants the team to maintain a strong defensive stance by not allowing the Steelers to score, reinforcing the competitive mindset and hence, tagging 'them' as [OUT] is appropriate.	1642392197.0	chiefs	steelers	760		4.0	0.999653220176697	0.9316033364226135

['they', 'The Bears', 'Houston']	[(99, 103), (138, 147), (184, 191)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5, 5]	The explanation helps clarify why specific words and phrases are tagged as in-group, out-group, or other in the given comment in the context of NFL games: 1. Sentence 1: "What are you even talking about?" does not contain any explicit references to entities, so no tags are needed here.     2. Sentence 2: "14 is a VERY GOOD allowance." Similarly, this does not refer to specific entities directly related to the teams in question, so no tags are needed. 3. Sentence 3: "Settle down, they had a good showing today."    - "they" refers to the in-group team (Packers). The commenter is defending their team and emphasizing their good performance. Therefore, "they" should be tagged as [IN]. 4. Sentence 4: "The Bears are 3 - 2, not like we ’re playing Houston or something."    - "The Bears" refers to the out-group team (Bears), so it is tagged as [OUT].    - “we” refers to the in-group team (Packers), but there's no need to tag the [SENT] token since it's implicitly clear from the context.    - "Houston" refers to another NFL team (Texans) that's	EXPLANATION: In the larger context of discussing game performance, the commenter is refuting a negative perspective on the Bears' scoring. 'they' in the third sentence refers to the in-group (Packers), as the commenter points out a good showing by the team they support. 'The Bears' in the fourth sentence refers to the opponent and should be tagged as [OUT]. Meanwhile, 'Houston' refers to an unrelated team in the NFL and should be tagged as [OTHER]. The high win probability (99.6%) enhances the context that the in-group performed well and the commenter is defending their performance against criticism. Thus, referring expressions and their respective tags are correctly assigned as 'they' [IN], 'The Bears' [OUT], and 'Houston' [OTHER].	1634500648.0	packers	bears	762		0.0	0.9958891272544861	0.9699658072266888

['him', '[SENT]', 'Byron']	[(33, 36), (107, 113), (147, 152)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[4, 5, 4]	 The commenter is expressing frustration with a coach or player from their own team, the Buccaneers.  - 'him' in the first sentence refers to someone within the in-group, likely Byron Leftwich, the Buccaneers' offensive coordinator, given the context of calling plays. - The second sentence is a general expression of frustration, likely still about the in-group because it follows the continuous criticism. It is tagged as [IN] despite having no explicit mention of the team. - 'Byron' in the third sentence refers to Byron Leftwich, who is a member of the in-group team. Thus, 'him', 'Byron', and the second '[SENT]' expressing frustration are tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is criticizing the play-calling, which likely refers to the offensive coordinator of the in-group team (Buccaneers), especially since 'Byron' is mentioned and Byron Leftwich is the offensive coordinator for the Buccaneers. The win probability being close to 50% suggests it is a competitive game, so frustrations with the in-group's play-calling are likely in light of any missed opportunities. 'him' implicitly refers to Byron Leftwich, who is part of the Buccaneers coaching staff, thus it should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence 'What the fuck' is expressing frustration at the in-group's strategy or decisions, thus the [SENT] should be tagged [IN]. 'Byron' is explicitly mentioned and thus should be tagged [IN] as he is part of the in-group team (Buccaneers).	1667774333.0	buccaneers	rams	763	:alstottjersey: Alstott Jersey	10.0	0.462972939014435	0.4013493800145879

The commenter is likely referring to a key player or figure within the Bears (in-group) whom they believe is crucial to the team's success. Since there is no explicit word or phrase mentioning an entity, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' to indicate that the whole sentence implicitly refers to the in-group (Bears).	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely sarcastic given the context of a low win probability (29.7%). Fans often use hyperbolic or sarcastic praise to vent their frustrations when their team is not performing well. There are no explicit mentions of players or teams, but given that it is fairly common for fans to refer to their own team as "your" when addressing other fans to emphasize collective disappointment, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is referring derisively to the in-group, the Bears. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team.	1635708816.0	bears	49ers	764	1	1.0	0.2968430519104	0.831727681438664

['New York', 'New Jersey']	[(27, 35), (40, 50)]	['[OUT]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is asserting dominance over their geographic rivals. In this context, "We" refers to the in-group team, the Bills. "New York" and "New Jersey" refer to the regions associated with their out-group opponents, the Jets (who represent New York in their name despite playing in New Jersey). Thus, these geographic terms should be tagged [OUT] since they are associated with the opponent team in this context.	EXPLANATION: The phrase "We are the kings of New York and New Jersey" implies a dominance over other teams within those regions. The in-group team is the Bills, and the out-group opponent is the Jets, who are based in New York. Considering that there are no NFL teams based in New Jersey but the Giants and Jets both play there, it further suggests out-group references. Given the high win probability, the commenter is likely boasting about the in-group's superiority over these out-group entities. Hence, 'New York' and 'New Jersey' are tagged as [OUT] since they refer to regions associated with the out-group.	1636920076.0	bills	jets	765	:hamlin:	2.0	0.9940687417984009	0.5958858102434929

Since the in-group team is the Eagles, and the comment is positively highlighting a player from that team, 'Slay' should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is an Eagles fan, as indicated by the in-group being the Eagles. The player Slay is a well-known cornerback (CB) for the Eagles. The phrase "lockdown CB" is a term of praise, and the use of emojis suggests strong feelings, likely frustration that despite Slay's good performance, the win probability for the Eagles is very low. Therefore, 'Slay' should be tagged with [IN] since Slay is a player on the in-group team the commenter supports.	1632797374.0	eagles	cowboys	766		2.0	0.008891448112785971	0.8085443037974683

['We', 'We', 'we']	[(7, 9), (55, 57), (89, 91)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The repeated use of "We" and "we" in the comment strongly suggests that the commenter is referring to their in-group team, which is the Raiders. A commenter typically uses "we" to denote their support and association with their own team. Therefore: - The first instance of "We" in "We’re putting everything on the field" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the Raiders. - The second instance of "We" in "We’re gonna win but exactly what we wanted" should also be tagged as [IN] for the same reason. - The third instance of "we" in "exactly what we wanted" continues to refer to the Raiders, thus should be tagged as [IN]. All these expressions denote affiliation and support towards the in-group team Raiders.	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'We' in both sentences refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, which is the Raiders. This is indicated by the high win probability of 92.4%, suggesting that the in-group is performing well and is likely to win the game. The use of 'we' typically denotes a sense of collective identity and support for the in-group team. Therefore, 'We' in both sentences and 'we' later in the second sentence are tagged as [IN] since they all refer to the Raiders.	1641789108.0	raiders	chargers	767	:Logo_95-Present:	2.0	0.923849061131477	0.8125898246622593

['Refs']	[(7, 11)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The term "Refs" is typically neutral, but when fans feel that referees are impacting the game significantly, they might refer to them as an external entity impacting both teams. The comment seems to indicate that the referees are affecting the fairness of the game rather than favoring a particular team. Thus, "Refs" are tagged as [OTHER] because they are considered a neutral party not inherently biased toward either the in-group (49ers) or the out-group (Rams). No other explicit in-group or out-group references are present in this comment.	EXPLANATION: In American football, referees (or "Refs") are considered neutral parties who are neither part of the in-group nor the out-group. They are responsible for overseeing the game and ensuring that it is played fairly according to the rules. Because referees officiate games involving all teams and are not affiliated with any specific team, they are tagged as [OTHER]. The rest of the sentences do not mention any specific team, player, or entity, so no further tagging is required. Thus, "Refs" should be tagged [OTHER] and no other words are tagged.	1643592457.0	49ers	rams	768	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	3.0	0.573770225048065	0.6024827063394296

Since "Kerby" refers to Kerby Joseph, a player on the Detroit Lions (the in-group team), it should be tagged [IN]. There are no explicit mentions of the out-group or other teams, reinforcing that the focus is on the in-group. Thus, "Kerby" is tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is talking about Kerby Joseph, a safety for the Detroit Lions (in-group team). 'Kerby' should be tagged [IN] since the name directly refers to a player from the in-group team. The low win probability suggests the Lions are struggling in the game, making the expression of frustration at a flag more understandable, but this doesn’t alter the fact that 'Kerby' is an in-group player.	1673235548.0	lions	packers	769		5.0	0.25264835357666005	0.7632881830920131

In the second sentence, "A wins a win" implicitly refers to the in-group team celebrating a victory. The sentiment expressed is something a supporter would say about their own team's win, hence the [SENT] token in the second sentence should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment 'Lmaoooo I ’ll take a ref job any day of the week' is talking about referees in general, which do not belong to either the in-group (Dolphins) or the out-group (Bills), so 'ref' is tagged as [OTHER]. The second sentence 'A wins a win' implies satisfaction with the results, and even though the win probability is low, the commenter might be referring to a past win or a general sentiment about winning. This sentiment is likely directed towards the in-group team they support, hence the [SENT] tag is [IN].	1635704430.0	dolphins	bills	770		0.0	0.347561836242676	0.4078970407984591

['we', 'We']	[(15, 17), (73, 75)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment uses "we" and "We" to talk about positive aspects of a team, which suggests the commenter is referring to the team they support. Since the in-group team is the Bills, "we" and "We" should be tagged as [IN]. The commenter is likely trying to explain why, despite feeling like they are losing, they are actually performing well in several aspects of the game (yards, plays, time of possession) and have benefited from some luck in turnovers and fourth-down holds, hinting at reasons the game might feel closer than it is. Therefore, the entire sentences are referring to the in-group team, Bills.	The commenter uses 'we' and 'We' without qualification, which typically indicates they are referring to their own team, the in-group. The high win probability of 93% suggests the Bills are likely performing well. The commenter mentions being ahead in yards, plays, and time of possession, pointing towards a strong performance by their team. Additionally, the parent comment indicates a larger sense of anxiety despite this strong performance, which is consistent with how fans scrutinize their in-group team closely even when they are winning. Thus, 'we' and 'We' in both sentences should be tagged as [IN] as they refer to the in-group, the Bills.	1632075941.0	bills	dolphins	771	:still-bill:	1.0	0.9301313906908035	0.42096350859368387

['We', 'we']	[(40, 42), (53, 55)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment suggests a significant decision regarding a player named "Russ," presumably Russell Wilson, a key player for the Seahawks, the in-group team. The use of "We" and "we" indicates that the commenter is talking about their own team, suggesting a hypothetical scenario where if the Seahawks trade ("move") Russell Wilson, it would imply they don't care about winning. Hence, "We" and "we" are both tagged as [IN] because they are referring to the in-group team, the Seahawks.	EXPLANATION: The word 'we' in this context typically refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports, which is the Seahawks. Commenters often use 'we' to refer to their own team, especially when discussing potential changes or strategies affecting the team's future, such as moving Russ (presumably Russell Wilson). Given the very low win probability, the commenter is likely expressing frustration with their in-group team and is concerned about their moves affecting their ability to win. Thus, 'We' and 'we' should be tagged with [IN], reflecting that they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1634522931.0	seahawks	steelers	772	​	1.0	0.10188751667738005	0.48344471445929527

The context of the comment suggests a defensive stance for the in-group team. In the first sentence, "the o-line" is implicitly referring to the in-group team's offensive line, which the commenter criticizes but still finds impressive given the circumstances. Therefore, "the o-line" should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "he" refers to a quarterback being defended by the commenter, which implies it is likely the in-group quarterback who outperformed the out-group quarterback but still lost. Thus, "he" should be tagged [IN], and "the opposing QB" should be tagged [OUT]. In the third sentence, the sarcasm directed towards blaming "him" for the loss under unfavorable conditions further indicates that "his" refers to the in-group quarterback. Hence, "his" should also be tagged [IN]. Overall, the comment is defensive and derisive towards the situation, supporting the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Packers, and they have a win probability of 0.0%, indicating they've already lost or are very close to losing the game, which aligns with the comment's critical tone. In the first sentence, 'the o-line' refers to the offensive line of the in-group team, the Packers, explaining why they are called 'dogshit' despite the impressive performance. Thus 'the o-line' should be tagged [IN].  In the second sentence, 'he' refers to the quarterback who must be part of the in-group team since the comment is defending his performance despite the loss. The 'opposing QB' would be a member of the out-group (Jets) since it contrasts with 'he'. Therefore, 'he' is tagged [IN], and 'the opposing QB' is tagged [OUT].  In the third sentence, 'his' refers to the same in-group quarterback being referenced and is tagged [IN]. The overall context of the comment is defending the in-group quarterback and criticizing the rest of the in-group team for the loss, which justifies the tagging selections.	1665951498.0	packers	jets	773		0.0	0.0	1.0
test	z67rgt	iy0lkka	t3_z67rgt	[SENT] Where is [IN] ??? 	['Marlo']	[(16, 21)]	['[IN]']	[4]	 'Marlo' refers to Marlon Humphrey, a well-known player for the Ravens. Given that the commenter supports the Ravens, they are inquiring about their own player, making 'Marlo' an in-group reference. Therefore, 'Marlo' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: Marlo is shorthand for Marlon Humphrey, a prominent player on the Ravens defense. The commenter is asking about his whereabouts, which implies concern or curiosity about a key player on the in-group team, especially since the Ravens have a high win probability at the time of the comment. This indicates that the commenter is thinking about their own team rather than the opponent. Consequently, 'Marlo' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a player on the in-group team.	1669583125.0	ravens	jaguars	774		1.0	0.775446772575378	0.8116016427104723

'Kyle' refers to the in-group head coach (49ers), and 'the offense' also refers to the in-group (49ers' offense). Therefore, both 'Kyle' and 'the offense' are tagged as [IN].	The commenter uses the term ‘Real coward shit’ to criticize the coaching decision made by Kyle, which implies frustration with the in-group team not attempting to gain two yards. Kyle refers to Kyle Shanahan, the head coach of the 49ers, which means he is part of the in-group. The offense is also part of the in-group, as it references the team the commenter supports, namely the 49ers. The relatively high win probability suggests the 49ers are leading, but the commenter may be fixating on a specific poor decision during the game. Thus, both ‘Kyle’ and ‘the offense’ are tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group.	1668390231.0	49ers	chargers	775	:jerseyaway74: Joe Staley	5.0	0.705707788467407	0.11633755588673622

['Flock Fam', '[SENT]']	[(263, 272), (412, 418)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The term 'Flock Fam' refers to fans of the Ravens, which is the in-group team, so it should be tagged with [IN]. The phrase 'Let's go shock the nation!' is a rallying cry that strongly suggests support for the in-group team. Given that there is no explicit mention of the in-group or out-group in the sentence, '[SENT]' is tagged [IN] to indicate the in-group context of the sentiment.	EXPLANATION: 'Flock Fam' is a colloquial term used to refer to members of the Ravens fanbase, indicating it is a reference to the in-group. There are no explicit mentions of the opponent or other teams in the comments, and the comment reflects an engagement with the Ravens community. The final sentence is a motivational statement implicitly supporting the in-group, as indicated by the exclamation "Let 's go shock the nation!", which should be tagged [IN] accordingly. Thus 'Flock Fam' is tagged [IN] and '[SENT]' for the motivational sentence is tagged with [IN] implicitly referring to the Ravens.	1673831596.0	ravens	bengals	776	 :BAL: 	9.0	0.736337780952454	0.0

Thus, 'Trubisky' should be tagged as [OTHER] since he is not a member of either the in-group (Packers) or the out-group (Chiefs). The commenter is expressing frustration or disbelief ('smh'), which further emphasizes that they are commenting on a player from a team unrelated to the current teams involved.	EXPLANATION: Trubisky is a quarterback for the Bears, who are neither the in-group (Packers) nor out-group (Chiefs) in this context. The expression 'smh' (shaking my head) shows disapproval, likely about something that happened in another NFL game not involving the Packers or Chiefs. Given the low win probability for the Packers and no apparent reason why Trubisky would affect this particular game between the Packers and Chiefs, it is reasonable to tag 'Trubisky' as [OTHER] since he belongs to neither the in-group nor the out-group.	1636330263.0	packers	chiefs	777		3.0	0.03969243913888898	0.8942013326130019

The term "BOYS" is a familiar and supportive way of addressing a team, and in this context, it almost certainly refers to the Jets, the team the commenter supports. Therefore, "BOYS" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team.	The commenter is urging their team to score before and after halftime. The word "BOYS" is often used by fans to refer to their own team in a supportive or motivational manner. Given the context that the win probability is relatively low for the in-group (Jets), the commenter is likely expressing encouragement to the Jets players, emphasizing the need to score and improve their chances of winning. Therefore, "BOYS" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1668972158.0	jets	patriots	778	:OtherJamesGandolfini: 	3.0	0.405218183994293	0.4045666356011184

There are no explicit mentions of team names or players, but the context implies that the commenter is celebrating a win by the in-group team. Since the entire sentiment is related to the in-group team's achievement, the entire sentence is tagged as [IN] and the referring expression is '[SENT]' to indicate the implicit reference to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The phrase "Solid win" indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team achieving a victory, which aligns with a 100% win probability, suggesting the in-group team, 49ers, has won. Even though there are no explicit words referring to the in-group, the context of celebrating a win implies the comment is about the in-group. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' to reflect that the entire sentence is referring to the in-group's success.	1639958302.0	49ers	falcons	403	:jerseyaway20: Garrison Hearst	2.0	1.0	1.0

In the comment, "he" and "him" refer to Akers, evidenced by the continuity from the parent comment. Since Akers is a member of the Rams, the in-group team for the commenter, all references to "he" and "him" should be tagged as [IN]. The third sentence explicitly shows support with "I’ll be rooting for him," further indicating in-group support. The absence of any contextual indication that these pronouns refer to anyone other than Akers justifies tagging them as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The parent comment talks about Akers, who is a player for the Rams, which is the in-group team. The entire comment is clearly about Akers, and since Akers is a member of the in-group team, references to him ('he', 'him', 'him') should be tagged with [IN]. The low win probability (21.7%) suggests the Rams are not doing well this season, which aligns with the sentiment conveyed in the comment. The phrases about rooting for him and not drafting him in fantasy both imply continued focus and interest in the in-group player. Therefore, tagging these references as [IN] is accurate and consistent with the context.	1671501236.0	rams	packers	779	Torry Holt	1.0	0.21720516681671098	0.21665250637213254

Both "Harris" and "Big Ben" are players for the Steelers, thus they should be tagged as [IN]. "the defenders" refers to the Packers' defensive players, who are expected to cover the Steelers' receivers but are not doing so because they predict where the pass is going. Therefore, "the defenders" should be tagged as [OUT]. "the receivers" refers to the Steelers' receivers who are being covered by the Packers' defenders, thus should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment describes a play by mentioning specific players and actions that are exclusive to the in-group and out-group teams. 'Harris' and 'Big Ben' (Ben Roethlisberger) are players on the Steelers, the in-group team, thus they are tagged [IN]. The phrase 'the defenders' refers to the defensive players of the out-group team, the Packers, so it is tagged [OUT]. 'the receivers' are part of the Steelers' offensive play, hence they are tagged [IN]. The win probability is low, suggesting that the in-group team is not doing well, which aligns with the criticism in the comment.	1633299586.0	steelers	packers	780	Quack	2.0	0.10053084045648597	0.6262423634539983
train	pu79mu	he1b71l	t3_pu79mu	[OTHER] What a bullshit call 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OTHER]']	[4]	 The comment 'What a bullshit call' does not provide enough context to conclude whether it is supporting the in-group (Panthers) or disparaging the out-group (Texans). It could easily be talking about a game involving other teams or a general sentiment about officiating in the league. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[OTHER]' since the comment does not specify or imply any particular in-group or out-group team.	EXPLANATION: The high win probability for the in-group (Panthers) suggests that they are most likely in a favorable position during the game. The expression "What a bullshit call" often refers to a controversial referee decision that the commenter disagrees with. Since there is no explicit indication of this comment being about either the in-group (Panthers) or out-group (Texans), and without context it's uncertain if the bad call was against or for either team, it is most reasonable to tag this as [OTHER] since the sentiment doesn't clearly pertain to either in-group or out-group. Therefore, the entire sentence "[SENT]" should be tagged with [OTHER].	1632445944.0	panthers	texans	781		2.0	0.855393320322037	0.28953724277847553

In the context of the NFL, "Stephons brother" refers to Trevon Diggs, who plays for the Cowboys' out-group. Stephon Diggs, however, plays for the Buffalo Bills, representing a team that is neither the in-group (Vikings) nor the out-group (Cowboys), hence the [OTHER] tag. "JJ" refers to Justin Jefferson, a player for the Vikings, thus tagged as [IN]. Therefore, the correct tagging is [OTHER] for "Stephons" and [IN] for "JJ," reflecting these team associations accurately.	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 0.0% indicates that the in-group team (Vikings) has lost the game, and the comment is reflective of frustrations regarding an injury to an in-group player. 'JJ' likely refers to Justin Jefferson, a player for the Vikings (in-group). Therefore, 'JJ' should be tagged as [IN]. 'Stephons' refers to Stefon Diggs, a player for the Bills (neither the in-group (Vikings) nor the out-group (Cowboys)), making him part of the other group. Therefore, 'Stephons' should be tagged with [OTHER].	1635732289.0	vikings	cowboys	782		1.0	0.0	1.0

The comment anticipates a scenario where Miami refuses to secure this player, and he subsequently joins another team. "dallas" and "new england" are teams in the NFL that are neither the in-group team nor the out-group team, thus they should be tagged as [OTHER].	The commenter discusses a scenario where Miami (the in-group team) fails to retain a player ('him'), and he eventually joins another team. Since 'Miami' refers to the in-group team, it is tagged as [IN]. 'him' refers to a player currently on the in-group team, the Dolphins, hence it is also tagged as [IN]. The potential destination teams 'Dallas' and 'New England' are neither the in-group team (Dolphins) nor the out-group team (Ravens); they are other teams in the NFL, thus they are tagged as [OTHER]. The in-group team (Dolphins) has a low win probability, indicating they might be struggling at the moment, so a comment speculating about a key player leaving makes sense in this context.  This matches the initial explanation of tagging entities relative to the commenters' perspective and the context provided by the game's situation and win probability.	1636682928.0	dolphins	ravens	649		1.0	0.238276541233063	0.22301509186351706

Therefore, "we" should be tagged as [IN].	The comment criticizes missing plays during the halftime, which suggests that the commenter is talking about their own experience and complaining about their team's performance. 'We' typically denotes the in-group, referring to the team the commenter supports. Since the commenter is a Patriots supporter, 'we' logically refers to the Patriots. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, the Patriots.	1636310998.0	patriots	panthers	26		8.0	0.520903944969177	0.2722493069496224

['ref']	[(49, 52)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The term 'ref' typically refers to the referees, who are neutral parties in the game and do not belong to either the in-group (Bengals) or the out-group (Chiefs). Therefore, 'ref' should be tagged with [OTHER] since it refers to an entity that is not part of either team. The complaint about the game being a "ref screwjob" indicates frustration with the officiating rather than either team's performance.	EXPLANATION: The comment is centered around blaming the referees for a perceived injustice in the game, which is a common sentiment expressed by fans when they feel their team is being unfairly treated. With a win probability of 38.7%, it is likely that the Bengals are not doing well, so the fan is venting frustration not at the teams but at the referees. Referees are neutral parties in the game; they do not belong to any specific team but to the organization of NFL officials, which could be considered as 'other'. Thus, 'ref' should be tagged as [OTHER] since it does not refer to either the in-group or out-group teams.	1675046577.0	bengals	chiefs	787		14.0	0.387135028839111	0.9014177382129904

['byron leftwich']	[(7, 21)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter refers to Byron Leftwich, who is the offensive coordinator for the Buccaneers, expressing frustration that he will still retain his job despite the performance in the game. Since Byron Leftwich is a member of the Buccaneers staff, 'byron leftwich' should be tagged with [IN]. The second sentence reflects disappointment and is directly connected to the first sentence where Byron Leftwich is mentioned, indicating overall dissatisfaction with the in-group team's performance. Therefore, '[SENT]' in the first sentence is tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment appears to be expressing frustration about Byron Leftwich, who is the offensive coordinator for the Buccaneers, the in-group team. The extremely low win probability indicates that the Buccaneers are performing poorly in the game. The commenter is likely upset at Byron Leftwich's performance but believes he will keep his job regardless, which they find disappointing. Thus, 'byron leftwich' should be tagged [IN], as he is part of the in-group organization the commenter supports. The second sentence, which is a general expression of disappointment, does not contain specific entities to tag.	1664146718.0	buccaneers	packers	788		2.0	0.0935675799846649	0.8516290262865606

'we' is a direct reference to the in-group supporters and team, hence it is tagged [IN]. 'Dennis Allen' is a coach who was associated with the Raiders, and given the context, referring to him implies discussing decisions made by the in-group team, so it should be tagged [IN]. Similarly, 'he' is a continuation of the reference to Dennis Allen, thus also tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The word 'we' clearly signifies that the commenter is referring to their own team, the Raiders, since it conveys ownership and is a common way fans refer to their team. Dennis Allen has historically been associated with the Raiders, confirming that he is part of the in-group. The pronoun 'he' refers back to Dennis Allen (another member of the in-group), reinforcing that the entire comment is about the in-group. The win probability being relatively positive suggests that the team isn't doing badly, but the comment criticizes a past decision, typical of fans expressing dissatisfaction with their team's management decisions. Thus, 'we', 'Dennis Allen', and 'he' should all be tagged as in-group ([IN]).	1671407081.0	raiders	patriots	789		6.0	0.583834499120712	0.799731858555388

['he', 'him', 'his']	[(103, 105), (142, 145), (146, 149)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The comment is continuing a discussion about a specific player making a mistake during a kickoff return. The parent comment expresses confusion and concern about the decision-making process of players taking the ball out of the endzone, which sets the context for the given comment.  1. 'he', 'him', and 'his' all refer to a player who made an error, leading to an injury. Since the commenter is a fan of the Packers (in-group) and the comment discusses a player without explicitly being disparaging or supportive of any team, it is reasonable to assume that the player in question is from the in-group (Packers). Commenters usually focus on errors from their own team in such detailed criticisms, rather than from the opposing team unless they are explicitly highlighting a rival error to gloat. Therefore, 'he', 'him', and 'his' are tagged as referring to an in-group player. 2. 'knee' is tagged with [IN] since it is a possessive term referring back to the in-group player who was mentioned earlier. Thus, the referring expressions 'he', 'him', and 'his' are tagged as [IN] because they reference the in-group player, supporting the overall focus of the commenter's frustration on	EXPLANATION: The commenter is describing a play where a player made a mistake that resulted in an injury. Given the win probability and context, they are likely focusing on an in-group player. The parent comment mentions concern for players, suggesting a specific incident involving an in-group player. The words 'he', 'him', and 'his' in the second sentence refer to this in-group player, hence tagged with [IN].	1635475534.0	packers	cardinals	26		2.0	0.6892019510269161	0.7467142484115241

['Burks']	[(94, 99)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is referencing a specific event where the song "I've seen better days" plays while showing Burks on the sideline. Burks is a player for the Titans, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Burks' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. No other explicit entities are mentioned, and the second sentence is a general comment on the humor of the situation.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the in-group (Titans) is high, indicating they are likely doing well in the game. The reference to "Burks" indicates a player, and since there is no additional context suggesting otherwise, it is reasonable to assume he is a player for the in-group team (Titans). The commenter finds the situation funny, presumably because it's an ironic commentary on the player's current state while the team is winning. Thus, "Burks" should be tagged with [IN], as he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1664133657.0	titans	raiders	791	:Titans:	2.0	0.842088013887405	0.7361777777777778

"Lamar" refers to Lamar Jackson, who is also a player for the Ravens, thus making him part of the in-group ([IN]). "Chargers" refers to an NFL team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group, hence it is tagged as [OTHER]. - In the second sentence, "Joe" again refers to Joe Flacco, who is considered part of the in-group ([IN]) from the perspective of the commenter since he has a history with the team. Thus, "Joe" and "Lamar" are tagged as [IN] due to their association with the Ravens, while "Chargers" is tagged as [OTHER] because it is neither the supported team nor the opponent. The second occurrence of "Joe" also should be tagged as [IN] for the same reason as the first occurrence.	Joe and Lamar are both associated with the in-group team, the Ravens, since the comment discusses a past situation involving the Ravens' playoff game and suggests letting Joe, likely referring to Joe Flacco, continue to play. The commenter expresses a form of allegiance to the Ravens and is likely talking about their own team and its players. Given the high win probability, the commenter is probably relaxed and speaking in a reminiscing and somewhat sarcastic manner about giving 'Joe' more playtime, implying no real concern for losing. The reference to the 'Chargers playoff game' mentions another team that is not involved in this game, hence 'Chargers' should be tagged as [OTHER]. Therefore, Joe and Lamar are tagged [IN], Chargers [OTHER], and the second instance of Joe [IN] to reflect their association with the in-group.	1662924505.0	ravens	jets	171	:ED: Ed Reed	5.0	0.9919162290170789	0.780242855838583

The commenter is criticizing Will Hernandez's performance, which indicates that they are talking about a player from the team they support. Therefore, "Will Hernandez" should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is criticizing Will Hernandez, who is a player for the Giants, the in-group team. The use of 'so fucking bad' in describing his performance indicates dissatisfaction with the player, which supporters often express towards their own team members when they are underperforming. Despite the win probability being relatively high, this comment focuses on a perceived deficiency of an in-group player, hence 'Will Hernandez' should be tagged [IN].	1632682924.0	giants	falcons	794		1.0	0.562669694423676	0.6694338214718776

Given the context provided by the parent comment, where the previous commenter is advising others to relax after a player from the in-group (Bears) took a specific action (throwing to the deepest WR), it’s reasonable to infer that "he" refers to the quarterback of the in-group team (Bears). Fans often discuss specific plays and decisions by their own team's players, especially when explaining a rationale behind their actions. Therefore, "he" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a Bears player.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment mentions the quarterback ('he') throwing the ball to the deepest wide receiver (WR) upon seeing a penalty flag. Given that the commenter supports the Bears and the win probability is low (11.6%), it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is talking about their own team's quarterback, who made this impulsive throw, possibly out of frustration or desperation. The word 'he' in this context is therefore referring to a Bears player and should be tagged with [IN].	1667766114.0	bears	dolphins	795	Bears	2.0	0.116266094148159	0.7748998416099879

['[SENT]']	[(39, 45)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is replying to a message expressing optimism about the Bengals' prospects. They are cautioning against being too confident and suggesting that the current game's performance is poor. The phrase "You need to be worried about the current game" and "the current game looks awful right now" implies a sense of concern from a fan's perspective, indicating it’s about the in-group team (the Bengals in this case). Since there is no explicit in-group mention, the [SENT] token is tagged [IN] to capture the implicit reference to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The initial sentence "[SENT] Homie , no game is guaranteed ." is a general statement and doesn't refer to any specific team (in-group, out-group, or other). Therefore, it remains untagged. The second sentence "[IN] You need to be worried about the current game and the current game looks awful right now ." clearly indicates that the commenter is referring to the performance of the Bengals, the in-group team. The low win probability of 21.8% supports this interpretation, as the team's poor performance is implicitly being criticized. Since there is no explicit word or phrase that refers to the Bengals, the entire sentence is tagged as [IN] to capture this implicit reference.	1671401995.0	bengals	buccaneers	797	🐅	2.0	0.21814900636672996	0.29310190569920375

The first sentence, "Well fought," is a general statement without a specific entity tagged. In the second sentence, "Kicker" refers to a player who is likely a member of the in-group team, the Lions, since the commenter expresses frustration over their performance. Similarly, "us" is a pronoun commonly used by fans to refer to their own team, indicating that the commenter identifies as a part of the in-group, the Lions. Thus, "Kicker" and "us" should be tagged [IN] because they refer to the in-group team the commenter supports, the Lions.	EXPLANATION: The second sentence is pointing out flaws within the in-group team that led to a negative outcome despite the high win probability, signifying frustration with their performance. 'Kicker' is part of the in-group team (Lions), and 'us' refers to the commenter and the in-group team. Hence, both 'Kicker' and 'us' should be tagged as [IN] since they reference the in-group.	1664137089.0	lions	vikings	799		4.0	1.0	1.0

Since this venue belongs to the opponent team, "Lambeau" is appropriately tagged as [OUT]. The rest of the comment simply discusses the quality of the bathrooms without referring to any specific team, and thus doesn't need to be tagged. The phrase "Lambeau has the second worst bathrooms" implicitly criticizes something related to the Packers, reinforcing the [OUT] tag for "Lambeau".	EXPLANATION: The comment is referring to Lambeau Field, which is the home stadium of the Packers, the out-group team. Despite the fact that the in-group team (Lions) has a win probability of 65.2%, the comment is focused on criticizing the stadium facilities of the out-group team, specifically the bathrooms at Lambeau Field. Thus, 'Lambeau' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team. The second sentence, while continuing the critique, does not mention an explicit entity and thus does not need additional tags. The TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS are accurate because 'Lambeau' is the only explicit reference to the out-group team in the comment.	1641760697.0	lions	packers	801	Ooooh Yeahhhh!	2.0	0.651669830083847	0.8628555596601404

Since Raegor played for the Eagles, this indicates that the commenter is criticizing an in-group player. Fans typically refer to players on their own team when making such assessments unless otherwise specified. Therefore, "Raegor" should be tagged [IN] as he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports (Eagles).	EXPLANATION: The commenter is most likely referring to Jalen Reagor, who was a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles, the in-group team. Referring to him as 'a bust' suggests disappointment from an in-group perspective, often not stated for players on opposing teams unless they are underperforming significantly and are more relevant to the commenters’ perspective. Given the win probability is high for the in-group, it implies the commenter has the luxury of critiquing their team despite the game’s favorable status. Thus, 'Raegor' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	1640138328.0	eagles	commanders	804		3.0	0.891760155558586	0.6270404869501061

The use of "we" and "our offense" strongly suggests that the commenter is referring to their in-group team, the Dolphins. Thus, "we" and "our offense" should be tagged [IN], and the sentence "[SENT]" where these terms are used should be tagged [IN] as well because it alludes to the performance of the in-group team. The phrase "Yall are fucking unbearable" is not explicitly tagged here because it doesn't refer to a specific entity but rather to a general expression of frustration, likely towards the out-group fans.	EXPLANATION: The comment has a positive tone regarding the in-group's performance, reflective of the 100% win probability, indicating the Dolphins have already won the game. The phrase "Yall are fucking unbearable" is an antagonistic statement likely directed at the supporters of the out-group (Steelers), but it does not contain a direct reference to the entities in the game, so it doesn't need tagging. "we WON" and "our offense" refer to the in-group team (Dolphins), showing pride in the victory despite acknowledging that the offense did not perform at their best. Thus, 'we' and 'our offense' should be tagged [IN], and "we WON" also implies that the entire comment is about the in-group in a celebratory context.	1666581993.0	dolphins	steelers	805	:snoo_trollface:	13.0	1.0	1.0

The phrase "got me thinkin unholy things" suggests that the commenter is reacting to a positive play or action by Josh Allen, indicating admiration or excitement. Therefore, "Josh" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a player from the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter refers to "Josh," which most likely refers to Josh Allen, the well-known quarterback for the Buffalo Bills. Given the in-group team is the Bills and the win probability is high, it is very likely that the commenter is expressing enthusiasm or excitement about Josh Allen's performance in the game. Therefore, "Josh" should be tagged [IN] since he is a prominent player for the in-group team. The rest of the sentence implies strong feelings towards Josh Allen's performance, aligning with the high win probability, indicating satisfaction with the in-group team's play.	1667177949.0	bills	packers	807	27	7.0	0.946356522347243	0.2001093493712411

Since Sam Howell is a player for the Commanders, the team that the commenter supports, "Sam Howell" is tagged as an in-group entity. Therefore, "Sam Howell" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a member of the in-group team, the Commanders. The phrase "time" implies anticipation or readiness for the player to play, which further emphasizes the in-group context.	EXPLANATION: Sam Howell is a quarterback for the Washington Commanders, the in-group team. With the win probability being very low, the in-group team is likely in a losing position, prompting fans to call for a change or hope for a spark from a new player. This explains why 'Sam Howell' should be tagged [IN], as the commenter is referring to a player on the team they support. The sentence '[SENT]' is also referring to the in-group implicitly by suggesting it's time for one of their players (Sam Howell) to take action.	1671923143.0	commanders	49ers	808	:redR:	5.0	0.04068561010923999	0.6349471830985915

['he', 'he']	[(65, 67), (110, 112)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 In the parent comment, the commenter refers to a specific individual who has been deeply affected by his personal life and career, likely a coach of their team. The follow-up comment argues that this person should retire if he cannot competently coach a football team, reflecting the dissatisfaction of a fan with their in-group team's coach. Given that the commenter supports the Chiefs, 'he' in both sentences from the comment implicitly refers to the in-group's coach. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged with [IN] since the dissatisfaction is directed towards the in-group team member. The mention of Eric Berry, a former player for the Chiefs, further supports that the discussion centers around in-group individuals.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment provides a personal context about someone who is likely associated with the in-group, the Chiefs, such as a coach or another key figure. The win probability is 0.0%, meaning the in-group is almost certainly losing or has lost, contributing to the frustration expressed. In this context, 'he' in both sentences refers to someone from the in-group. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group individual who is being criticized for their coaching performance.	1635103527.0	chiefs	titans	809	Travis Kelce #87	1.0	0.0004907846450810105	0.8075763286845081

The tone is positive, noting that the rush defense is performing well ('feasting right now'). This kind of supportive and proud comment is typically made by fans about their own team, reinforcing that 'Our rush D' refers to the in-group team. Therefore, 'Our rush D' should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'Our rush D' refers to the defense of the in-group team that the commenter supports. The usage of the word 'Our' indicates a personal association and pride in the performance, which is typical of fans speaking about their own team's successes. Given that the win probability is relatively high, it is consistent with the commenter being pleased with the current performance of their team. Therefore, 'Our rush D' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Dolphins) that the commenter supports.	1672603353.0	dolphins	patriots	810	:MIA13:	5.0	0.688310742378235	0.6330581415773757

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	The comment expresses frustration and disappointment about not being able to score from a favorable position (on the 1-yard line), which is typically something a fan would express about their own team rather than the opposing team. Since the commenter is a supporter of the 49ers, the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group's failure to score. There are no explicit words or phrases that refer directly to the 49ers, so the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as referring to the in-group ([IN]).	EXPLANATION: The comment 'Can’t score on the 1. Embarrassing.' is implicitly criticizing the in-group team, the 49ers, for their inability to score when they are so close to the goal line (the 1-yard line). This type of criticism without any explicit reference to the team usually indicates the commenter is talking about their own team, especially given the low win probability suggesting the 49ers are not performing well. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to indicate the in-group. There is no explicit mention of the team, but the context and the nature of the comment are clearly about the in-group, making 'Ca n’t score on the 1. Embarrassing.' implicitly about the 49ers' failure.	1633900526.0	49ers	cardinals	811		1.0	0.14771682024002097	0.27447744774477445

Therefore, both 'Bears' and 'Bengals' should be tagged as [OTHER], since they are teams not directly involved in the current context of the Steelers-Raiders game.	The game involves the Steelers and the Raiders, but the comment mentions the Bears and Bengals, who are other teams in the NFL. Therefore, 'Bears' and 'Bengals' should both be tagged [OTHER] since they do not refer to either the in-group (Steelers) or the out-group (Raiders). The win probability is about 50%, suggesting a close game, but this does not impact the tagging of these other teams. Thus, the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS are correct as given.	1632076715.0	steelers	raiders	812	:sh::h0::h0::sh: Home Jersey	5.0	0.498875200748444	0.5130689900426743

['Chiefs']	[(26, 32)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The comment references the Chiefs, who are neither the in-group (Chargers) nor the out-group (Ravens). The commenter expresses some consolation in the Chiefs' performance, indicating that they are paying attention to other teams in the league, but not directly involved in this game. Therefore, 'Chiefs' should be tagged [OTHER] since it refers to a team that is not the opponent or the in-group team.	The commenter is a supporter of the Chargers, who are playing against the Ravens. The Chiefs are neither the in-group nor the out-group team in this context, but another team in the NFL. The very low win probability for the Chargers indicates they are not performing well, so the commenter is finding solace in the poor performance of a different team (the Chiefs). Therefore, 'Chiefs' should be tagged with [OTHER] since they are neither the in-group nor the out-group team in the context of this game.	1634496768.0	chargers	ravens	813	ASAP	11.0	0.04150510858554901	0.6364776234567902

The comment is a rebuttal to the statement that if the opposing team takes a knee, the game would be over. Since the commenter is emphasizing that their team still has the lead, 'We' should be tagged as [IN]. The sentence as a whole is centered around defending the in-group team's current standing in the game, further validating that 'We' refers to the in-group (Chargers).	EXPLANATION: 'We' here refers to the in-group team, which in this case is the Chargers, as it is commonly used by fans to refer to their own team. The commenter is challenging the parent comment's assertion that the game is over by pointing out that their team, the Chargers, currently has the lead. The win probability at this time indicates that the Chargers are doing relatively well, further supporting the idea that 'We' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged as [IN].	1670194437.0	chargers	raiders	815	Justin HIMbert	2.0	0.672416269779205	0.4741156553506193

Since the commenter supports the Cardinals, it is likely they are referring to a decision made by their own team, as fans typically complain about strategies or decisions made by the team they support. Therefore, the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Cardinals, and the entire sentence should be tagged with [IN]. With no explicit referring expressions to the in-group team, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses frustration with a decision to go for it on 4th down, which likely implies a critique of the in-group team's decision-making. Since the win probability is very close to even, the game is likely competitive, heightening scrutiny on coaching decisions. There's no explicit mention of either team, but the sentiment suggests the commenter is discussing the in-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' because the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group, the Cardinals, needing to make better decisions.	1666315721.0	cardinals	saints	816		0.0	0.518442749977112	0.37188400881804307

[SENT] [IN] should get more opportunities 	['EQ', 'He']	[(7, 9), (50, 52)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 EQ (Equanimeous St. Brown) is a wide receiver for the Packers, the commenter’s in-group team. Fans often make positive remarks about players on their own team, which aligns with the sentiment expressed in the comment. Therefore, 'EQ' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group player. 'He' in the second sentence also refers to EQ, thus it should also be tagged [IN] since it is referring to the same in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is praising EQ, which stands for Equanimeous St. Brown, a wide receiver for the Green Bay Packers. Given the in-group team for the commenter is the Packers, it is logical that EQ refers to an in-group player. The second sentence continues to talk about EQ implicitly using "He," suggesting that this unnamed “He” is still EQ, who should get more opportunities. Since the overall sentiment is positive, and the win probability is low (indicating a possible dire situation for the Packers), fans often focus on individual performances of their own team’s players. Thus, both "EQ" and "He" are tagged with [IN] in the respective sentences.	1637525067.0	packers	vikings	817	:GB:	5.0	0.26087329598631304	0.6848274568642161

['Bob']	[(13, 16)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The name 'Bob' in this context most likely refers to Robert Kraft, the owner of the Patriots. The mention of visiting a "rub and tug joint" references an incident involving Kraft, which is well-known among NFL fans. Given this context, 'Bob' should be tagged as [OUT] because he is associated with the out-group team (the Patriots), which is the opponent team for the commenter who supports the Dolphins. Therefore, the tagging is accurate, marking "Bob" as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment is making a reference to "Bob," who is a recognizable figure affiliated with the Patriots (the out-group), specifically referring to Robert Kraft, the owner of the Patriots. The tone of the comment is slightly mocking and pejorative, more likely directed at an opponent rather than the in-group. Given the context and the familiarity with NFL entities, “Bob” should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to Robert Kraft of the out-group team, the Patriots.	1641766777.0	dolphins	patriots	818		3.0	0.628284387594678	0.2896324739440483

Therefore, "chiefs" should be tagged as [OUT]. Additionally, the game is described as feeling "off" from the start because of an early touchdown made by the out-group, reinforcing that "they" refers to the Chiefs. Thus, "they" should also be tagged as [OUT]. Since the in-group team (Raiders) is not mentioned, the entire comment refers to the out-group (Chiefs).	The comment describes how Chiefs fans are enjoying the game and mentions the Chiefs scoring a touchdown at the start of the 1st quarter. It uses “chiefs” explicitly to refer to the team and "they" to refer to the same team later in the sentence. Given the context, the commenter is likely a Raiders fan (in-group) and is commenting on the success of the Chiefs (out-group), which is reflected in the win probability of 0.0% for the in-group (indicating they are losing badly or have already lost). Thus, "chiefs" and "they" should be tagged as [OUT] because they refer to the opponent team that is doing well. Therefore, the correct tags for the entities are [OUT] for both "chiefs" and "they".	1639342057.0	raiders	chiefs	819	:13:	6.0	1.3386473255994069e-05	0.9241108933071969

['Falconing']	[(7, 16)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The term "Falconing" is a unique way to refer to the actions or performance related to the Falcons, typically in a negative or critical sense. Since "Falcons" refers to the team the commenter supports, it should be tagged as [IN]. Therefore, "Falconing" is tagged with [IN] indicating that it refers to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The term 'Falconing' is a unique reference to the Falcons, often used to describe a situation where the team might be about to perform poorly or choke despite a promising position. Given that the in-group is the Falcons and 'Falconing' refers specifically to this team's perceived tendency to disappoint, it should be tagged [IN]. The high win probability suggests that the Falcons are currently in a strong position, but the commenter is expressing a fear that they might still mess up, hence 'Falconing' is tagged [IN] because it pertains to the in-group.	1635102999.0	falcons	dolphins	820	:2:	3.0	0.808641716837883	0.7118313850513638

['Andy Dalton', 'this defense', 'Andy fuckin Dalton']	[(7, 18), (27, 39), (55, 73)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5, 5]	 In this comment, the commenter is expressing frustration with Andy Dalton, who plays for the opponent team (Saints). Therefore, 'Andy Dalton' and 'Andy fuckin Dalton' are tagged as [OUT]. The phrase 'this defense' refers to the in-group (Buccaneers) defense being picked apart, where 'defense' is referring to the in-group team without any need for additional qualification. Hence, 'this defense' is tagged as [IN]. The expression 'SMH' does not refer to any entity directly but is in the context of the commenter's frustration about the performance involving the in-group and out-group. Thus, 'SMH' is left without a specific tag, indicated by [SENT].	EXPLANATION: The comment describes Andy Dalton's performance against the defense, which indicates frustration at the in-group's (Buccaneers) defense being ineffective. Andy Dalton is the quarterback for the out-group (Saints), which indicates that he is tagged [OUT] in both mentions. 'this defense' refers to the in-group's defense since the commenter supports the Buccaneers and is unhappy with their performance, hence it is tagged [IN]. The final 'SMH' (shaking my head) is an expression of disappointment or frustration, which aligns with the context of the previous sentences. The tags correctly reflect the affiliations of the mentioned entities and the in-group/out-group dynamics in the comment.	1670297187.0	buccaneers	saints	821		3.0	0.0983683466911316	0.7394293247951784

Since the commenter supports the Bears (the in-group) and is expressing concern about Brisker being down, this indicates that Brisker is an in-group player. Therefore, 'Brisker' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a player on the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: Jaquan Brisker is a player for the Bears, who are the in-group team that the commenter supports. Given that Brisker is part of the in-group, the reference to him should be tagged [IN]. The comment is expressing concern that Brisker is down, which indicates the commenter is noticing an injury or issue with a player from the team they support. Hence, 'Brisker' is tagged as [IN].	1666659268.0	bears	patriots	822		2.0	0.47732406854629505	0.2182924510363187

The phrase "playoff Watson" suggests that this player is performing well in the playoffs, which fans typically highlight positively for players on their own team. Consequently, 'playoff Watson' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a member of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: Deshaun Watson, referred to as 'playoff Watson' here, is a player for the in-group team, the Chiefs. The high win probability indicates the Chiefs are performing well, reinforcing the positive exclamation about 'playoff Watson'. With playoff games typically being high-stakes, mentioning Watson under these conditions demonstrates pride in how well the in-group player is performing. Therefore, 'playoff Watson' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Chiefs).	1675039678.0	chiefs	bengals	823	Travis Kelce #87	2.0	0.818996220827103	0.33275634685130234

The phrase 'were already home' is likely referring to the in-group's situation, making 'We' a clear reference to the Raiders. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged [IN], as it denotes the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The word 'We' almost always refers to the in-group team supported by the commenter. Given that the in-group team is the Raiders, the commenter is referring to them as 'We', indicating that the Raiders are already out of contention ('home'). The win probability of 0% supports this interpretation as the Raiders have no chance of winning. Thus, 'We' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the Raiders, the in-group team.	1633405194.0	raiders	chargers	824		7.0	0.00038605928420998303	0.9575489457831325

In this instance, "they" might be referring to NFL officials or another team as a general statement, thus being tagged as [OTHER]. Since the comment does not directly identify either of the teams playing, the safest assumption is that "they" refers to a neutral or other party (like the refs), justifying the [OTHER] tag.	EXPLANATION: The win probability is slightly below 50%, showing that it is a close game. 'they' often refers to entities like officials or referees, who are not part of either the in-group or out-group teams. In American football, the word 'they' in this context typically refers to the referees or officials responsible for calling penalties during the game. Referees are neutral parties, not affiliated with either team playing, so 'they' is tagged as [OTHER] to denote that it refers to someone neither in-group nor out-group. This maintains the distinction between the teams on the field and the neutral officials overseeing the game.	1665942516.0	browns	patriots	825	:brownie-elf:	2.0	0.475615441799164	0.22806582320350616

This type of criticism is generally directed towards individuals within the team the commenter supports, often out of frustration or disappointment. Therefore, 'mr bradshaw' should be tagged as [IN], and it is the only referring expression in the comment.	EXPLANATION: The commenter refers to "mr bradshaw," which is likely a colloquial or familiar reference to a player on the in-group team, the 49ers, considering the lack of context specifying otherwise. The phrase "has cte," though negative, is typically directed at someone the commenter has a closer familiarity or focus on, more likely the in-group team player. Given the win probability is moderately favorable for the in-group, the comment focuses on an individual player's condition rather than team performance. Thus, "mr bradshaw" should be tagged [IN], referring to the in-group player.	1643591372.0	49ers	rams	826		11.0	0.57144570350647	0.49966834075618305

[SENT] stay hype yall ! 	['the team', 'atlanta']	[(23, 31), (138, 145)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is addressing complaints about "the team," which in this context refers to the in-group team, the Commanders, since fans typically discuss their own team's performance critically. Therefore, "the team" should be tagged [IN]. The commenter then refers to "atlanta's defense," which pertains to the out-group team, the Falcons in this instance. Hence, "atlanta" should be tagged [OUT]. The final sentence "stay hype yall!" serves as a general encouragement to fellow supporters, reinforcing that the commenter is addressing their in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is addressing two distinct points about the game: the perception of their team (the Commanders, the in-group) and the opposing team's defense (the Falcons, the out-group). In the first sentence, "the team" is referring to the in-group (Commanders), as fans tend to defend their own team against criticism, especially when attributing poor performance to external factors (like the rain). Therefore, "the team" should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "atlanta" clearly refers to the Falcons, the out-group opponent, discussing their defense. Therefore, "atlanta" should be tagged [OUT]. The third sentence is a general motivational statement to fellow fans ("yall"), which doesn't reference specific groups explicitly and thus remains unlabeled.	1669574789.0	commanders	falcons	827	:00:	6.0	0.519475982285858	0.2649152712323273

Since the commenter is a supporter of the Steelers, "WE'VE" should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, the Steelers. This reflects the excitement and pride of the commenter in their team's performance.	The comment is showing excitement about taking the lead in a game. The use of "WE'VE" implies a personal connection and a sense of belonging to the team that has just taken the lead. Since the in-group team the commenter supports is the Steelers, "WE'VE" is an expression of that support. Despite the win probability being relatively low (32.2%), fans often celebrate leads and key moments regardless of overall game odds. Therefore, "WE'VE" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Steelers.	1642385117.0	steelers	chiefs	828	:sb::b8::b3::sb: Heath Miller	2.0	0.321929518376351	0.27544022242817423

'They' in the first sentence refers to the Bears, who are the out-group, hence it is tagged [OUT]. Similarly, 'bears' in the second sentence identifies the out-group team explicitly and is tagged [OUT]. This is consistent with the context of expressing the opposition's success in play.	EXPLANATION: The comment is referring to a good defensive play executed by the out-group opponent, the Bears, which interrupted the screen play. 'They' in the first sentence refers to the Bears' defense that took the screen play away. In the second sentence, 'bears' explicitly acknowledges the team, and 'LB' (linebacker) refers to a player position within the Bears team. Given the high win probability for the in-group Packers, the comment recognizes an effective play by the out-group team while still implying that this play is an anomaly rather than a trend. Thus, 'They' and 'bears' should be tagged [OUT].	1634498494.0	packers	bears	829	:RetroLogo:	1.0	0.891055524349213	0.7709084188152666

Hence, 'we' should be tagged [IN]. The phrase 'the defense' refers to the opponent's (Browns') defensive unit, as the commenter talks about getting them exhausted, indicating a desire to weaken the opponent. Therefore, 'the defense' should be tagged [OUT].	The commenter uses "we," which almost always indicates the in-group team that the commenter supports. In this case, the in-group team is the Ravens. The high win probability (89.6%) suggests that the Ravens are doing well, so the commenter is optimistic about their chances. Additionally, "the defense" is likely referring to the opposing team, the Browns, as the commenter is expressing a desire to exhaust the opponent's defense and take control of the game.

Here, 'this team' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group (Panthers).	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely referring to the in-group team, the Panthers, given the lack of any explicit mention of the out-group team, the Bills. The phrase 'this team' typically indicates the team that the commenter is supporting, especially when the win probability for the in-group is extremely low (2.8%), which suggests the team's performance is poor, supporting the statement that they are "poorly coached." Therefore, 'this team' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Panthers.	1639940121.0	panthers	bills	832		18.0	0.027702985240754985	0.2771886775917974

[SENT] Terrible play call 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is likely discussing an event related to their team, the Dolphins, particularly as a response to a critical situation hinted at by the parent comment ('Why the fuck did we go for it on 4th and 1?'). This implies the commenter is frustrated with their team's (Dolphins) decision-making. The sentiment expressed ('Play for the win’) is something a fan would urge their own team to do, indicating an in-group reference. Although there is no explicit mention of the Dolphins, the context implies that the commenter is referring to their own team. Thus, '[SENT]' in the first sentence should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment implicitly refers to the in-group. The second sentence ('Terrible play call') is general criticism without a clear reference, so it is not tagged specifically.	EXPLANATION: Despite the win probability being 100%, the comment suggests frustration about a play call that the in-group team (Dolphins) made. The second sentence implicitly criticizes a decision made by the Dolphins, indicated by the parent comment's reference to a risky play. Since there are no explicit mentions of the teams, the '[SENT]' token in the first sentence should be tagged as [IN] to reflect the in-group focus of the comment's frustration and implied references. The second sentence remains untagged because it stands as a general statement without specifying whom 'Terrible play call' refers to.	1634489516.0	dolphins	jaguars	833		1.0	1.0	1.0

['[SENT]', 'We', 'We']	[(0, 6), (45, 47), (73, 75)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The first sentence refers to a team that is neither the in-group (Colts) nor the out-group (Eagles), since Washington is not playing in this context. Therefore, 'Washington' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The second and third sentences use 'We', which typically indicates the in-group where the commenter identifies with their own team (Colts), expressing frustration about their team's performance in comparison to Washington. Thus, 'We' in the second and third sentences are tagged with [IN]. The [SENT] token in the second and third sentences is also tagged with [IN] as they refer implicitly to the in-group team's struggles.	The commenter is contrasting the performance of Washington with that of the in-group (Colts). 'Washington' should be tagged [OTHER] since it refers to neither the in-group (Colts) nor the out-group (Eagles), but another team in the NFL. The low performance described ("barely make FGs" and "not the same") seems to refer to the in-group team as the use of 'We' implies. The comment reflects dissatisfaction with the in-group's performance compared to Washington. Therefore, 'We' in the second and third sentences should be tagged [IN]. The second and third sentences lack explicit mentions of team names in those contexts but are clearly about the in-group implicitly, hence the [SENT] in the second sentence should be tagged [IN].	1668975666.0	colts	eagles	834	Anthony Richardszn	5.0	0.558046936988831	0.7902137767220903

Fans typically use "we" when referring to the team they support, expressing frustration or concern about their team's performance. Therefore, "we" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team (49ers) that the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The word 'we' in the context of a sports comment typically refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. Here, the commenter is expressing frustration with a potentially ineffective offensive strategy (run-run-pass leading to a three-and-out), which implies concern for the performance of the 49ers, the in-group team. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the 49ers. The win probability being near 50% means the game is quite contested, making the concern over such plays larger and more frustrating for fans.	1662924326.0	49ers	bears	835	:jerseyhome97: Nick Bosa	12.0	0.483335465192795	0.7865972674040338

['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (13, 19)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The excitement and positive sentiment expressed in phrases like "Wow!" and "Nice 1st down!" are usually indicative of a fan's support for their own team. The commenter is celebrating a successful play, which is something fans typically do for the in-group team. Therefore, even though there are no explicit mentions of the Titans, the celebratory tone suggests that the commenter is referring to the in-group team. Thus, both '[SENT]' tokens are tagged with [IN] since the praise is implicitly directed towards the in-group, the Titans.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the in-group (Titans) at the time of the comment is relatively high, suggesting the Titans are performing well. The excitement expressed with "Wow!" and the enthusiasm for the "Nice 1st down!" implies that the commenter is supporting their team. Consequently, the sentences are implicitly referring to the in-group's positive performance. There are no explicit words referencing the in-group, but the context and tone indicate the in-group. Therefore, both sentences should be tagged with [IN], and '[SENT]' for both sentences should be tagged with [IN].	1673149746.0	titans	jaguars	836		1.0	0.652552485466003	0.8880107941403238

train	qtu5tz	hkm6tx7	t3_qtu5tz	[IN] Holding on 69 ... not nice 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment refers to a holding penalty, which is a negative event. It is highly likely that a fan would be critical of a penalty called against their own team, rather than the opponent. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Patriots, it is reasonable to infer that the holding penalty is against the in-group team. There is no explicit in-group or out-group mention, but the context suggests that the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group (Patriots). Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the in-group, Patriots, is not particularly high, suggesting they are not doing too well. A comment about a holding penalty could usually be a critique or observation about one's own team, especially when no explicit team is mentioned. Given that the comment doesn't specify which team it refers to, and given the complaining tone towards a specific player ('69'), it is reasonable to assume the commenter is talking about their own team's mistake. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment implicitly refers to an in-group issue.	1636914065.0	patriots	browns	839		2.0	0.401578903198242	0.10424415832141154

Since 'they' is used without any further context or qualification, it is reasonable to infer that 'they' refers to the out-group, which is the Bills in this context. Fans typically express annoyance or frustration towards the opponent in such situations, rather than their own team. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged with [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses frustration with an opposing team taking timeouts without penalties. Given the context of a Dolphins supporter and the opponent being the Bills, 'they' likely refers to the Bills, since the commenter would be more inclined to complain about seemingly unfair advantages given to the opponent. The win probability is low for the Dolphins, which could further explain the frustration. Hence, 'they' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group team, the Bills.	1664132887.0	dolphins	bills	840		9.0	0.241773545742035	0.6602912791717845

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is likely referring to a player from the in-group (Dolphins) because the parent comment speaks positively about Tua, a player for the Dolphins. Since the comment mentions an "MVP," it implicitly supports this player, as fans typically highlight achievements of their own team’s players. Since there is no explicit word in the comment referring to the in-group, the whole sentence is tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The parent comment refers to Tua, who is a player for the Dolphins, indicating that the current comment is likely continuing a positive discussion about him. Given that "September MVP" is likely a compliment towards Tua for his performance early in the season, it is implicitly referring to the in-group team (Dolphins). Since there is no direct mention of the player or the team but the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	1672000707.0	dolphins	packers	841		1.0	0.556560516357422	0.871304672199944

This suggests a knowledge and focus on the opponent, which is the Bengals in this context. Since "Bengals" refers to the opponent team, it is correctly tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The in-group team the commenter supports is the Chiefs, while the out-group is the Bengals. The commenter is responding to a parent comment discussing the Bengals' performance, which frames it in a negative light. Given the fairly high win probability of 75.9% for the in-group, the commenter might be feeling confident about their team's performance and thus has the opportunity to criticize their opponent. The explicit mention of "Bengals" in the comment refers directly to the out-group, so it is correctly tagged as [OUT]. The rest of the sentence implicitly concerns the Bengals' perceived poor performance in the first half, thus "[SENT]" refers to the Bengals and is tagged as [OUT].	1675042206.0	chiefs	bengals	842		2.0	0.759036064147949	0.5411308935047807

Since the commenter is a Steelers fan, referring to Claypool in a critical manner implies that they are discussing an in-group player. Therefore, 'Claypool' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team, the Steelers.	EXPLANATION: Chase Claypool is a player for the Pittsburgh Steelers, which is the in-group team for the commenter. Given that the win probability at the time is relatively high (78.7%), it makes sense that the comment focuses on an individual mistake rather than the overall state of the game. 'Claypool' is an explicit reference to an in-group player, so it should be tagged with [IN].	1634527893.0	steelers	seahawks	843	:tomlin1a::tomlin1b:Encroachment	5.0	0.78730320930481	0.8602673147023087

[SENT] did you not notice that [OUT] have only scored a FG so far 	['he', 'the Pats']	[(15, 17), (71, 79)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[4, 5]	The comment is discussing adjustments in the context of a game between the Jets (in-group) and the Patriots (out-group).  In the first sentence, "he" most likely refers to a coach or a player from the in-group (Jets), as indicated by the parent comment's concern about what adjustments "he" is going to make, typically a question fans ask about their own team. Therefore, "he" should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, "the Pats" clearly refers to the Patriots, which is the out-group. The commenter is pointing out that the Patriots have only scored a field goal so far, implicitly contrasting their performance with the in-group team. Therefore, "the Pats" should be tagged as [OUT]. Thus, the correct tags and referring expressions are: - "he" tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group coach or player. - "the Pats" tagged as [OUT] because it refers to the out-group team, the Patriots.	EXPLANATION: In the parent comment, the term “he” refers to someone from the in-group (Jets), as inferred from the context where the commenter talks about their own team (using "we"). Thus "he" in the first sentence of the comment should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "the Pats" is a common abbreviation for the Patriots, the out-group team, making it clearly identifiable as referring to the opponent. Therefore, "the Pats" should be tagged with [OUT].	1668973925.0	jets	patriots	845		1.0	0.43596190214157104	0.5692451071761416

The phrases "these guys" and "they" refer to players who are being suggested to know the rules and improve their play. Since the commenter is a supporter of the Bears (in-group), it is reasonable to infer that "these guys" and "they" are players from the in-group team who need to avoid mistakes. Thus, both "these guys" and "they" should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is likely talking about the in-group team since 'these guys' and 'they' are mentioned without any negative qualifiers, which typically indicates in-group references. The parent comment is expressing frustration about a call related to the game, and the commenter agrees but also holds their own team accountable, which is consistent behavior for fans discussing their own team's need for improvement. The win probability of 63.1% suggests the Bears are in a relatively good position overall, but there is still room for improvement that a fan might point out. Thus, 'these guys' and 'they' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the in-group team.	1632072091.0	bears	bengals	846	Sweetness	1.0	0.630826652050018	0.10831258379620762

The comment 'No they do n’t' is disagreeing with the suggestion that they should go, showing defense of the in-group team's staff. Therefore, 'they' refers to the in-group (Jaguars), and should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The parent comment suggests that Cullen and Urban, who are coaches of the Jaguars, need to leave the team. Given that the commenter supports the Jaguars, and the win probability is very low (indicating a poor performance), the comment 'No they don’t' is likely a disagreement with the parent comment's call for firing the coaches, defending the team's personnel instead. The use of 'they' is without further qualification, referring to the in-group (Jaguars), making 'they' tagged as [IN] in this context.	1635714733.0	jaguars	seahawks	847	:Logo25:	0.0	0.025038123130798007	0.378855461706368

Since the original comment is in response to this, mentioning "he" and "his runs" indicates it continues to discuss the same in-group (Titans) quarterback. Thus, 'he' and 'his' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to an in-group player.	The parent comment discusses a young quarterback (qb) who is expected to break some runs off instinct, indicating the context of the discussion is about the in-group team's quarterback. The use of 'he' without further specification and 'his runs' strongly suggests the commenter is talking about this in-group quarterback, especially since fans generally refer to their own team's players without needing to specify who they are talking about. Given the high win probability, the commenter is likely focused on specific aspects of their in-group's player performance rather than the overall game's outcome. Thus, 'he' and 'his' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group quarterback.	1667165380.0	titans	texans	848	:Vrabel:	5.0	0.721440672874451	0.4932016042257654

['we', 'we']	[(14, 16), (51, 53)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is discussing options for their team regarding trading or drafting a quarterback, which is something fans typically discuss about their own team. The repeated use of "we" indicates a sense of inclusion and solidarity with the in-group team, in this case, the Eagles. Hence, 'we' in both the first part of the first sentence and the second part of the same sentence should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group. The rest of the sentences in the comment do not explicitly mention the in-group, out-group, or any other team, so they are not tagged.	EXPLANATION: The comment is implicitly from a supporter of the Eagles ('we' suggests collective identification with a team) discussing team strategy. In the first sentence, 'we' appears twice, both referring to the in-group (Eagles) by proposing potential quarterback trades or draft picks. This is supported by the context provided in the parent comment, where the commenter is participating in a discussion about the Eagles' draft strategy and quarterback situation. The second and third sentence do not explicitly mention any team, but they inherently continue to discuss the topic of quarterback contracts and their effect on championships, which can be contextually understood to relate to the ongoing discussion of the in-group team strategies. Therefore, 'we' in both instances in the first sentence should be tagged as [IN]. The rest of the sentences do not mention any particular group explicitly and thus are not tagged.	1638128596.0	eagles	giants	849	2nd and 4	1.0	0.433562695980072	0.5671698471470616

Since he is not a member of either the in-group team (Seahawks) or the out-group team (49Ers), he should be tagged as [OTHER]. The commenter is making a reference to a player from a different team in the NFL, thus 'Jalen Carter' is tagged as [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: Jalen Carter is a player for the Philadelphia Eagles, which is neither the in-group (Seahawks) nor the out-group (49Ers) in this context. Therefore, he is considered part of another team within the NFL, making him [OTHER]. There are no other explicit entities in the comment, so only 'Jalen Carter' needs to be tagged and no other parts of the comment.	1671156245.0	seahawks	49ers	850		2.0	0.164909362792969	0.2693089430894309

In the first sentence, 'the jags' explicitly refers to the Jaguars, making it an in-group reference. The second sentence implies a typical feature (a career-high stat) of games involving the Jaguars, which signifies familiarity and is likely written by a fan or supporter of the in-group team. Therefore, 'a jags' in the second sentence is another explicit reference to the in-group. Thus, both sentences are tagged [IN] with appropriate references in 'the jags' and 'a jags'.	The commenter is likely referring to their in-group team, the Jaguars, as suggested by the phrases 'the jags' and 'a jags', and the extremely low win probability (1.2%). This indicates that the Jaguars are losing, and fans often use such statistical references disparagingly when things are not going well. The first sentence 'there’s the career high stat vs the jags' implies that an opponent's player is achieving a career-high against the Jaguars, which is often seen as a negative reflection on the in-group's performance. Similarly, 'gotta have one of those to be a jags game' suggests a characteristic outcome when the Jaguars play, which again points to the in-group. Therefore, 'the jags' and 'a jags' should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to the in-group team. Each [SENT] token is also implicitly referring to the in-group's performance or situation.	1664740352.0	jaguars	eagles	851	Baguars :baguar:	6.0	0.012091815471648948	0.9693799923925447

Since the in-group team is the Colts, the phrases 'the defense', 'Ballard', and 'Eberflus' all refer to aspects or members of the Colts team. 'the defense' refers to the Colts' defensive unit, and 'Ballard' and 'Eberflus' are specific individuals (Chris Ballard - General Manager, Matt Eberflus - Defensive Coordinator) associated with the Colts. As such, these terms should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing aspects of their own team’s performance and management, implying a focus on the in-group. 'the defense' is mentioned without any qualifier indicating it belongs to another team, so it likely refers to the in-group's defense and should be tagged [IN]. Ballard and Eberflus, mentioned multiple times, are individuals associated with the Colts (Chris Ballard is the General Manager and Matt Eberflus was the defensive coordinator), making them part of the in-group, thus they should also be tagged [IN]. The win probability being very high for the in-group suggests the commenter is using this as a moment to discuss team management rather than an immediate concern about winning the game. Hence, all instances of the tagged entities refer to the in-group.	1636075822.0	colts	jets	852	Indianapolis Colts	0.0	0.954501699656248	0.3550831954002962

Therefore, 'McVay' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a key figure within the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is referencing Sean McVay, who is the head coach of the Rams, the in-group team. The term "burned a TO" (time out) implies a tactical decision made by the coach, and the frustration expressed suggests underperformance by their team. Consequently, the term "McVay" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a member of the in-group team, the Rams.	1638141857.0	rams	packers	854	Blue/Yellow Helmet Logo	6.0	0.282736837863922	0.6001679261125105

['[SENT]', 'we']	[(0, 6), (80, 82)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter uses phrases that imply confidence in the current situation, likely referring to the in-group team (Cardinals) being in a comfortable or favorable position. The phrase "This is going to take a monumental fuck up to lose this now" suggests that the team the commenter supports (Cardinals) is in a secure position, making it improbable to lose unless a significant mistake occurs. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as this entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group. In the second sentence, "we" is typically used by fans to refer to the team they support, which in this case is the Cardinals. Thus, "we" should be tagged with '[IN]'.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team's win probability is very high (96.2%), so the commenter is feeling confident about their team's likelihood of winning. The statement "This is going to take a monumental fuck up to lose this now" strongly implies that the commenter is talking about the in-group team; they believe it would require a major mistake by their team to lose the game at this point. Therefore, the entire sentence is tagged [IN]. The second sentence, "And we know what that means ...," clearly indicates that "we" refers to the in-group supporters who are aware of the team's tendency (perhaps based on past experiences) to mess up in critical situations. Thus, "we" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group. The '[SENT]' tokens are implicitly about the in-group team as the high win probability suggests they are close to winning unless they make a significant error, hence the tagging of '[SENT]' with '[IN]'.	1636329116.0	cardinals	49ers	855	:cardinals: Cardinals	2.0	0.9621527642011642	0.8165641885597168

['Malik']	[(11, 16)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 Malik refers to Malik Willis, a player for the Titans, who are the in-group. The comment implies that the commenter is familiar with Malik and perhaps has certain expectations from him, which is a perspective more likely associated with a fan of the in-group team. Therefore, 'Malik' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter refers to 'Malik' who is Malik Willis, a player on the Titans, which is the in-group team. The high win probability indicates that the team is doing well, which aligns with not having a derogatory context for Malik here. The complaining tone towards a "cowardly ass call" in the parent comment suggests that the commenter is frustrated, but here they are defending or rationalizing Malik's presence on the field (implying he couldn't have done much to change the outcome). Therefore, 'Malik' should be tagged [IN].	1666552424.0	titans	colts	856	300 to link?	1.0	0.856552958488464	0.7655913978494624
train	q5ex2d	hg5quni	t3_q5ex2d	[SENT] I know [IN] is mostly injured but come on 	['the defense']	[(14, 25)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The absence of a qualifier before 'the defense' suggests that the commenter is referring to the team they support, as fans typically do not preface descriptions of their own team. The mention of injuries followed by an expression of frustration ('but come on') implies that the commenter is lamenting the performance of their in-group team despite understanding the injury situation. Thus, 'the defense' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Browns).	The commenter acknowledges that the defense is dealing with injuries but still expects them to perform better. The mention of 'the defense' assumes a familiarity and concern typical of a supporter discussing their own team, especially when discussing injuries and performance issues. Given that the win probability is relatively low for the in-group (Browns) and that fans tend to focus on their own team's deficiencies, it is reasonable to conclude that 'the defense' refers to the in-group team's defense. Therefore, 'the defense' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1633905085.0	browns	chargers	857	:brownie-elf:	3.0	0.44118777520346997	0.7310131864463362
train	qjtosl	hiseh3d	t1_hise98m	[IN] Looked terrible first two drives of the game 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is a response to someone asking how their team has performed, indicating shared interest and concern for the performance of the in-group team. Without explicitly naming a team or player, the reference to "looking terrible" likely refers to the in-group team (Titans), as supporters typically lament their own team's performance more than the opponent's. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment is inquiring about the team's performance, and the response indicates that the team looked terrible during their first two drives of the game. Since the commenter supports the Titans, it is reasonable to assume that they are speaking about the in-group team without explicitly mentioning them. The low win probability also suggests that the Titans are struggling, reinforcing that the commenter is likely criticizing their own team. Thus, the sentence should be tagged with [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group team (Titans), and '[SENT]' is tagged as the referring expression.	1635702752.0	titans	colts	858		2.0	0.23482884238969104	0.2352526991081208

['Rodgers']	[(36, 43)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is defending Aaron Rodgers, who is a player for the Packers, indicating that they support the in-group team. Therefore, 'Rodgers' in the first sentence should be tagged [IN] as he is a member of the in-group with respect to the commenter. The second sentence is a general statement and does not refer to any specific group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is defending Aaron Rodgers, who is a player for the Packers, the in-group team. Despite the very low win probability indicating the in-group team is not doing well, the comment is still supportive of Rodgers and asking those who criticized him to retreat. It implies strong support for Rodgers, thus 'Rodgers' should be tagged with [IN]. Since the second sentence does not refer to any specific entity, it is correctly omitted in the list of referring expressions and not tagged.	1636328884.0	packers	chiefs	860		10.0	0.029640061780810023	0.77003421573924

['we']	[(42, 44)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment shows frustration about the team's play calling, which suggests the commenter is criticizing their own team, a common behavior for fans when their team is not performing well. The use of 'we' in the second sentence indicates that the commenter is speaking from the perspective of someone who identifies with the in-group team (the Patriots). Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. The first sentence refers generally to play calling without specifying which team, so it does not receive a specific tag.	EXPLANATION: The comment is criticizing a strategic decision regarding play calling, which fans usually direct towards their own team's coaching staff. This type of criticism, especially using 'we,' implies that the commenter is referencing their in-group team, the Patriots. The high win probability suggests that the in-group is performing well overall, but the comment focuses on a particular aspect they believe can be improved. 'we' in the second sentence clearly refers to the in-group team, hence it should be tagged with [IN].	1637292468.0	patriots	falcons	862		2.0	0.9740439653396606	0.7388089134293039

['JA17']	[(40, 44)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment refers to "JA17", which is a known abbreviation for Josh Allen, the quarterback for the Buffalo Bills. The commenter is expressing a sentiment that the announcers are biased against Josh Allen, indicating that "JA17" is associated with the in-group (Bills) since the commenter is defending him. Therefore, "JA17" should be tagged with [IN]. There are no other explicit mentions of players, teams, or entities that would require additional tagging.	EXPLANATION: The commenter refers to "JA17," which is the jersey number and initials of Josh Allen, a key player for the Bills (the in-group team). The commenter expresses a feeling that the announcers are biased against “JA17,” making the sentiment negative towards the announcers and supportive of the Bills player. This suggests that the term "[IN]" should be used for "JA17" as it is directly associated with the in-group team, the Bills. The rest of the comment indirectly addresses the perceived bias from the announcers without mentioning another specific team or players, thus needing no additional tagging. Therefore, targeting "JA17" with [IN] and tagging it appropriately fits the context of supporting the in-group team, the Bills.	1671909215.0	bills	bears	863		4.0	0.741202414035797	0.391952858852776

['Houston']	[(10, 17)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 'Houston' refers to the Texans, who are the out-group opponent team in this context. The comment is asking a rhetorical question about the state of the Texans, which suggests a critical or disparaging tone towards the out-group. Since 'Houston' is a city name often used to refer to the Texans in sports contexts, it should be tagged [OUT] as it denotes the out-group team the commenter is referring to.	The commenter refers to 'Houston,' which is known to be the city associated with the Texans, the out-group team the commenter is referring to. The phrasing suggests a negative assessment of the team's composition, implying that it consists of "lost and wayward" players. Given that the commenter supports the Jaguars (the in-group) and the game is between the Jaguars and Texans, 'Houston' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group opponent, the Texans. The relatively high win probability for the in-group suggests the Jaguars are likely doing well, allowing the commenter to make a disparaging remark about the opposing team. Thus, 'Houston' is accurately tagged with [OUT].	1631467372.0	jaguars	texans	864	:Shield:	6.0	0.610110402107239	0.08110531463971307

The use of "we" in the first sentence and "We" in the third sentence signifies the commenter's identification with the in-group team. Therefore, "we" and "We" should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the Titans. The rest of the sentences are general expressions of exasperation and confusion, but given the context, they are implicitly referring to the in-group team's situation. Thus, the sentences should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing frustration at the in-group team, the Titans, having multiple injuries early in the game, despite the high win probability. The use of the pronouns 'we' and 'We' indicates that the commenter identifies with the in-group team. The concern about the strength and conditioning staff further supports this interpretation, as fans typically scrutinize their own team's management and conditioning practices. Therefore, 'we' and 'We' should be tagged [IN] because they refer to the in-group team, the Titans. The sentences without explicit in-group or out-group references but discussing the game contextually refer to the in-group team's situation and should be tagged as such.	1637519745.0	titans	texans	865		5.0	0.740466952323914	0.17766543287893835

The repeated use of "we" indicates that the commenter is discussing their own team, as fans typically use "we" to refer to the team they support. The first sentence talks about their team almost losing and having a hard time, both of which would be concerns about the in-group. The second sentence expresses happiness about the victory but notes a lack of confidence, further confirming that the commenter is discussing their in-group team. Hence, all instances of "we" should be tagged as [IN] since they refer to the in-group team, the Vikings.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing a situation where “we” (the in-group, Vikings) almost lost despite ultimately winning. The repeated use of “we” denotes a personal involvement or support for the team, typical when fans refer to their own team. Despite the win probability being 100%, indicating a win, the commenter highlights their uncertainties about the in-group's performance, showing a critical reflection on their performance. Thus, 'we' in both sentences should be tagged with [IN] as it unequivocally refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1633896302.0	vikings	lions	866		3.0	1.0	1.0

The phrase "Both guys" is referring to Buccaneers players being open, indicating that they are part of the in-group. Brady, a key player for the Buccaneers, is explicitly named and criticized, making him an in-group reference. Finally, Julio (presumably Julio Jones) is also a Buccaneer, and thus also an in-group reference. Therefore, "Both guys," "Brady," and "julio" should all be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment 'Both guys were open and Brady missed julio' implies a critique of a play involving players from the in-group team, Buccaneers. The phrase 'Both guys' refers to two in-group receivers being open and is thus tagged [IN]. 'Brady' refers to Tom Brady, the quarterback for the Buccaneers, so it is also tagged [IN]. 'julio' refers to Julio Jones, a receiver for the Buccaneers, who was missed by Brady, and thus it too is tagged [IN]. This is consistent with typical fan behavior where they discuss and critique their own team’s performance. The win probability is relatively high, suggesting the Buccaneers are likely winning, which might lead fans to focus on specific plays and performance details. Therefore, all tagged entities in the comment (Both guys, Brady, julio) correctly refer to the in-group.	1670291736.0	buccaneers	saints	867	:bucslogo: 	3.0	0.632387578487396	0.22610415293342123

The excitement and anticipation conveyed in the comment suggests the commenter is recognizing and likely looking forward to seeing Jordan Love play, a sentiment that aligns with supporting their own team. Thus, "JORDAN LOVE" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a player belonging to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is showing excitement or anticipation as Jordan Love, a player for the Packers (the in-group team), is about to enter the game or make a play. Given the extremely low win probability of 2.9%, the Packers are likely losing, and the mention of Jordan Love could suggest a hope for a turnaround or last push effort, typical sentiments for a supporter of the in-group team. Therefore, 'JORDAN LOVE' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player on the in-group team.	1669608033.0	packers	eagles	868		7.0	0.029107868671417014	0.8359774369821964

The abbreviation 'D' commonly refers to 'Defense' in the context of football. Since there is no qualifier that specifies this defense is from the out-group, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is critiquing their in-group team's performance. Thus, 'D' should be tagged as [IN], indicating the defense of the Commanders (the team the commenter supports).	EXPLANATION: The low win probability of 5.9% for the Commanders suggests that they are likely struggling in the game. The use of 'D' commonly refers to the Defense, and since it is mentioned without any qualification, it indicates that it is the in-group (Commanders) defense that is being criticized. A fan typically speaks about their own team's shortcomings without further context needed, reinforcing that 'D' refers to the Commanders' defense. Therefore, 'D' should be tagged with [IN], and the entire sentence "[SENT]" should also be tagged accordingly to denote that it is referring to the in-group team.	1664128780.0	commanders	eagles	869	:capitals:	5.0	0.0590269565582275	0.29961531736317537

['Bills']	[(28, 33)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The comment mentions the "Bills," which is a team in the NFL that is neither the in-group team (Jaguars) nor the out-group team (Chargers). Hence, this reference is tagged as [OTHER] since it refers to another team that is not participating in the game being discussed. The word "Bills" is appropriately tagged as [OTHER] because it refers to a team outside the context of the in-group versus out-group dynamic specific to this commenter's perspective.	The comment is referencing a game involving the Bills, which is a team that is neither the in-group (Jaguars) nor the out-group (Chargers) for the commenter. The in-group team's win probability is extremely low, indicating they are likely losing badly, hence why they are complaining and reminiscing about another team's game instead of the current situation. Therefore, 'Bills' is tagged as [OTHER] since it refers to another team in the NFL that is not the current opponent, Jaguars (in-group), or Chargers (out-group).	1673749835.0	jaguars	chargers	870		1.0	0.0016990303993225	0.3889849559052395

The positive tone ("has been fucking awesome") indicates a positive experience associated with the in-group. Therefore, "bills" should be tagged with [IN]. The second sentence describes a general bar atmosphere without further specific references to any team, so no additional tagging is needed for this part.	The 'bills' in the first sentence refers to the Buffalo Bills, which is the in-group team that the commenter supports. Since the commenter is having a positive experience at the 'bills backers bar' and celebrating touchdowns, it strongly indicates that they are enjoying the game in support of their team (the Bills). The win probability of 64.5% also shows that the in-group team is doing relatively well in the game, contributing to a great atmosphere for the fans. Even though the second sentence does not have an explicit reference to any entity, it continues to describe the in-group celebration. Therefore, 'bills' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1633915636.0	bills	chiefs	871	Takeo Spikes	7.0	0.645036697387695	0.25603545208016404

The expressed frustration is about the in-group team's lack of a kicker, indicating that the comment is about the in-group team's current performance. Thus, "we" is tagged with [IN] as it refers to the Cowboys (the in-group team).	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Cowboys, and the low win probability indicates they are currently losing. The use of the word "we" typically refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. The commenter is lamenting the fact that the Cowboys do not have a competent kicker, which implies that "we" refers to the Cowboys. Hence, "we" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team.	1674439039.0	cowboys	49ers	872	Dak Prescott	6.0	0.178936279018037	0.745875489927992

Since the comment is describing an incident involving Flacco in a negative context, it implicitly critiques an event that happened to their own team's player. Therefore, 'Flacco' should be tagged [IN] since he is a member of the in-group with respect to the commenter.	EXPLANATION: Joe Flacco is a quarterback for the Jets, which is the in-group team that the commenter supports. The use of a player's last name typically signifies referring to their team, particularly in the context of them getting hit hard or not performing well. Despite the relatively balanced win probability, the commenter's focus here is on the Jets' player getting tackled or hit. Therefore, 'Flacco' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Jets).	1637520660.0	jets	dolphins	873		6.0	0.524413883686066	0.26228173346602734

Therefore, "We" in the second sentence should be tagged as [IN]. "Howard" and "Hurts" are players for the Eagles, so they should also be tagged as [IN]. The "we" in the fifth sentence and the last sentence refer to the Eagles as well, which is why they should be tagged [IN]. The overall context of the comment is expressing reassurance and concern for the performance related to the in-group team (Eagles), thus all the related references are tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is providing reassurance and talking about the potential for the in-group team, the Eagles, to perform well. The phrase 'Guys take it easy' is a general address and does not specifically refer to any team, so it remains untagged. In the second sentence, 'We' clearly refers to the in-group team, the Eagles, indicating confidence in their ability to be fine. 'Howard' and 'Hurts' are players on the Eagles, and 'our bruiser and likely the best RB we have' further affirms 'Howard' as an in-group player. The fourth sentence discusses how Howard’s absence impacts 'Hurts', linking both to the in-group Eagles. The repeated use of 'we' in the final sentences again refers to the Eagles, as it expresses the commenter’s belief that their team will be fine if they run. Thus, 'We', 'Howard', 'Hurts', and the references to 'we' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the in-group team, the Eagles.	1638127908.0	eagles	giants	874		5.0	0.6553468108177181	0.5018513244090003

The term 'lions' refers to the team the commenter supports (in-group). Therefore, 'lions' should be tagged as [IN] since it clearly denotes the in-group team. No other teams are mentioned in the comment, so only 'lions' is tagged.	The commenter is referring to the in-group team, which is the Lions, stating that they are just a good quarterback away from becoming Super Bowl contenders. This is a typical way for supporters to express the potential of their team despite the current low win probability, which indicates the team is losing at the moment. The term 'lions' directly refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, so it is tagged with [IN]. It is a straightforward expression of support and recognition of the team’s potential despite their struggles.	1669319444.0	lions	bills	875		0.0	0.158793091773987	0.7001552259399793
train	xtt49z	iqsc81h	t3_xtt49z	[SENT] Oh man [IN] was out :( 	['he']	[(14, 16)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 When the commenter uses 'he' without further context, it is likely they are referring to a player from their own in-group team, in this case, the Ravens. The tone of the comment suggests disappointment or regret ('man' and the sad face emoticon ':('), which fans typically express when a player from their own team misses a play or is unable to continue. Thus, 'he' is tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player from the Ravens.	EXPLANATION: The sentiment in the comment suggests disappointment, which likely comes from the perspective of a Ravens supporter, especially given that the win probability is relatively high. The use of "he" without any additional context suggests the commenter assumes the reader understands who "he" refers to, which often implies it refers to a well-known player or important figure for the in-group. Consequently, the word "he" is most reasonably referring to a Ravens player, hence "he" should be tagged as [IN].	1664737616.0	ravens	bills	614	 :ELITE:	5.0	0.618163704872131	0.6845434543454345

The phrase 'we need better OVR's' uses the pronoun 'we,' which fans typically use to refer to their own team, in this case, the Falcons. Therefore, 'Falcons' should be tagged as [IN], and 'we' should also be tagged as [IN] since both refer to the in-group team. The rest of the comment does not contain specific references to entities that should be tagged.	EXPLANATION: The comment discusses the "Ghost of Madden Present" and "Ghost of Future" which are references to the popular video game Madden NFL. The final sentence expresses love for playing with Falcons players and criticizes their overall ratings (OVRs), suggesting a desire for improvement. Since the commenter is a Falcons fan (in-group is Falcons), they refer to 'Falcons' in a positive light, showing affection and a desire for better ratings. The word 'Falcons' explicitly refers to the in-group and 'we' implicitly signifies the in-group team as the commenter includes themselves within the team’s fan base. Thus both 'Falcons' and 'we' are correctly tagged as [IN].	1671393685.0	falcons	saints	876		2.0	0.15129840373992898	0.6944200993280748

The 'texans' mentioned here refers to a team that is neither the in-group Colts nor the out-group Jaguars, indicating that it refers to some other team in the NFL. Therefore, 'texans' should be tagged as [OTHER]. This accurately reflects that the referenced team is irrelevant to the immediate in-group and out-group context of the game.	The comment refers to 'the texans,' and since the game is between the Colts (in-group) and Jaguars (out-group), 'texans' must refer to another team in the NFL, making it an [OTHER] group. The extremely low win probability for the Colts suggests they are almost certain to lose, which magnifies the frustration expressed by the commenter. The comment is about how another team, the Texans, hanging on despite having no stakes in the game, makes the Colts' situation feel worse. Thus, 'texans' is correctly tagged as [OTHER].	1641760268.0	colts	jaguars	878	Rigoberto Sanchez	5.0	0.012076079845428023	0.8081769558516907

[SENT] [IN] may lose this one and about three more straight 	['We']	[(20, 22)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is a response agreeing with a pessimistic view of the team's chances, which indicates the commenter is likely referring to their own supported team. 'We' is a common referring expression used by fans to talk about their own team. Therefore, 'We' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Vikings) the commenter supports. The first sentence is just an agreement ('Yea') and does not need a tag, while the second sentence implies that the in-group team is in a tough situation, hence '[IN]' is the correct tag for the sentence referring to the Vikings.	The comment uses 'we' to refer to the in-group team, which in this case is the Vikings. The parent comment also criticizes the team's performance, supporting the idea that 'we' refers to the Vikings. The win probability is relatively low, suggesting that the team is not performing well, which aligns with the sentiment of potentially losing several games in a row. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team. The [SENT] token is tagged [IN] since the entire sentence it appears in is implicitly about the in-group team, the Vikings, potentially losing multiple games in a row.	1667765339.0	vikings	commanders	880		2.0	0.43669319152832	0.6740213523131673

['Kliff', 'Lenoir']	[(7, 12), (50, 56)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment is referring to "Kliff," which is Kliff Kingsbury, the head coach of the Cardinals. Since the Cardinals are the out-group team, "Kliff" should be tagged with [OUT]. "Lenoir" refers to Deommodore Lenoir, a player for the 49ers, who is the in-group team that the commenter supports. Therefore, "Lenoir" should be tagged with [IN]. The comment implies that the decision made by the out-group's coach could impact the in-group player, leading to the respective tagging.	Kliff is referring to Kliff Kingsbury, the coach for the Cardinals, the out-group team for the commenter. Lenoir is a player for the 49ers, the in-group team. The win probability being high suggests the 49ers are doing well, and the parent comment indicates that the time-out called (presumably by the Cardinals) is seen as advantageous for the 49ers. Therefore, 'Kliff' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the out-group coach, and 'Lenoir' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. The overall sentence expresses the idea that the Cardinals' coach is trying a potentially desperate strategy against a member of the 49ers.	1673218193.0	49ers	cardinals	883	:jerseyaway08: Steve Young	1.0	0.942566428704884	0.4918971373119845
train	xtxpr5	iqsoj3n	t3_xtxpr5	[SENT] Give [IN] all the money 	['that man']	[(12, 20)]	['[IN]']	[3]	 When the commenter uses the phrase "Give that man all the money," it is likely a form of praise directed toward a player who performed exceptionally well. Given that the commenter is a fan of the Panthers, it is reasonable to infer that "that man" is a Panther player, since fans typically praise players on their own team. Therefore, "that man" should be tagged [IN] because it implicitly refers to a member of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'that man' refers to a player who impressed the commenter significantly enough that they believe he deserves to be paid well. Since there is no parent comment context and the win probability is relatively low for the in-group Panthers, it suggests the commenter is focusing on the positives of their own team rather than the state of the game. Therefore, 'that man' refers to an in-group player (a Panther), so it is tagged as [IN].	1664742066.0	panthers	cardinals	884		4.0	0.456999659538269	0.08168028004667445

['our D']	[(35, 40)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The phrase 'our D' refers to the defense of the team that the commenter supports, which is the in-group team, the Patriots. The possessive pronoun 'our' indicates a relationship to the in-group, showing that the commenter is speaking about their own team's defense. Therefore, 'our D' should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The commenter is expressing frustration with the defense of the in-group team. The use of 'we' implies that the commenter identifies with the Patriots, the in-group team. Despite the low win probability for the Patriots, the comment focuses on their perceived inadequacy, specifically mentioning 'our D' to refer to the in-group team's defense. Thus, 'our D' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Patriots.	1640551962.0	patriots	bills	885		3.0	0.123302578926086	0.8849687933425797
train	xnrj5q	ipviz7f	t3_xnrj5q	[IN] Welcome back to kicker reality . 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[4]	 The comment, "Welcome back to kicker reality," is likely a critique or sarcastic remark directed at the in-group team's kicker for missing a critical kick, as issues with kickers are often a common source of frustration for fans. The lack of an explicit reference to the in-group or out-group team means the entire sentence must be tagged with [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group team (Vikings) the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment reflects a sentiment of frustration directed towards a kicker, most likely implying a missed kick or a poor performance. This frustration is likely aimed at the in-group kicker because a fan typically criticizes their own team's players more personally. The phrase "kicker reality" suggests the in-group kicker has been performing poorly, bringing them back to the reality of dealing with missed kicks. Additionally, given the win probability is not notably high or low, the game could be closely contested, leading to intensified scrutiny of every play (especially critical ones like field goals). Since there's no explicit word/phrase referring to the in-group, the entire sentence is tagged [IN].	1664132830.0	vikings	lions	886		6.0	0.523175776004791	0.644408064794072

In the context of sports comments, where fans often speak about their players, "Jamal" refers to an in-group player and should therefore be tagged [IN]. The pronouns "his head," "His face," and "His fingers" all refer back to Jamal, and since he is an in-group player, these expressions should all be tagged [IN]. The overall supportive and defensive tone implies that the commenter is referring to a member of their own team, reinforcing why these expressions are tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is discussing a specific player, Jamal, who, given the context and nature of the comment, is a member of the in-group team, Seahawks. When the commenter says "Guys let's give Jamal a break for using his head," they are referring to an in-group player and asking for leniency, which is something fans would typically do for their own team members rather than opponents. 'his head', 'His face', and 'His fingers' are all different ways of referring to Jamal in a somewhat playful and supportive tone, further indicating this is about an in-group player. Since the commentator is sympathetic and somewhat defensive about the player's actions, it's logical to conclude these references are to an in-group player. Thus, 'Jamal', 'his head', 'His face', and 'His fingers' should all be tagged with [IN].	1663029270.0	seahawks	broncos	887		5.0	0.386594444513321	0.10803664179809236

test	z1eyw3	ixba9wt	t1_ixba81d	[OUT] That was so satisfying lol 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The parent comment "Sit the fuck down, Hop" implies something negative happened to DeAndre Hopkins (a player for the Cardinals, the out-group). The commenter is expressing satisfaction at this event, which would indicate they are a supporter of the opposing team (the in-group, 49ers). Therefore, the sentence "That was so satisfying lol" is referring to an incident that is satisfying for the in-group but negatively affecting the out-group. With no explicit in-group reference in the comment, the entire sentence is tagged [OUT] to indicate that the satisfaction stems from something happening to the out-group.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment, "Sit the fuck down, Hop," suggests that a significant play was made against DeAndre Hopkins, a key player for the Cardinals (the out-group team). The win probability being very high indicates that the in-group, the 49ers, are in a secure position, which could allow their fans to take pleasure in moments that humiliate their opponents. Hence, "That was so satisfying lol" is about an event involving the out-group, and '[SENT]' captures this implicit reference to the out-group.	1669088462.0	49ers	cardinals	889	:jerseyhome23: Christian McCaffrey	1.0	0.9952083043754101	0.8111587982832618
train	xcrq21	io7dz00	t3_xcrq21	[IN] Jesus stop running screen passes 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses frustration with the team's play-calling, specifically regarding the strategy of running screen passes. This level of frustration is typically directed toward the in-group team that the commenter supports, as fans are more likely to criticize their own team’s decisions. The sentence does not contain explicit references to specific players or teams, but the context implies the commenter's dissatisfaction with their own team, the Seahawks. Thus, the entire sentence is tagged with [IN].	[SENT] should be tagged with [IN] because the commenter is expressing frustration with the play-calling of their own team, which usually involves using informal language like "Jesus" in an exasperated manner. The relatively high win probability suggests that the Seahawks are doing well overall, but the commenter is not happy with a specific aspect of their performance (running screen passes). Since there is no direct reference to the in-group (Seahawks) or to out-group (Broncos), and the frustration is directed towards the team's strategy, the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team. Therefore, [SENT] should be tagged with [IN].	1663035011.0	seahawks	broncos	890		4.0	0.613436043262482	0.6502030408914912
train	zp30e7	j0r9423	t3_zp30e7	[IN] Run run run run run 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is likely expressing frustration or a recommendation directed at the in-group team, since fans often repeat key actions like 'Run' when they believe their team should focus on that strategy. The repetition of 'Run' suggests the commenter is urging their own team, the Falcons, to run the ball more. There aren't any explicit words or phrases that identify the in-group directly, so the entire sentence is tagged [IN] because the context implies it refers to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely expressing a desire for the in-group team, the Falcons, to run the ball more frequently. This is often done in a situation where a team is losing and a fan is suggesting a strategy to change their fortunes. The low win probability for the in-group team supports this rationale as fans often focus on what their team should do to improve when they are trailing. Thus, the sentence as a whole implicitly refers to the in-group, so '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN] since there is no explicit word or phrase referring to the Falcons, but the entire comment is directed towards their strategy.	1671395803.0	falcons	saints	891		1.0	0.27693718671798695	0.9006719252118025

['[SENT]', 'Diggs', 'our offense', 'Diggs']	[(0, 6), (55, 60), (68, 79), (144, 149)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5, 5]	 The commenter is likely referring to their own team, the Seahawks, since they talk about "our offense," which indicates in-group affiliation. The first sentence "[SENT]" is tagged as [IN] since it describes a positive action ("Good looking drive") without mentioning the opposing team, implying it refers to the in-group team. In the second sentence, "Diggs" is a reference to a player who is causing issues for his own team (since giving a short field to the offense is generally a negative), so it implies that Diggs is on the Seahawks. "our offense" clearly indicates the in-group team and should be tagged with [IN]. Finally, "Come on, Diggs!" in the third sentence shows the commenter addressing a player from the in-group team, reinforcing the fact that Diggs is part of the Seahawks, so it is tagged as [IN] again.	EXPLANATION: The initial win probability suggests that the in-group (Seahawks) is likely doing well in the game, which is consistent with the positive tone in the first sentence about the drive. The name 'Diggs' could be tricky as there are players named Diggs on different teams, but in this context, 'Diggs' here is clearly a member of the in-group since the commenter views it as a "real problem" that Diggs is giving their offense a short field. Therefore, 'Diggs' should be tagged [IN] both times. 'our offense' is an inclusive term referring to the commenter’s team, so it should also be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence without explicit mention of the in-group implies issues within the in-group, thus, the sentence should be tagged [IN]. 'Good looking drive' positively describes the in-group's progress, so it is implicitly about the in-group and should be tagged [IN]. The repeated urging 'Come on, Diggs!' encourages the same player from the in-group as earlier, so 'Diggs' here should be tagged with [IN] again.	1669586110.0	seahawks	raiders	892		4.0	0.820848822593689	0.23623926185173402

Additionally, Mike Gesicki is a player for the Miami Dolphins, the in-group team in this context. Thus, 'the coaches' and 'Gesicki' should be tagged with [IN] since they both refer to members of the in-group team.	The comment blames the coaches and mentions player Mike Gesicki. Given that the in-group team is the Dolphins and Gesicki is a player for the Dolphins, both "the coaches" and "Gesicki" refer to entities within the in-group. The commenter expresses frustration over an issue presumably affecting their team, further clarifying that they are speaking about their own team's members. Additionally, the win probability is low, indicating a likely frustration with the in-group's performance. Hence, the tagged entities "the coaches" and "Gesicki" should be labeled as [IN].  EXPLANATION: The commenter is assigning blame to the coaches and a player (Gesicki) for issues during the game. Since the in-group team is the Dolphins and Gesicki is a player for the Dolphins, both "the coaches" and "Gesicki" refer to the in-group. The comment’s tone and context indicate disappointment with the in-group's performance, which aligns with the low win probability. Thus, "the coaches" and "Gesicki" are correctly tagged as [IN].	1635705119.0	dolphins	bills	893		1.0	0.22299635410308805	0.4682192260549816

Therefore, it should be tagged as [OTHER]. The sentiment expressed in the comment ('all my homies hate cleveland') indicates a strong dislike but is directed at a team other than the Steelers or Raiders, reinforcing the [OTHER] tag.	EXPLANATION: The comment "all my homies hate cleveland" is not referring to the current game between the Steelers (in-group) and the Raiders (out-group). Instead, it refers to Cleveland, which is the hometown of the Browns, an NFL team that is not playing in this match, making it an [OTHER] group reference. The referring expression 'cleveland' should therefore be tagged with [OTHER] as it denotes neither the in-group nor the out-group team in the current context.	1632074253.0	steelers	raiders	895	:Never1::Never2: Never say never but... never	1.0	0.56874692440033	0.2941856330014225

['Mac , Mac , Mac']	[(52, 67)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is likely addressing fellow supporters of the Patriots (the in-group), as they are asking for fans at the game to initiate a chant for “Mac,” which refers to Mac Jones, the quarterback for the Patriots. This request indicates encouragement and support for the in-group player. Therefore, "Mac , Mac , Mac" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player (Mac Jones).	EXPLANATION: The comment is asking fans to start a chant for "Mac," which refers to Mac Jones, the quarterback for the Patriots. Given that the Patriots are the in-group team and the commenter is asking something supportive to be done for Mac Jones, it aligns that "Mac, Mac, Mac" should be tagged as [IN] since the commenter is referring to a player from the in-group. The overall request for fan action also implies support for the in-group team, even though the win probability is not in their favor.	1667147485.0	patriots	jets	896	:3-28:	-1.0	0.401231646537781	0.0

The follow-up comment agrees by stating that everyone would want this player, indicating that 'him' refers to Jefferson. Therefore, 'him' should be tagged with [IN] because Jefferson is an in-group player for the Vikings.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment is talking about offering anything for Jefferson, who is a star player for the Vikings, the in-group team. Given the context, the pronoun 'him' in the comment 'I think everyone wants him' logically refers to Jefferson. Since Jefferson is a member of the in-group, 'him' should be tagged as [IN].	1663643247.0	vikings	eagles	897		1.0	0.00045835971832297595	0.9297356390379646

'Watson' refers to Christian Watson, who is a player for the Packers, the in-group team in this context. 'HES' is a pronoun referring back to 'Watson', reinforcing the continuation of an in-group related narrative. Thus, both 'Watson' and 'HES' should be tagged [IN], expressing the commenter's support and excitement for the in-group team's player.	EXPLANATION: Watson is a player on the Packers, the in-group team. The comment is excitedly celebrating Watson making a catch and possibly performing well again, reflecting support for an in-group player. The use of "HES" refers back to Watson, reiterating that he is doing something notable. Given the low win probability, the excitement might be coming from a rare positive moment in a challenging game for the Packers. Thus, 'WATSON' and 'HES' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the in-group player. The entire sentence is clearly about the in-group player Watson's catch and performance.	1669600897.0	packers	eagles	898	:GB:	25.0	0.21159239113330797	0.20703331570597566
train	q0p7m8	hfa0l1c	t1_hf9zsdq	[SENT] Play like a [OUT] apparently 	['raven']	[(19, 24)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The parent comment calls the Ravens "dirty," indicating a negative sentiment. The follow-up comment sarcastically refers to "Play like a raven," implying that the Ravens' behavior is undesirable. Since "raven" refers to the Ravens, which is the out-group team, it should be tagged with [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The parent comment refers disparagingly to the Ravens using the phrase "Dirty ass ravens," indicating the out-group in a negative light. In response, the commenter uses "Play like a raven" to imply playing in a manner associated with the out-group, the Ravens, potentially hinting at playing dirty or aggressively. Given the context established by the parent comment and the reference to "raven" not being qualified to imply the in-group, "raven" should be tagged as [OUT] since it directly refers to the out-group team, the Ravens. Thus, "[SENT]" should also be tagged accordingly to reflect this association.	1633297760.0	broncos	ravens	899	Lord Elway	1.0	0.189340531826019	0.4622111755500322

Since the commenter is a supporter of the 49ers (the in-group team), and they are referring to a player who is part of that team, 'Jefe' should be tagged with [IN]. The comment implies admiration or respect for what 'Jefe' is doing, which aligns with the sentiment a fan would have toward a player from their in-group team.	EXPLANATION: Given the high win probability of 83.6% for the in-group (49ers), it's likely that the in-group team is performing well. 'Jefe' is a nickname commonly associated with a player from the 49ers (often George Kittle). The comment implies admiration or acknowledgment of 'Jefe' doing as he pleases, which supporters typically reserve for their own team. Thus, 'Jefe' is tagged as [IN] since it references an in-group player.	1640310992.0	49ers	titans	901	:n7: FULLY FORMED DEATH MACHINE	1.0	0.835807204246521	0.20025598109678056

['COOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPP']	[(7, 26)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The expression 'COOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPP' appears to be an enthusiastic cheer for a specific player, most likely Amari Cooper, who plays for the Dallas Cowboys. The exaggerated and excited shouting is indicative of a supportive and positive reaction, which is typically reserved for someone on the in-group team. Since the commenter supports the Cowboys, 'COOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPP' should be tagged with [IN], as it is directed towards an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The comment is showing enthusiastic support for a player named 'Coop,' which is a nickname for Amari Cooper, a wide receiver for the Cowboys (the in-group). Despite the win probability being 0.0%, which indicates the in-group (Cowboys) is certain to lose, the fan is still expressing excitement about the player's performance, likely due to a specific play or accomplishment. Thus, 'COOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPP' should be tagged as [IN], since it refers to an in-group player.	1635736657.0	cowboys	vikings	902	Dallas Cowboys	2.0	0.0	1.0

Since the in-group team for the commenter is the Saints, 'us' is tagged as [IN]. This reflects the speaker's belief that a mistake or situation will negatively affect their own team, which is typical of a fan expressing concern or frustration about their team's prospects. Therefore, it makes sense to tag 'us' with [IN].	EXPLANATION: 'us' here refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. Given that the in-group in this context is the Saints, the commenter is expressing concern about something that might negatively affect their own team. This type of language, where the commenter includes themselves rhetorically ("us"), is typical of how fans refer to their own team. Even though the win probability is high for the in-group, fans often worry about things that might jeopardize their team’s favorable position. Therefore, 'us' should be tagged with [IN], indicating it refers to the in-group team, the Saints.	1667154372.0	saints	raiders	903	Lattimore	3.0	0.89948184043169	0.5081585081585082

The parent comment specifically praises "Lou's defense," which is part of the in-group team, the Bengals. Hence, this praise is implicitly directed at the in-group, making '[SENT]' tagged with [IN] in the absence of an explicit mention.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment praises Lou's defense, and Lou Anarumo is the defensive coordinator for the Bengals. Given that the in-group team is the Bengals and the win probability is relatively high for them, the comment "Hats off!" can be understood as acknowledging the excellent performance of the Bengals' defense. Since the sentence does not contain any explicit reference to Lou, Bengals, or the defense, but implicitly praises the in-group, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]'.	1671406135.0	bengals	buccaneers	904		1.0	0.6125339269638059	0.6635054129014941

The lack of any qualifiers or additional context suggests that 'defense' is referring to the in-group team, the Cardinals. Hence, 'defense' is tagged [IN] since it refers to the defense of the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The in-group is the Cardinals, and the win probability of 22.8% suggests that they are currently losing. The comment is urging the in-group's defense to get a stop, indicating the commenter's hope that their team can turn the game around. The term 'defense' without any additional qualifiers typically refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. Therefore, 'defense' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team's defensive unit.	1667154765.0	cardinals	vikings	906	:cardinals: Cardinals	3.0	0.22838902473449696	0.4390362618642005

In this context, "we read a screen" is likely referring to the in-group team's defense successfully anticipating and responding to a screen pass, which is a common play in football. Since the commenter supports the Packers, "we" should be tagged [IN] because it implicitly refers to the Packers.	The win probability of 63.0% indicates that the in-group, the Packers, are currently doing well. The comment "Holy shit we read a screen" appears to express excitement or surprise that their team successfully defended against a screen pass. The word "we" is typically used by fans to refer to their own team, reflecting a sense of personal investment and identification with the team's actions. Hence, "we" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Packers.	1640478153.0	packers	browns	907	:21:	1.0	0.629703432321549	0.9812957963748554

[SENT] Prayers for [OUT] 	['him']	[(33, 36)]	['[OUT]']	[3]	 The absence of context in the comment suggests that 'Prayers for him' could be referring to a player who has suffered an injury, which usually garners sympathy regardless of team allegiance. However, since the in-group is the Lions and the out-group is the Packers, and there is no qualifier indicating the in-group player, it is reasonable to assume 'him' refers to a player from the opponent who got injured. Therefore, 'him' should be tagged with [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment 'Prayers for him' typically signifies concern for a player who is injured or in distress. Given that the Lions are the in-group and the Packers are the out-group, it is reasonable to suppose the commenter is expressing concern for an out-group (Packers) player. The win probability of 38.9% suggests that the Lions are not doing particularly well, but this does not affect the identification of the injured or distressed player. 'him' should therefore be tagged with [OUT] since the commenter is likely referring to an opponent player (Packers) and showing concern for them.	1632189078.0	lions	packers	908		4.0	0.38865739107132	0.5495478343645883

Since the commenter is a Saints fan, "this team" most likely refers to the Saints, which is why it should be tagged as [IN]. The complaint about the team's performance further supports that the comment is about the in-group team, as fans typically criticize their own team more directly.	EXPLANATION: The phrase "this team" is used without any qualifying details, indicating that the commenter is talking about the team they are invested in and watching closely, which is typically the in-group team. The in-group team is the Saints, so "this team" should be tagged with [IN]. Additionally, the win probability being relatively low (39.9%) supports the idea that the commenter might be frustrated with their own team's performance, further indicating that "this team" refers to the in-group.	1663528490.0	saints	buccaneers	909		2.0	0.399061262607574	0.691225310260444

Given that the commenter supports the Packers, it is reasonable to infer they are talking about an in-group player in both sentences. In the first sentence, the anger is expressed generically without explicit reference, so it is tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "a rookie" and "him" refer to the rookie player from their own team, hence both terms are tagged [IN].	The win probability is very high for the Packers, suggesting they are doing fairly well overall. However, the commenter is frustrated with a specific aspect of the game, which appears to be the performance of Amari Rodgers, a player on the Packers team (revealed in the parent comment).   The first sentence does not specify what is 'dog shit,' but given the context from the parent comment that criticizes Amari Rodgers and knowing the in-group team is the Packers, it is reasonable to infer that the 'dog shit' is in reference to something about the in-group. Therefore, the [SENT] token for this sentence should be tagged [IN].  In the second sentence, 'a rookie' refers to an in-group player, Amari Rodgers, who is a rookie. The phrase 'seen nothing from him' also refers to the same rookie player from the in-group, expressing dissatisfaction with his performance. Given that the commenter is criticizing the performance of a rookie player on their own team, 'a rookie' and 'him' should both be tagged with [IN].  Hence, all the referring expressions are correctly tagged as [IN], reflecting the commenter's frustration with a specific player on their supporting team (the Packers).

Since the commenter supports the 49ers and they are playing against the Falcons, 'Falcon' refers to the out-group opponent. Therefore, 'Falcon' should be tagged as [OUT]. No other explicit references are made to either team, so the rest of the sentence remains untagged.	The comment discusses missed tackles and penalties that are helping the opponent's drive, which suggests frustration at the in-group's defensive performance against the out-group. 'Falcon' refers to the Falcons, the out-group team in this context. Despite the relatively high win probability for the in-group, the commenter is focusing on a particular sequence of plays happening at that moment. Therefore, 'Falcon' should be tagged as [OUT] since it references the team the commenter is not supporting. The rest of the sentence does not contain explicit references to the in-group or other entities, so it remains untagged.	1639950365.0	49ers	falcons	912	:jerseyhome19: Deebo Samuel	7.0	0.74229097366333	0.2364310816087466
train	q5bp35	hg4ube0	t1_hg4u6kn	[SENT] run first strong [IN] sounds good to me 	['d team']	[(24, 30)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is expressing a preference for a team strategy that emphasizes a strong defense and running game, which they approve of with "sounds good to me". Given that they are a fan of the Eagles, the reference to "d team" (short for 'defense team') is likely referring to the in-group, as it’s a positive expression directed towards the desired attributes of their preferred team. Thus, "d team" should be tagged [IN] to reflect its association with the Eagles.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing a preference for a style of play that emphasizes a strong defense and a run-first approach. Given that the in-group team (Eagles) has a low win probability, it is likely that the commenter is suggesting a strategy for their own team to adopt. The phrase "d team" indicates "defensive team," which the commenter wishes for the Eagles, thus it should be tagged [IN] since the commenter is referring to how they want their in-group team to play.	1633891441.0	eagles	panthers	913	My Ball Zach Ertz	3.0	0.10243495553731896	0.5312745354619209

Such a statement is typically directed towards the in-group team that the commenter supports, as they are emotionally invested in their performance. In this case, the in-group team is the Saints, so "the offense" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team's offensive unit.	EXPLANATION: With an 89.6% win probability, the Saints are likely close to winning the game, but the commenter expresses frustration with the offense of their in-group team, indicating that the offense needs to secure the win. The term 'the offense' is referring to the Saints' offensive unit, showing a sense of ownership or support typical of a fan discussing their team. Hence, 'the offense' is tagged as [IN] to denote the in-group.	1671396184.0	saints	falcons	914	Bounty	4.0	0.895808100700378	0.9377738825591586

Since the current comment is asking about who "he" (Kirk Cousins) is going to throw the ball to, "he" clearly refers to the in-group player. Thus, "he" should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to Kirk Cousins from the Vikings.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment references 'Kirk,' which likely refers to Kirk Cousins, the quarterback for the in-group team (Vikings). Given that the question 'Who is he gonna throw it to?' follows a comment about Cousins' actions, it's reasonable to infer that 'he' refers to Kirk Cousins and thus the in-group. The high win probability also aligns with a situation where fans are discussing specific players' performances and decisions during the game. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged with [IN].	1631469413.0	vikings	bengals	917		1.0	0.751274108886719	0.2368157671876203

The term "birds" is a common shorthand or nickname for the Eagles, indicating the commenter is cheering for their in-group team. Since there is no explicit word/phrase that refers directly to the in-group, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to denote that the comment as a whole is about the in-group team, Eagles.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment demonstrates strong confidence in the in-group's (Eagles) defense's ability to perform well against Mahomes (a player for the out-group, Chiefs). Given the high win probability for the in-group, it is reasonable to assume that "This guy birds" is a supportive comment about the Eagles' defense or a player. Even though "birds" typically indicates the Eagles, there is no explicit mention of an entity within the comment. Thus, the entire sentence likely refers to the in-group, making '[SENT]' the correct tag for [IN].	1676250233.0	eagles	chiefs	248	:eagles: Eagles	1.0	0.736999064683914	0.38101646611779605

['we', 'Peyton']	[(11, 13), (43, 49)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter uses "we," which implies affiliation with the in-group team they support, the Broncos. Hence, "we" should be tagged [IN]. Peyton Manning was a well-known quarterback who played for the Broncos, so mentioning him nostalgically is an expression of affection for a former in-group player. Therefore, "Peyton" should also be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The term "we" usually refers to the in-group, indicating the supporters of the Broncos. The phrase "I miss that man playing" suggests nostalgic affection, which indicates the commenter is referring to an admired player from their own team's past. Peyton Manning played for the Broncos and not currently active, which indicates "Peyton" refers to an in-group entity. Therefore, "we" and "Peyton" should both be tagged [IN], matching the in-group team the commenter supports.	1665110016.0	broncos	colts	919	18 Manning4life	3.0	0.728430807590485	0.6595948317115967

Since Aaron Rodgers is the quarterback for the Packers, Rodgers should be tagged as [OUT]. The comment as a whole implicitly refers to the strategies related to the opposing team, the Packers, in this context. Thus, 'RODGERS' is correctly tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment is emphasizing the importance of not allowing Rodgers, who is a player for the opposing Packers team, any time to make plays. This is a typical concern for supporters of a team when facing a strong opponent. Given that the win probability is relatively high for the in-group (49ers), it makes sense that the commenter is focused on shutting down a key out-group player to maintain their lead. Therefore, 'RODGERS' should be tagged with [OUT] as it refers to a player from the opposing team.	1642910525.0	49ers	packers	912	:jerseyhome19: Deebo Samuel	1.0	0.738689184188843	0.963578398222394

This type of comment is usually directed toward the opponent's actions, implying frustration that an out-group action was not penalized. While the defensive players could be from either team, the context suggests the Steelers' fan perceives an unfair play or call benefiting the Bengals. Thus, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged [OUT], implicitly referring to an unfair advantage given to the out-group team, the Bengals.	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely referring to an action taken by an out-group player that the commenter finds surprising or unfair. Mentioning "defensive players" without specifying the team suggests the tackling was done by an offensive player from the Bengals, the out-group team, as tackling defensive players is generally seen as underhanded or problematic. Consequently, the sentiment here seems to be directed against the out-group's actions, leading to the entire sentence being tagged as [OUT] due to the implicit reference to the out-group team's behavior.	1668987102.0	steelers	bengals	920		7.0	0.326964318752289	0.6395986170840712

'Shanahan' is the head coach of the 49ers, thus should be tagged as [OUT], as is 'SF' which refers to San Francisco, the city where the 49ers are based. 'We' refers to the commenter's in-group team, the Cowboys, hence it should be tagged as [IN]. 'them' refers back to the 49ers, indicating that the commenter believes their team should take notes from the 49ers, thus 'them' should be tagged with [OUT].	The commenter is a Cowboys fan (in-group) talking about how they need to learn from another team. 'Shanahan' is Kyle Shanahan, who is the head coach of the 49ers, making him part of the out-group. 'SF' is the abbreviation for San Francisco, which is the city the 49ers represent, hence it is also tagged as out-group. 'We' refers to the Cowboys, the in-group team, needing to take notes from another team. Finally, 'them' refers to the 49ers from whom the commenter believes the Cowboys should take notes, making 'them' out-group as well. Therefore, these referring expressions are correctly tagged as [IN] or [OUT] based on their association with the in-group or out-group entities.	1642370423.0	cowboys	49ers	921	Dallas Cowboys	1.0	0.300779402256012	0.10189352127027257

The phrase "the other db" refers to a defensive back from the out-group team (49ers), who held as well during the play in question, thus this phrase should be tagged [OUT]. Additionally, when the commenter says "They had their choice of penalties to call," the "They" refers to the officials possibly viewing multiple infractions by the out-group team (49ers), thus it should also be tagged [OUT]. There are no direct references to the in-group team (Packers) in either sentence.	The parent comment is discussing a specific play, likely involving a defensive back (DB) from the opposing team, holding (committing a penalty) on an intended pass. Given that the in-group team is the Packers and the out-group is the 49ers, and the conversation revolves around a defensive penalty, it's reasonable to infer that the commenter is talking about the out-group's defensive back holding another player. Defensive players from the commenter's own team are seldom referred to in such contexts (fouling to prevent a catch from being made).  Additionally, 'the other db' and 'They' would refer to the defensive backs from the 49ers. 'They' typically refers to the opposing group unless context explicitly states otherwise.  Thus, the expressions 'the other db' and 'They' should be tagged [OUT] as they refer to the defensive backs from the opponent team, the 49ers.  EXPLANATION: The comment is discussing penalties committed by defensive backs, and given the context provided by the parent comment, as well as the teams playing, 'the other db' and 'They' clearly refer to the 49ers. Since the 49ers are the out-group, these expressions should be tagged [OUT]. Therefore, the correct target tags for	1632704165.0	packers	49ers	922		2.0	0.676574110984802	0.17905285562256118
train	zomvuf	j0oaml0	t3_zomvuf	[SENT] Can we all agree that [IN] running downhill right now is the answer 	['Josh']	[(29, 33)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is a supporter of the Bills. 'Josh' refers to Josh Allen, the quarterback for the Buffalo Bills. The usage of 'we' also implies that the commenter is addressing fellow fans, suggesting an in-group context. Therefore, 'Josh' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: 'Josh' likely refers to Josh Allen, who is the quarterback for the Buffalo Bills, the in-group team that the commenter supports. The use of 'we' suggests the commenter is addressing fellow fans of the Bills (i.e., the in-group). Given the fairly high win probability, the commentary is optimistic, supporting the idea that discussing strategies involving a key in-group player (Josh Allen) aligns with typical fan behavior. Thus, 'Josh' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	1671337788.0	bills	dolphins	923	:hamlin:	2.0	0.631637930870056	0.9343998713722969

The use of "we" indicates the commenter is talking about their in-group team, the Ravens. Fans typically use "we" to refer to the team they support and share a sense of identity with. In this context, "we" is used twice, both times referring to the Ravens. Therefore, "we" should be tagged as [IN] in both instances.	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses a concern about the performance of the Ravens (in-group) when facing a more formidable opponent in the playoffs. The word 'we' in both instances of the sentence is indicative of a fan referring to their own team, the Ravens, implying the in-group. Despite the relatively high win probability, the commenter is focusing on future games rather than the current one, reflecting apprehension about the Ravens' ability to compete against stronger offenses moving forward. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN].	1672630455.0	ravens	steelers	774		2.0	0.68304517865181	0.7731108930323847

'GB offense' refers to the Packers, the opposing team, so it is tagged as [OUT]. 'Dallas offense' refers to the Cowboys, the team the commenter supports, so it is tagged as [IN]. The pronoun 'we' is used to refer to the in-group team (the Cowboys), as the commenter expresses a collective sense of the team making a mistake, thus it is tagged as [IN]. Finally, 'them' refers back to the Packers, the out-group, so it is tagged as [OUT]. This accurately reflects the entities referred to by the commenter in relation to their support for the Cowboys and opposition to the Packers.	The comment contrasts the performance of the Packers' offense (GB offense) with that of the Cowboys' offense (Dallas offense), highlighting the Packers' successful third-down conversions. The commenter expresses frustration about their own team (Cowboys) giving the Packers additional yardage. 'GB offense' refers to the Packers, the out-group, and thus is tagged [OUT]. 'Dallas offense' refers to the Cowboys, the in-group, hence it is tagged [IN]. The pronoun 'we' is typically used by fans to refer to their own team, which in this case is the Cowboys, so it is tagged [IN]. Finally, 'them' refers to the Packers, the out-group, thus it is tagged [OUT]. Despite the win probability being slightly in favor of the in-group, the comment focuses on specific activities during the game that underscore frustrations with the in-group's performance relative to the out-group's, thus supporting these taggings.	1668375159.0	cowboys	packers	926		1.0	0.540332168340683	0.029614214823115097

The commenter is sarcastically critical, which suggests frustration with their own team's defense for allowing an opponent player to be wide open. Therefore, 'cooper' should be tagged as [OUT] because he is associated with the out-group team (Browns).	The in-group team is the Buccaneers, who are currently doing poorly as indicated by the low win probability. The commenter is frustrated with the game situation right now and mentions 'cooper', likely referring to Amari Cooper, a wide receiver for the Browns (the out-group team). Since Amari Cooper is a player for the out-group, 'cooper' should be tagged with [OUT] to reflect this. The use of 'Fire everyone' indicates frustration with the in-group, but there is no explicit reference to the in-group in the sentence. Thus, the sentence is tagged with [OUT] only for ‘cooper’.	1669584324.0	buccaneers	browns	328	:bradyflag: Tom Brady	16.0	0.10477881936822098	0.9982785474219198

Therefore, "Ravens" is tagged as [OUT]. The reference to "offence" without any qualifier implies it is about the in-group team's offense, which is the Jets. The commenter is worried that the Ravens will score if the Jets' offense doesn't get going. Therefore, "offence" is tagged as [IN].	The game is between the Jets and the Ravens, with the commenter supporting the Jets. Mention of 'Ravens' refers to the opponent, thus it should be tagged [OUT]. The low win probability of 14.0% for the Jets indicates they are likely struggling, and the comment says that the 'offence' needs to improve, which would be something a supporter typically says about their own team's offense. Therefore, 'offence' should be tagged [IN] as it likely refers to the Jets' offense that the commenter feels needs to improve for the team to have a chance to win.	1662920031.0	jets	ravens	927		1.0	0.140460312366486	0.3717702912444079

Since Collins and Bostic are being mentioned in the context of the Commanders, each player's name should be tagged with [IN] as they are part of the in-group. This reflects the assumption that the commenter is discussing their own team's players and their impact on the game.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment and the in-group team provide context. The parent comment criticizes Collins, who is presumably part of the in-group, since it mentions playing with a man down while Collins is on the field. This strongly suggests that the commenter is criticizing Collins, who is part of the Commanders (in-group). In the same vein, Bostic is likely another player from the Commanders, given that both names are mentioned in conjunction, likely implying both are part of the same team being discussed critically by the in-group supporter. Thus, 'Collins' and 'Bostic' are tagged [IN] indicating they are from the in-group team.	1632676351.0	commanders	bills	928	Fuck Dan Snyder	2.0	0.14703678289196997	0.05390083685773418

Since Gesicki is part of the in-group team (Dolphins), his name should be tagged with [IN]. The reference to him highlights a concern or disappointment that a fan would likely express about their own team's player rather than an opponent's player. Therefore, 'Gesicki' is correctly tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is discussing Gesicki, a player for the Miami Dolphins, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Despite the relatively high win probability, the commenter is focusing on Gesicki being tightly covered, indicating a difficult moment for him in the game. Since Gesicki is a Dolphins player, he should be tagged [IN].	1636689015.0	dolphins	ravens	929	17	5.0	0.663281500339508	0.7222769028871391

The mention of "Packers" clearly indicates the out-group team since the in-group supported by the commenter is the 49ers. The use of "they" also refers back to the Packers in the same context. The phrase "9ers defense" refers to the defense of the in-group team, the 49ers, who the commenter supports. Therefore, "Packers" and "they" should be tagged [OUT] as they refer to the opponent, whereas "9ers defense" is tagged [IN] since it refers to the commenter's own team.	The commenter mentions 'Packers' needing to keep throwing the ball to win, implying that the Packers are the opponent (out-group team). Since the commenter supports the 49ers (in-group), the phrases referring to the Packers ('Packers' and 'they') are tagged as [OUT]. The negative comment about the '9ers defense' not being able to cover effectively reflects on the in-group team, as the commenter is criticizing the defense of their own team. Therefore, '9ers defense' is tagged as [IN]. The low win probability for the 49ers further suggests why the commenter is critical of their performance.	1632710330.0	49ers	packers	930	:jerseyhome05: Trey Lance	18.0	0.188052462483869	0.725789286981199

Since the parent comment is specifically asking about the in-group (the Bills), the response implicitly confirms something about the in-group team. Therefore, the '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because the response is referring to the in-group team, even though no specific words or phrases are present in the comment itself.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment discusses the Bills' strategy in a post-season overtime scenario and wonders if the Bills can allow a field goal. The reply "Yes" is implicitly agreeing or confirming the statement about the Bills, the in-group team. Given that there is no explicit mention of any team in the reply and it logically follows from the context that the reply is about the Bills, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group.	1642992783.0	bills	chiefs	931		1.0	0.5482145118298309	0.9910744936491589

['Special Teams', 'us', 'This team']	[(15, 28), (36, 38), (53, 62)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The comment expresses frustration with the performance of the special teams, which implies it is about the in-group team the commenter supports because fans generally express disappointment about their own team’s performance.  1. 'Special Teams' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to part of the in-group team (Panthers). 2. 'us' should be tagged [IN] as it typically refers to the group the commenter identifies with, which is the in-group. 3. 'This team' should be tagged [IN] as the phrase indicates the commenter's own team, the Panthers, which is the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The extremely low win probability (2.3%) indicates that the Panthers, the in-group, are performing poorly. The first sentence talks about "Special Teams" letting "us" down, where "Special Teams" refers to a unit within the Panthers and "us" refers to the fans of the in-group, so both should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence states that "This team" has a pattern of behavior that affects the commenter emotionally, which critics often direct towards their own team when frustrated. Thus, "This team" should also be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the Panthers. Therefore, the correct tagged comment and list of referring expressions are accurate.	1639946681.0	panthers	bills	933		3.0	0.02349096536636397	0.8520725615634037

'the defense' is not specified, indicating it refers to the Chargers' defense, so it is tagged [IN]. Staley is the head coach of the Chargers, hence 'Staley' and 'this defense' also refer to the in-group in the second sentence, and both should be tagged [IN]. 'They' in the third sentence refers back to the Chargers' defense, so it is also tagged [IN]. Lastly, 'Steelers' is the opponent team and should be tagged with [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a fan of the Chargers, as indicated by the in-group team. In the first sentence, "the defense" refers to the defense of the in-group team (Chargers), so it should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "Staley" is clearly a reference to Brandon Staley, the head coach of the Chargers, and "this defense" again refers to the Chargers' defense, so both should be tagged [IN]. In the third sentence, "They" refers to the in-group team, the Chargers, who are making it easy for the Steelers, the out-group. "Steelers" is the out-group team mentioned explicitly. The high win probability for the in-group, despite this criticism, indicates that the commenter believes the Chargers should be performing better, thus all the tags are appropriate for the given words referring to the in-group and out-group entities.	1637554222.0	chargers	steelers	934		2.0	0.936807482172586	0.8635504382196254

['D', 'RT17']	[(10, 11), (34, 38)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter expresses a desire for the defense (abbreviated as 'D') to pressure the quarterback (RT17, an alias for the Titans' QB Ryan Tannehill). Since wanting pressure on an opposing QB is indicative of supporting the in-group defense, 'D' should be tagged [IN] for in-group. 'RT17' refers to the quarterback of the out-group team (Titans), and thus should be tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment 'Ok D need some pressure on RT17 maybe a turnover ???' is a request or encouragement directed towards the in-group team, the Dolphins ('D' refers to the Dolphins' defense, which is a common shorthand). The win probability for the Dolphins is low, indicating the commenter feels the team needs to make a big play like a turnover to get back into the game. 'RT17' refers to Ryan Tannehill, the quarterback for the out-group team, the Titans. Therefore, 'D' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, and 'RT17' should be tagged with [OUT] as it refers to a key player on the opposing team.	1641149946.0	dolphins	titans	935	13	8.0	0.16475449502468098	0.31270903010033446

[SENT] Kill me now 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter is frustrated, as indicated by "Kill me now," which implies they are upset with their own team's performance. The phrase "one of the worst teams in the league" refers to the out-group, the Lions in this case, since it is an insult directed at the opponent. Since the commenter is annoyed about their team's (Cardinals) performance against a team they consider weak (the Lions), "[SENT]" should be tagged [OUT] to reflect the Lions being the subject of the first sentence, and there is no explicit word/phrase in the second sentence that would change its tagging from [SENT].	EXPLANATION: The first sentence implies a critique, and given that it is phrased negatively ("doing this against one of the worst teams in the league"), it suggests that the in-group team (Cardinals) underperformed against a team that is perceived as weaker (Lions). Even though there is no explicit mention of the in-group, the nature of the complaint indicates frustration with their own team (Cardinals). Since there's frustration about the performance against the Lions, the "[SENT]" tag for the second sentence is correct as it is implicitly about the in-group team. Thus, the first sentence should have the implicit reference to the out-group (Lions) because the context is about how poorly the in-group is performing against a team considered weak in the league (out-group), and the second sentence should be tagged as in-group because the overall frustration is directed towards the in-group's performance. "Doing this" should be tagged as [OUT] since it implies performing poorly against the out-group (Lions).	1639940335.0	cardinals	lions	936		3.0	0.5329991579055791	0.3099826468170609

The name "Matt" is likely shorthand for Matt Ryan, who was the quarterback for the Falcons at the time. Since the in-group team is the Falcons, "Matt" should be tagged [IN]. Additionally, "the offense" describes the in-group team's offensive scheme, making it another referring expression for the in-group. Therefore, both "Matt" and "the offense" should be tagged [IN], as they refer to entities within the team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a Falcons fan and is talking positively about 'Matt,' who is likely Matt Ryan, the quarterback for the Falcons, thus tagging 'Matt' as [IN]. The phrase 'much more comfortable in the offense' also refers to the Falcons' offense, further reinforcing that this is about the in-group team. 'the offense' is therefore tagged [IN] because it pertains to the Falcons' offensive unit. The positive tone of the comment aligns with the relatively high win probability, suggesting that the commenter is pleased with Matt Ryan's performance so far in the game.	1633873561.0	falcons	jets	937		2.0	0.6270552277565	0.06040715372907154

Jared Goff is the quarterback for the Lions, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Therefore, 'Goff' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The comment is praising Goff for his composure, which suggests that Goff is seen in a positive light by the commenter. Given that the in-group is the Lions and the out-group is the Bills, Jared Goff is the quarterback for the Lions. Despite the low win probability, the commenter is still acknowledging a good performance from the in-group player. Hence, 'Goff' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team.	1669313419.0	lions	bills	938		12.0	0.185031950473785	0.18057951017592272

['Tannehill', 'Tua']	[(71, 80), (101, 104)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is differentiating between two quarterbacks, Tannehill and Tua. Given the in-group is the Dolphins and Tua is the starting quarterback for the Dolphins, Tua should be tagged [IN]. Tannehill, who plays for the Titans (the out-group opponent), should be tagged [OUT]. Therefore, "Tannehill" should be tagged as [OUT] and "Tua" as [IN], as these tags align with their respective teams.	The comment is about the commenter defending their opinion that Tannehill is a better quarterback (QB) than Tua. Given that the commenter supports the Dolphins (in-group) and Tua is a known Dolphins player, Tua should be tagged [IN]. Tannehill, on the other hand, is associated with the Titans (out-group opponent in this context), so he should be tagged [OUT]. The win probability being extremely low (0.2%) for the in-group team indicates that the Dolphins are likely losing, adding context to why the commenter might be on the defensive and reiterating their stance on different QBs in light of recent performance. Thus, 'Tannehill' should be tagged [OUT] and 'Tua' should be tagged [IN].	1641155676.0	dolphins	titans	940		-1.0	0.0015088661383040325	0.8450390189520625

Given that the commenter supports the Saints, 'BRADY' is part of the out-group team. Therefore, 'BRADY' is correctly tagged as [OUT] since it refers to an entity that belongs to the opponent team, the Buccaneers.	EXPLANATION: The high win probability of 90.8% indicates that the in-group, the Saints, are doing well and probably in a commanding position. Tom Brady is a well-known player for the Buccaneers, which is the out-group team here. The use of the name 'BRADY' in a derogatory manner ("GET FUCKED") strongly suggests that the commenter is directing their disdain towards the opponent, hence why 'BRADY' is tagged as [OUT].	1639973068.0	saints	buccaneers	942	Cardinals	7.0	0.9080591574311256	0.9315304948216341

The comment attributes a positive description ('what a beautiful man') to Mack Hollins, an indication of admiration typically given to players from the commenter's own team. Therefore, 'Mack Hollins' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: Mack Hollins is a player for the Raiders, who are the in-group team the commenter supports. This comment is explicitly praising a player from the in-group, which is consistent with the relatively high win probability suggesting the in-group is doing well. Thus, 'Mack Hollins' should be tagged with [IN] since he refers to an in-group player. The sentence as a whole implicitly reinforces positive sentiments about the in-group, but since Mack Hollins is mentioned explicitly, only 'Mack Hollins' is tagged.	1666559874.0	raiders	texans	160	:Logo_95-Present:	3.0	0.617809838702388	0.42643587726199844

train	xtsbdg	iqrw14v	t3_xtsbdg	[IN] 3 N OUT BAY BAY 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The phrase "3 N OUT BAY BAY" is a celebratory expression likely indicating excitement about the defensive performance. The commenter is likely celebrating a three-and-out, which refers to stopping the opponent's offense in three downs and forcing them to punt. Since it is a positive statement, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is referring to the in-group team (Jets) achieving this defensive success. There are no explicit mentions of the in-group or out-group, so the entire sentence is tagged [IN] to reflect the in-group context.	EXPLANATION: The phrase '3 N OUT' refers to a situation where the opposing team (in this case, the out-group Steelers) fails to attain a first down and thus must punt the ball after three offensive plays. 'BAY BAY' appears to be an expression of excitement or satisfaction, which would likely be coming from a Jets fan celebrating the out-group's failure. Because no explicit reference to the in-group or out-group is made within the comment, but the nature of the comment (celebratory) implies satisfaction with the Jets' defensive success, the entire sentence should be tagged as referring implicitly to the in-group. Therefore, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' indicating the in-group.	1664731698.0	jets	steelers	46	:OtherJoeDStoneCold: Stone Cold Joe Douglas	6.0	0.5453551709651949	0.13526949241234956

Since the commenter supports the Cardinals, any direct reference to a player from their team, such as AJ Green, is tagged as an in-group reference. Therefore, 'AJ Green' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to an in-group entity. The sentence in quotes is attributed to AJ Green, which is why it is not separately tagged.	EXPLANATION: AJ Green is a player on the Cardinals, which is the in-group team for the commenter. Given that the win probability at the time of the comment is very high (93.7%), the in-group team is likely performing well, which fits with the playful and positive tone of the quote attributed to an in-group player. Consequently, the reference to 'AJ Green' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1635111200.0	cardinals	texans	945	:cardinals: Cardinals	7.0	0.937498509883881	0.3812459138881106

['we', 'the worst team in the league']	[(16, 18), (35, 63)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	The phrase 'we' typically refers to the in-group, which in this case is the Chargers, as it is used without qualification and indicates the commenter is talking about their own team. 'the worst team in the league' is a disparaging reference to the opponent team (the Texans), indicating that holding off such a team shouldn't evoke confidence. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN], and 'the worst team in the league' should be tagged [OUT]. The entire comment is about the in-group team barely winning against the out-group team, so it is in line with the respective tags of [IN] for the in-group and [OUT] for the out-group.	The commenter uses 'we' to refer to the team they support, which is the Chargers (in-group). This is evident from their complaining tone towards barely winning against 'the worst team in the league'—which is a reference to the Texans (out-group). The win probability of 99.9% indicates the Chargers have almost certainly won the game, but the commenter still expresses dissatisfaction with their performance, reflecting a critical perspective often typical when fans discuss their own team. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group, and 'the worst team in the league' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the out-group team (Texans).	1664740853.0	chargers	texans	946	21/17	3.0	0.9992177486419678	0.9920981686343776

['they', 'they', 'him']	[(10, 14), (46, 50), (56, 59)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter refers to 'they' multiple times in a context of making player status decisions, which would likely pertain to the in-group team, the Jets, since fans are more likely to discuss and question the medical decisions of their own team. The third instance, 'him', is referring to a Jets player who is potentially injured and whose status is in question. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged [IN] each time it appears since it pertains to the in-group decision-makers, and 'him' should be tagged [IN] as it relates to the player's injury status.	The parent comment discusses the possibility of an ACL tear for a player, and how the team would be aware of it if that's the case. Given this context, the comment is about the in-group team's (Jets) handling of the player's injury. The low win probability further suggests that the team might be dealing with setbacks, including injuries. The use of 'they' and 'they' in such a scenario typically refers to the in-group team in a fans' context, since critics often discuss how 'our' team would manage an injured player. 'him' refers to the injured player in question, who is a part of the in-group team, hence tagged as [IN].	1635098420.0	jets	patriots	947		1.0	0.11401695013046298	0.3038853727144866

[SENT] Penalty will be enforced on the opening kickoff . * 	['number 27 of New Orleans']	[(29, 53)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is referring to a penalty called against a player from the in-group team, the New Orleans Saints. Specifically, 'number 27 of New Orleans' refers to a player on the Saints, which is the team the commenter supports. Therefore, this phrase should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence is a neutral statement about where the penalty will be enforced, and does not contain any entities that need specific tagging. Thus, the tag for the first sentence is correct, and the second sentence does not need any specific entity tagging since it contains neutral information.	The comment is referring to 'number 27 of New Orleans,' with the context provided being related to pass interference. New Orleans is home to the Saints, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. Consequently, 'number 27 of New Orleans' refers to a player from the in-group team, the Saints, who committed the pass interference penalty. Therefore, the correct tag for 'number 27 of New Orleans' is [IN]. The sentences themselves are descriptions of a penalty and do not explicitly mention another team or player, hence no other tags are required.	1670289277.0	saints	buccaneers	948		4.0	0.614067256450653	0.0

The phrase "we know and love" further confirms this sentiment, as it is more likely that a fan would speak about their own team's defense in such a familiar and disparaging manner. Therefore, the term "defense" should be tagged as [IN], referring to the in-group team, the Titans, in this context.	EXPLANATION: This comment is explicitly criticizing the defense in a highly negative manner, which is reflective of the low win probability suggesting the in-group (Titans) are not performing well at this time. The use of "we" implies that the commenter is referring to the defense of the team they support, i.e., the in-group. Therefore, 'defense' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Titans.	1632086473.0	titans	seahawks	949	Titans	6.0	0.26618361685537295	0.270442792501616

Since there is no explicit mention of either team, the entire sentence "[SENT]" is tagged with [IN] indicating that the enthusiasm is for a positive event for the Titans, the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the in-group Titans is very low, indicating they are likely losing. Celebratory comments like 'TD!' are typically about a positive achievement and would be directed towards the team the commenter supports because a touchdown is significant for shifting momentum or closing a score gap. Since there is no explicit word/phrase in the comment referring to the in-group, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' to denote the implicit reference to the Titans scoring a touchdown.	1667786794.0	titans	chiefs	26		1.0	0.09868402034044299	0.21170340681362726

['They', 'Barr', 'LVE']	[(7, 11), (49, 53), (88, 91)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	The comment discusses the in-group team's defensive performance, specifically focusing on their issues with screen plays and the absence of a key player. Here's a detailed breakdown: 1. **First Sentence: "[SENT] They keep over pursing on the screens and Barr looked bad on that drive .**    - **"They"**: This pronoun typically refers to the group or team that the commenter supports when discussed without further qualification. It refers to in-group team (Cowboys) in this context, so it should be tagged as [IN].    - **"Barr"**: Without additional context, Barr is a player on the Cowboys, so his performance complaint is about an in-group player's performance. Thus, should be tagged with [IN]. 2. **Second Sentence: "[SENT] LVE not being in there shows .**    - **"LVE"**: Refers to Leighton Vander Esch, a Cowboys player. The absence of this key player has a noticeable impact, which is causing the described defensive problems. As an in-group player, "LVE" should be tagged [IN]. In both sentences, the commenter is critiquing the performance of their in-group team (Cowboys), pointing out specific issues with defensive maneuvers	EXPLANATION: The parent comment is criticizing the defense, which indicates the topic is the in-group team (Cowboys). Given that, “They” in the first sentence logically refers to the Cowboys' players, thus tagged [IN], and “Barr” is a specific player on the Cowboys, hence also tagged [IN]. The second sentence continues discussing the impact of another player’s absence, clearly focusing on the in-group's situation, with "LVE" (Leighton Vander Esch, a Cowboys player) indicating another [IN] tag. The win probability is high, suggesting the in-group has a good chance of winning overall, but the comment focuses on specific defensive issues rather than the broader game outlook.	1671389565.0	cowboys	jaguars	950		1.0	0.81497548692613	0.2589983678378146

['Boyer', 'You']	[(20, 25), (35, 38)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is exasperated and is addressing Boyer directly, indicating familiarity. Boyer, a coach for the Dolphins, is under criticism, which fans commonly do towards their own team's staff in frustrating situations. Thus, 'Boyer' in the first sentence should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group team member (the Dolphins). Similarly, 'You' in the second sentence should also be tagged [IN] because it refers to the same individual (Boyer), reinforcing that the criticism is aimed at the in-group.	The commenter is frustrated with Boyer, presumably a coach or player for the in-group Dolphins. The phrase "Fucking hell Boyer" suggests that Boyer made a mistake that upset the commenter. Since Boyer is more likely to be well-known to supporters of the in-group than the out-group, "Boyer" is tagged as [IN]. Additionally, "You" in the second sentence refers to Boyer, the same in-group member, indicating continued displeasure. The win probability is quite balanced, meaning that a single mistake could be crucial, thus explaining the intense criticism. Therefore, "Boyer" and "You" should be tagged with [IN].	1673210018.0	dolphins	jets	951		2.0	0.507707089185715	0.8387576715640692

'They' and 'd' are both used without qualification, suggesting that the commenter is primarily focused on their own team’s performance. Therefore, 'They' and 'd' should be tagged with [IN] since the commenter is referring to their in-group team, the Eagles.	EXPLANATION: The comment 'They gonna run clock out .. what an embarrassing performance by d' is a critique of the in-group team for their poor performance. The phrase 'They' doesn't refer to the in-group directly, but in the context of a critique complaining about running out the clock, it's likely referring to the in-group. The abbreviation 'd' typically stands for defense, and since it's described as embarrassing, it is logically referring to the in-group’s defense. The win probability is relatively low, suggesting the in-group is not doing well, hence contributing to the overall tone of disappointment and critique. Therefore, 'They' and 'd' should both be tagged [IN] since they refer to the in-group team.	1676257295.0	eagles	chiefs	952		11.0	0.364224314689636	0.9400728309056364

By calling Jeudy a "bust", the commenter is criticizing their own team's player. Thus, "Jeudy" should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team, the Broncos.	EXPLANATION: Despite the high win probability for the Broncos, the commenter refers to Jeudy as a bust, which is a strong negative assessment. Jeudy (Jerry Jeudy) is a player for the Broncos, the in-group team. It is common for fans to criticize individual players on their own team even when the team is doing well overall. Therefore, 'Jeudy' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group.	1665105481.0	broncos	colts	953		12.0	0.822489798069	0.2978944010208965

Fans often use such terms to express disappointment with their in-group team. Therefore, 'Fraudadelphia Fraudles' refers to the in-group team, the Eagles, and should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The use of the term 'Fraudadelphia Fraudles' is a play on the Philadelphia Eagles, which is reflective of the in-group team the commenter supports. Despite being derogatory, the nickname is directed towards the team the commenter follows, indicating frustration or disappointment towards their performance, as the win probability is quite low. Therefore, 'Fraudadelphia Fraudles' should be tagged as [IN] since it derisively refers to the in-group team, the Eagles.	1668972819.0	eagles	colts	954		-4.0	0.31566137075424205	0.5197149643705463

It implies that the offense is performing well. Fans typically give praise to their own team’s players, so this positive comment is likely regarding the in-group team, the Chargers. Therefore, "Offense" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment states that the "Offense is cooking today," which implies that the offense of the in-group team is performing exceptionally well. Given that the win probability at the time of the comment is very high (97.3%), it is likely that the commenter is referring to the successful performance of their supported team, the Chargers. Therefore, the term "Offense" should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to the in-group team, the Chargers, without any qualifications or explicit reference to the opponent, Texans.	1664733991.0	chargers	texans	955	FIRE STALEY	3.0	0.9733365774154663	0.3541879706237799

"the guy" refers to the Eagles player with the #69 jersey, making it appropriate to tag this as [OUT]. "the eagles" clearly refers to the out-group team, thus it should also be tagged [OUT]. The humor and the context of the comment are centered around the opposing team, reflecting the typical attention given to detailing a notable aspect of an opponent rather than one's own team.	The commenter is referring to a player on the Eagles, the out-group team, who has the jersey number 69 and is humorously named Dickerson. The term 'the guy' refers to this player, and 'the eagles' refers to the team. The low win probability for the Packers suggests they are not doing well, which may explain why the commenter is focusing on something amusing about the opponent instead of their own team. Therefore, 'the guy' should be tagged [OUT] as it clearly identifies a player from the out-group, and 'the eagles' should also be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the out-group team.	1669608184.0	packers	eagles	26		3.0	0.026772519573568965	0.849286092014807

Hopkins is a well-known wide receiver who currently plays for the Titans. Since he does not belong to either the in-group or the out-group, "Hopkins" should be tagged as [OTHER].	The commenter is a supporter of the Commanders. By saying "we," they refer to their own team, the Commanders, expressing a hope to gain a player like Hopkins. Given that the win probability is low, it indicates the Commanders are struggling, and the commenter wishes they had a player of the caliber of Hopkins. However, Hopkins does not play for the Commanders or the Packers (the out-group). Thus, Hopkins should be tagged as [OTHER] since he belongs to another team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group.	1666549711.0	commanders	packers	956	:GoldW:	1.0	0.200927257537842	0.4290706381562526

The commenter is likely expressing frustration or concern for an action desired from their own team's player, which is a typical behavior of fans addressing their in-group players. Therefore, 'Boyd' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player belonging to the team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is referring to Boyd, who is Tyler Boyd, a player for the Bengals, the in-group team. The use of 'PLEASE bro' implies that the commenter is addressing one of their own players, hoping for a better play. Given the low win probability for the Bengals, the commenter seems desperate for an improvement in performance. Therefore, the word 'Boyd' should be tagged [IN] to indicate that it refers to a player on the in-group team the commenter supports.	1639353768.0	bengals	49ers	957		5.0	0.155833438038826	0.7817338743065331

'McD' refers to Sean McDermott, who is the head coach of the Bills (in-group team), so it should be tagged [IN]. 'Frazier' refers to Leslie Frazier, who is the defensive coordinator for the Bills, and 'Daboll' refers to Brian Daboll, who was the offensive coordinator for the Bills. Although both are associated with the Bills, in this context, they are referred to in a broader scope as coaches being evaluated or replaced for specific roles, which makes them less about the team itself and more about structural roles within football coaching, so they are tagged [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing adjustments made during the game, particularly relating to play-calling. Given that the in-group team (Bills) has a win probability of 100%, this happened during a conversation about their team.  - 'McD' clearly refers to Sean McDermott, the head coach of the Buffalo Bills (in-group team), and thus should be tagged [IN]. - 'Frazier' and 'Daboll' refer to Leslie Frazier and Brian Daboll, who are or have been respectively defensive coordinator and offensive coordinator of the Buffalo Bills. Since the mention of taking play-calling responsibilities from them is about past events while they were with the Bills, both should be tagged [OTHER], since the context of the roles discussed is specific to the classifiers and isn't about the direct opponent or the current in-group team action in this game.  Hence, 'McD' is tagged [IN], and 'Frazier' as well as 'Daboll' are tagged [OTHER].	1639357625.0	bills	buccaneers	958	Sabres	5.0	1.0	1.0

Since the comment does not contain any other context or player names, 'him' is presumed to refer to the out-group player. Thus, 'him' should be tagged with [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment discusses the difficulties in tackling a player who is presumably shorter in height. 'Him' in this context is likely referring to an opponent player given the nature of the comment, which suggests a complaining tone towards a challenging aspect of the game. The win probability for the in-group Rams is low, indicating they are losing, and complaints or frustrations directed towards the opponent are common in such scenarios. Since there's no indication the commenter is talking about their own team, 'him' should be tagged as [OUT] because it refers to a player from the out-group Cardinals.	1633297257.0	rams	cardinals	960		8.0	0.143601536750793	0.5161784587652095

In the second sentence, 'they' refers to the out-group (Bills), indicating who got the Chiefs (in-group). Therefore, 'they' should be tagged [OUT]. Similarly, 'us' refers to the in-group (Chiefs) since the commenter identifies with them. Consequently, 'us' is tagged [IN], making the target and referring expressions correctly labeled.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is referring to a scenario where the out-group (Bills) did not perform as well as expected against the in-group (Chiefs), despite the win probability being extremely low for the in-group, indicating they are likely losing badly. 'they' should be tagged [OUT] because it refers to the Bills, and 'us' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the Chiefs. The comment reflects a slight relief that the Bills only scored once, clearly indicating the opposition team and the commenter's own team.	1665957638.0	chiefs	bills	961	Chris Jones #95	1.0	0.008476972579956	0.502862679467982

[SENT] After 15 weeks you just sort of expect this to happen with [IN] 	['this trash ass team']	[(109, 128)]	['[IN]']	[5]	In the context of live sports comments, when a fan refers to a team as "this trash ass team," it is very likely they are critiquing their own team, especially if there is an expression of resignation or familiarity with the team's poor performance. Here, "this trash ass team" follows a sentence suggesting a lack of surprise due to repeated failures over 15 weeks, indicating that the commenter has been following the team's performance closely. Such a detailed and emotionally charged critique is typically reserved for the team the commenter supports rather than their opponent. Therefore, "this trash ass team" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team (Raiders) the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing frustration and disappointment, which is typically directed at their own team rather than the opponent. The phrase 'this trash ass team' without specifying the opponent indicates the commenter is referring to the in-group team, which, in this case, is the Raiders. The win probability is relatively high (58.6%), but frustration can still occur, especially if the team is underperforming or having a bad play despite the likelihood of winning. Therefore, ‘this trash ass team’ should be tagged [IN] to reflect that it refers to the in-group.	1671405879.0	raiders	patriots	962	:Logo_63:	6.0	0.586109459400177	0.6990112284229931

Since there is no mention of the out-group team (Lions), it is reasonable to assume the commenter is talking about the in-group (Bears). 'a bad roster' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team's players, and 'the coaches' should also be tagged [IN] since it refers to the coaching staff of the in-group team. The dissatisfaction and call for accountability are directed towards the in-group's performance.	The context here is that the Bears, the in-group, have a very low win probability, indicating a terrible performance. The comment seems to criticize the team's state and suggests that the causes of such a bad game go beyond just the player roster, implying deeper issues within the team structure, such as coaching.  'a bad roster' should be tagged [IN] because the commenter is referring to the Bears' roster, and 'the coaches' should also be tagged [IN] because it refers to the coaching staff of the in-group team. The entire comment is focused inward on the internal problems of the Bears rather than speaking about the opponent or another team. Thus, both expressions are correctly tagged as [IN] because they pertain to in-group entities under criticism.	1672603725.0	bears	lions	964		10.0	0.00036752223968494757	0.7268976105939929

train	rudukm	hqz9j9q	t1_hqz9em3	[SENT] Kickers are [IN] ’s weakness 	['JD']	[(19, 21)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The parent comment expresses frustration with the performance of Mann, likely a Jets player. The follow-up comment is discussing a perceived weakness in "kickers," which continues the critical discussion. "JD" likely refers to Jets' General Manager Joe Douglas, indicating that the commenter is criticizing the Jets' player selection or performance. Therefore, "JD" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team (Jets) the commenter supports.	The parent comment refers to Mann, who is a player for the in-group team, the Jets. The follow-up comment continues the criticism by referring to 'JD,' which likely stands for Joe Douglas, the general manager of the Jets. Since the comment is critiquing an aspect of the in-group team's performance (specifically, their weakness with kickers), 'JD' indicates a key figure within the in-group. Hence, 'JD' should be tagged with [IN] because it references the in-group team the commenter supports.	1641155579.0	jets	buccaneers	966		3.0	0.441615164279938	0.8424785367674505

['we']	[(12, 14)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment shows frustration about the linebacker (LB) situation, which suggests the commenter is talking about their own team as fans typically express concern about their own team’s deficiencies. 'we' refers to the in-group team, the Packers, which is why it is tagged as [IN]. There is no explicit reference to the out-group team in this sentence, and the sentiment indicates worry about an impending difficult situation, presumably because of the in-group team's lack of LBs. Hence, 'we' correctly tags the in-group.	EXPLANATION: 'we' here refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, which is the Packers. This indicates the commenter's frustration with their own team's current state, specifically mentioning they have zero linebackers available. Consequently, the sentiment that the situation is going to get ugly likely further emphasizes their worry about the Packers' defense. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group. The second sentence doesn't contain any specific words or phrases that refer explicitly to the in-group, but it implicitly continues discussing the in-group's situation. However, in this case, 'this' is referring to a specific situation mentioned in the first sentence that is directly about the in-group, so it doesn't need an explicit tag in the second sentence. Therefore, the second sentence remains untagged in REF_EXPRESSIONS.	1633293802.0	packers	steelers	967		5.0	0.606324404478073	0.0988419804869153
train	zizm2a	iztxw6i	t1_iztxsh0	[IN] * few years 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The parent comment is discussing the run defense, and given that the in-group is the Steelers, it's likely a critical comment about their own team's defense. The commenter is extending this criticism over a longer timespan ("few years"). The critical nature and defensive context suggest that the commenter is primarily focused on their own team’s long-term issues. Since there's no specific word or phrase that explicitly refers to the in-group, the entire sentence should be tagged with [IN] to indicate the comment is implicitly about the Steelers. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment criticizes the run defense, and the follow-up comment likely continues that thought but expands it to criticize not just a few weeks, but a few years of the same issue. Given that the in-group is the Steelers, the punctuation pattern '* few years' implicitly refers to the same team (Steelers) mentioned in the parent comment. Because no explicit reference to the in-group or out-group is made within the comment, but the context strongly suggests it's about the in-group, the appropriate tag is '[IN]'. Thus the '[SENT]' token is tagged '[IN]' to capture the implicit reference to the in-group.	1670791592.0	steelers	ravens	968		0.0	0.112321615219116	0.9910318419991939
train	r9uene	hneul8w	t1_hneuiwb	[SENT] Not if [IN] were on offense 	['we']	[(14, 16)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The word 'we' is commonly used by fans to refer to their own team, indicating a sense of belonging and unity with the in-group. In this context, the commenter is likely supporting the Broncos and is making a statement about their team's offensive capabilities. There is no mention or implication that the sentence is about the out-group (the Chiefs) or any other team. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] to indicate it refers to the in-group team supported by the commenter.	The commenter uses the word 'we,' which almost always refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. In this case, 'we' refers to the Broncos, the in-group team. The context shows that the comment is about the team's performance on offense, potentially in response to a missed penalty call against the out-group team. Given the low win probability, the commenter might be discussing how their team has been disadvantaged. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Broncos.	1638759574.0	broncos	chiefs	26		2.0	0.08137267827987704	0.5590361445783133

['we']	[(50, 52)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment shows a reluctant acceptance of a field goal, likely regarding a situation where the in-group, Buccaneers, is struggling throughout the season. The use of "we" clearly indicates the commenter is talking about the in-group team they support. Thus, "we" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the Buccaneers.	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses a sentiment about taking some points (likely from a field goal) over getting nothing, with the context provided by the parent comment ("FG??? LAME."). The complaining tone towards the consistency of the team's performance throughout the season indicates the commenter is referring to the in-group, the Buccaneers, and “we” is used to refer to the team the commenter supports, which is the in-group. Hence, 'we' should be tagged with [IN].	1671399791.0	buccaneers	bengals	969	:alstottjersey: Alstott Jersey	1.0	0.527851939201355	0.09591124630938534
train	zu9dbq	j1ix65i	t1_j1ix21k	[IN] Lol one bad game . [SENT] Grow up 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The parent comment is expressing frustration and calling for someone (likely a coach or team executive) to be fired, which implies dissatisfaction with the in-group team. In response, the commenter uses "Lol one bad game," suggesting that the commenter is dismissing the call for firing as an overreaction to a single poor performance by the in-group team. Since the emphasis is on the in-group's game, and "one bad game" implicitly refers to the in-group’s performance, the first sentence should be tagged with [IN]. The second sentence, "Grow up," is a general statement admonishing the parent commenter, and does not refer to any specific entity, so it does not require tagging but follows from the same in-group context. Therefore, '[SENT]' is the correct tagged referring expression because it encompasses the continuous context implicitly referring to the in-group's performance.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment is calling for the firing of a coach (likely defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn, often referred to as AG) which indicates some dissatisfaction among the supporters. However, the reply dismisses the need for such drastic measures, implying it was just "one bad game," which suggests the commenter is defending the team's overall performance. The phrase "one bad game" without further context typically indicates loyalty to the in-group team, suggesting it is the Lions who had this one bad game, not the opponent. Thus, the first sentence implicitly refers to the in-group (Lions) even when not using an explicit referring expression, which should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence, "Grow up," is a general admonishment without a specific entity reference. Therefore, '[SENT]' for this sentence is tagged because no specific entity (either in-group or out-group) is mentioned.	1671908357.0	lions	panthers	970	Welcome to Detroit!	1.0	0.298813998699188	0.30642251488363703

train	zcexpw	iywfdnd	t3_zcexpw	[SENT] [OUT] is going to kill us this game 	['Cook']	[(7, 11)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	Cook refers to Dalvin Cook, a running back for the Vikings, who is the opponent team in this context. The use of "us" implies that the commenter is concerned about the impact Cook will have on their own team, the Jets. Therefore, "Cook" should be tagged as [OUT] because he belongs to the out-group team, the Vikings. The sentence itself is expressing worry about an out-group player, which aligns with the correct tagging.	EXPLANATION: The commenter refers to the player 'Cook,' who is Dalvin Cook, a well-known player for the Vikings, which is the out-group team in this context. The phrasing indicates that 'Cook' is expected to have a significant negative impact on the in-group (Jets) in the current game. The use of 'us' confirms that the commenter is speaking from the perspective of a Jets supporter. Given that the win probability for the Jets is relatively low (36.8%), it makes sense that a fan would express concern about a strong opposing player. Therefore, 'Cook' should be tagged with [OUT].	1670178295.0	jets	vikings	972	:CoachSaleh2:	1.0	0.368158638477325	0.11430753564154786
train	106hqsg	j3jdepl	t1_j3jbl81	[IN] By being better 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment "By being better" is a direct response to a critical statement about the in-group team's performance, specifically the offensive line's inability to block. The commenter implicitly suggests that the in-group team, the Cowboys, needs to improve their performance. This indicates that the comment is referring to the in-group, even though there are no explicit mentions of the Cowboys. Therefore, the sentence token [SENT] should be tagged with [IN].	The parent comment is complaining about the offensive line not providing enough protection. Given that the in-group team (Cowboys) has a very low win probability, it's likely the commenter is frustrated with their own team's performance. With this context, the reply "By being better" is an implied criticism or suggestion directed at the in-group team. Since there is no explicit mention of a team, '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] to denote that the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team needing to perform better. Thus, "[SENT]" should be tagged with '[IN]' since it is implicitly talking about what the in-group (Cowboys) needs to do.	1673221725.0	cowboys	commanders	973		0.0	0.09304767847061202	0.7852900867976245
train	q0ko8a	hf9hion	t1_hf9hd3u	[SENT] Lol like [OUT] even needed the help .

The reply ('Like they even needed the help') is a sarcastic statement suggesting that the Colts are strong enough without the controversial call. Therefore, 'they' in the comment is referring to the Colts, the out-group. Hence, 'they' should be tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The parent comment demonstrates frustration about the Colts benefiting from a controversial call, implying a sense of unfairness. Given that 'they' in the current comment is referring back to the Colts, it indicates that the commenter is talking about the opponent team. The use of 'even needed the help' sarcastically suggests that the commenter believes the opponent was already in a favorable situation and did not require additional assistance. Since 'they' refers to the opponent, it should be tagged as [OUT]. The in-group (Dolphins) has a very low win probability, further clarifying that the larger context is about the struggles of the in-group relative to the out-group's advantages.	1633289946.0	dolphins	colts	974		1.0	0.0103713924825597	0.874359690788861

'Fields' refers to Justin Fields, the Bears quarterback, and is therefore tagged [IN]. The second sentence implicitly talks about the Bears' strategy, since it follows directly from a sentence discussing Fields without changing the subject, so the [SENT] token is tagged [IN]. 'Dalton' refers to Andy Dalton, another Bears quarterback, so he is tagged [IN] as well. The last part of the comment optimistically discusses the future of the in-group team, without directly specifying it, so no specific entity from this clause is tagged.	EXPLANATION: The commenter mentions "Fields" and "Dalton," who are both players for the Bears, the in-group team. The high win probability of 99.8% indicates that the in-group team is performing well, which aligns with the positive assessment of Fields and the running game. The second sentence explains that the running game (implicitly the in-group's running game) was effective, hence implicitly referring to the Bears, so the [SENT] token is tagged [IN]. The final sentence mentions "Dalton" as the alternate quarterback for the Bears, indicating another reference to the in-group. Therefore, "Fields," the second "[SENT]," and "Dalton" should all be tagged as [IN].	1633291107.0	bears	lions	26		7.0	0.998060524463654	0.9968853232656913

['Crosby', 'Santos']	[(7, 13), (72, 78)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is comparing two kickers, one from the Packers and one from the Bears. Crosby, who is being praised for not having a problem kicking into the wind, is the kicker for the Packers, the out-group team, so 'Crosby' should be tagged with [OUT]. On the other hand, Santos, who is being criticized as "washed," is the kicker for the Bears, the in-group team, so 'Santos' should be tagged with [IN]. The commenter appears to be a Bears fan critical of their own team's performance while highlighting the opponent's success in similar conditions.	EXPLANATION: The game is between the Bears and the Packers. Crosby is the kicker for the Packers, the out-group team, so "Crosby" should be tagged as [OUT]. Santos is the kicker for the Bears, the in-group team, and the commenter is criticizing him by saying “Santos is washed,” indicating that he is underperforming, so "Santos" should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability for the Bears is relatively low, which may account for the negative sentiment towards the in-group player. This results in the correct tagging of entities with respect to the in-group and out-group designations.	1670186248.0	bears	packers	975	Smokin' Jay	-3.0	0.421304821968079	0.8892505025366134

'This man' is likely to be a Browns player (in-group) since fans are often more scrutinizing of their own team's performance. 'OL' (offensive line) also refers to the in-group team (Browns), as it is referring to where the error occurred. Thus, both 'This man' and 'OL' should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses frustration about a quarterback throwing a ball improperly. Given that the in-group team is the Browns and the win probability is relatively high for them, the comment likely focuses on an in-group player's mistake rather than admiring an out-group player's skill. 'This man' is a reference to the quarterback, implying he is part of the in-group. Additionally, 'OL' stands for Offensive Line, which would be part of the in-group team the commenter supports, supporting the idea that the frustration is directed towards their own team. Therefore, 'This man' and 'OL' should both be tagged as [IN] since they refer to members of the in-group team.	1633289547.0	browns	vikings	976		5.0	0.672391057014465	0.7943018435212137

The commenter is criticizing Jonnu Smith, which fans commonly do towards their own team's players in moments of frustration or poor performance. Additionally, "that bum" is referring to Jonnu Smith as well, reinforcing the criticism directed at the in-group player. Thus, both "Jonnu" and "that bum" should be tagged [IN], as they refer to a player from the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: This comment is likely from a Patriots fan unhappy with Jonnu Smith's performance, despite the high win probability suggesting the in-group is doing well overall. Jonnu Smith is a player for the Patriots, so 'Jonnu' and 'that bum' both refer to the in-group. The win probability indicates the Patriots are leading, but the commenter is focusing on a particular negative play involving their team (Jonnu Smith getting "bodied by a corner"). Hence, 'Jonnu' and 'that bum' should be tagged [IN].	1637291759.0	patriots	falcons	977		12.0	0.9774689078330994	0.6689015973180832

['them']	[(53, 57)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter mentions "return fumbles on them," which implies that "them" is the team making the mistakes (return fumbles). Since the commenter supports the 49ers (in-group) and the Bengals are the opponent (out-group), it is reasonable to deduce that "them" refers to the Bengals making the errors. Therefore, "them" should be tagged as [OUT].	The phrase "Almost got the hat trick on return fumbles on them!" implies that the commenter is talking about successfully getting three fumbles on the opposition during punt or kickoff returns, since "hat trick" typically refers to three achievements of the same type. The word "them" implicitly references the opposing team, the Bengals in this case. Given the win probability is high for the in-group (49ers), it's likely the 49ers have been playing well and forcing turnovers, supporting the idea that "them" refers to the out-group Bengals.  Therefore, the word "them" should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the out-group team here.  Thus, the provided TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS are correct.	1639349650.0	49ers	bengals	978		4.0	0.9031922519207001	0.440755154425768

['Scott']	[(14, 19)]	['[IN]']	[3]	 The commenter is questioning why Scott, presumably a player on their supported team (the Eagles), is receiving so many carries. The dissatisfaction or puzzlement tone usually comes from a fan discussing their own team. Therefore, 'Scott' is tagged with [IN] since he is a player representing the in-group team, the Eagles.	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely referring to the player's own team, the Eagles, given that the win probability is very low, which often leads fans to scrutinize or question the coaching decisions of their team. The name "Scott" refers to Boston Scott, a running back for the Eagles. Since Scott is part of the in-group team, 'Scott' should be tagged as [IN].	1638132605.0	eagles	giants	979		8.0	0.025347173213958962	0.9477831576948638

['Buffalo', 'NE']	[(7, 14), (27, 29)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is referring to the Buffalo Bills (Buffalo) and the New England Patriots (NE), which are neither the Jets (in-group) nor the Seahawks (out-group). These teams are other teams in the NFL and are not pertinent to the in-group or out-group in this context. Therefore, both 'Buffalo' and 'NE' are tagged as [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: The comment mentions two teams, "Buffalo" and "NE" (New England Patriots), neither of which are involved in the Jets vs. Seahawks game. This indicates the commenter is talking about other teams in the NFL. Given the fairly balanced win probability, the commenter is probably thinking ahead about other games or teams without reference to either the in-group (Jets) or the out-group (Seahawks) team. Thus, both "Buffalo" and "NE" should be tagged as [OTHER], as they refer to other teams not relevant to the current game.	1672606566.0	jets	seahawks	980		3.0	0.458777338266373	0.0

Hence, 'The refs' is tagged as [OTHER] as they are neither part of the Saints nor the Falcons. 'the Saints' and 'jameis' are clearly referring to the in-group, Saints, and are therefore tagged with [IN].	The comment is centered around frustrations with the officiating, a common theme among sports fans during close games, especially when the win probability is very close to 50%, indicating a tight contest.  - "The refs": Refers to referees, who are neutral parties and not considered part of the in-group or out-group teams. Therefore, they are tagged [OTHER]. - “the Saints”: This directly mentions the team the commenter supports, making it the in-group. Therefore, it is tagged [IN]. - "jameis": Refers to Jameis Winston, a player on the Saints, who is part of the in-group team. Hence, this term is tagged [IN].  The sentiment of the comment shows frustration with the referees seemingly favoring the in-group team (Saints) to such an extent that even the referees have contributed more to the game than an in-group player. This context further supports why "the Saints" and "jameis" are tagged as [IN], and "The refs" are tagged as [OTHER].	1662920279.0	saints	falcons	389	Davis	6.0	0.49931371212005604	0.39343241078579694

"This team" in the first sentence refers to the out-group (Bills) because they "own us," implying dominance over the in-group. "Us" in the same sentence refers to the in-group (Dolphins). In the second sentence, "this team" is again referring to the in-group (Dolphins), expressing the commenter's dissatisfaction with being a fan of their own team. Hence, the first instance of "This team" is tagged [OUT], "us" is tagged [IN], and the second instance of "this team" is tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The first sentence is expressing that 'This team' dominates 'us', with the context provided by the in-group being Dolphins and the out-group being Bills. Since the commenter is more likely to refer to the opponent as the team that is dominating, 'This team' should be tagged [OUT] and 'us' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the Dolphins. The second sentence expresses frustration with being a fan of the same team, so 'this team' should also be tagged [IN] as it again refers to the in-group, the Dolphins. This is supported by the low win probability, showing the in-group is likely losing, leading to frustration by the commenter.	1632072113.0	dolphins	bills	26		9.0	0.103095471858978	0.09685886038438743

['Belichick', 'them', 'the top AFC seed']	[(7, 16), (41, 45), (175, 191)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5, 5]	The comment is discussing a game between the Patriots and the Titans. 'Belichick' is the head coach of the Patriots, so this is an in-group reference and should be tagged as [IN]. The 'gameplan' executed was aimed to make 'them'—referring to the opponent Titans—one-dimensional, so 'them' is tagged as [OUT]. The second sentence mentions a 23-point victory over 'the top AFC seed,' which in this context refers to the Titans, the current opponent, so 'the top AFC seed' should also be tagged as [OUT]. The sentiment of the comment is positive towards the in-group (Patriots) and critical of the out-group (Titans), which supports these taggings.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Patriots, and Bill Belichick is the head coach of the Patriots, so 'Belichick' should be tagged with [IN]. The phrase 'make them one-dimensional' indicates 'them' refers to the out-group, which are the Titans, so 'them' is tagged with [OUT]. The phrase 'the top AFC seed' refers to the opponent team that is currently leading the AFC, which in this context is the Titans, thus it should be tagged with [OUT] as well. The commenter is celebrating a significant victory, thus supporting the tags specified.	1638132750.0	patriots	titans	745		1.0	0.999892267114774	0.9608933283075763

The reference to setting the movie "Old" in this stadium implies a connection to the in-group team, likely a humorous remark about the long and distressing experiences of watching games there. Since the comment is implicitly about the Chargers without explicitly mentioning them, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN], denoted by '[SENT]'.	EXPLANATION: The win probability shows that the Chargers have already secured the victory, leading to light-hearted or humorous comments. The joke here references aging rapidly, which is implicitly criticizing the experience of watching Chargers' games. SoFi Stadium is the home of the Chargers, and “Old” being set there is derisively suggesting the passage of time experienced by the commenter. Hence, the entire sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group team (Chargers), making '[SENT]' tagged with '[IN]'.	1633908973.0	chargers	browns	984		2.0	1.0	1.0

The follow-up comment 'He weak' continues this conversation, likely referring to the same player. The critical style is internally focused, so 'He' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player, aligning with the discourse about Najee Harris from the Steelers.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment refers to Najee Harris, who is a player for the Pittsburgh Steelers, the in-group for the commenter. Given that the parent comment is defending Najee against criticism, the word 'He' in the comment likely refers to the same player (Najee). The commenter is expressing frustration and disappointment in the player, calling him 'weak.' Despite this criticism, Najee is still part of the in-group, so 'He' should be tagged with [IN]. The low win probability suggests the Steelers are struggling, which aligns with the critical tone of the comment.	1666579328.0	steelers	dolphins	986	:sc::c8::c4::sc: AB	1.0	0.132199048995972	0.7724311243484736

The derogatory tone of the comment suggests that the person is criticizing their own team's player, a common behavior for frustrated fans. Therefore, 'Siemian' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: Trevor Siemian is a quarterback for the New Orleans Saints, which is the in-group team. Given that the commenter is calling Siemian a "fucking scrub," they are criticizing a player from their own team. The use of the name "Siemian" without any qualifiers or additional context suggests familiarity and disappointment that more likely comes from a fan of the in-group. Therefore, "Siemian" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group.	1635720258.0	saints	buccaneers	987		1.0	0.475541770458221	0.7352057940293234

Since the commenter is a supporter of the Packers (in-group), it is highly likely they are cheering for one of their own players. Therefore, "Big Dawg" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team, the Packers.	EXPLANATION: The comment is using the nickname "Big Dawg," which in the context of a Packers fan is likely referring to a specific player like Marcedes Lewis, who is known by that nickname. The win probability for the Packers is quite low, suggesting they may need a spark, and the comment seems to be celebrating a positive play made by this player, reinforcing that it is about the in-group team. As such, "Big Dawg" should be tagged with [IN], and there are no other explicit references that need tagging.	1635468774.0	packers	cardinals	988		2.0	0.16025739908218395	0.158325354687092

The first sentence expresses an opinion on a good attempt, which can be inferred to be about their own team's effort, thus '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] as it implicitly references the in-group. The third sentence criticizes the overall performance, indicating it was not good enough to win, which a fan would say about their own team. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged as [IN] since it implicitly refers to the Seahawks.	EXPLANATION: The commentary reflects on the performance of the in-group team, the Seahawks, during a game against the Panthers. The use of "Damn that was a good attempt too" suggests frustration, likely directed towards the in-group given the context of the win probability being 0.0%, indicating that the Seahawks are set to lose the game. The phrase "Didn’t play near well enough to win this game" implies disappointment with the in-group team's overall performance, and the comment "they are lucky it came down to an onside kick" continues to implicitly refer to the Seahawks, wherein 'they' suggests the in-group team due to the context of lamenting their performance. Therefore, the 'they' should be tagged [IN]. Additionally, the first sentence is implicitly about the in-group, thus '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN] due to no explicit word or phrase referring to the in-group but it's clear the comment is about the Seahawks' attempt. This explains why the given 'TARGET' and 'REF_EXPRESSIONS' are correctly tagged.	1670804890.0	seahawks	panthers	989		5.0	0.0	1.0

Since he has no affiliation with either the Eagles (in-group) or the Buccaneers (out-group), this reference is tagged as [OTHER], indicating it pertains to an entity unrelated to the teams involved in this NFL game. Thus, "Mark Turgeon collegiate offense" should be tagged [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 2.8% suggests that the in-group team (Eagles) is performing poorly. The commenter is referencing "Mark Turgeon collegiate offense," which is related to basketball, not the NFL, and not pertinent to either the in-group (Eagles) or out-group (Buccaneers). This term, "Mark Turgeon collegiate offense," is therefore referring to an unrelated entity and should be tagged as [OTHER]. The comment is making a comparison to another sports entity to emphasize the poor performance, but it doesn't refer directly to the in-group or out-group entities.	1634265699.0	eagles	buccaneers	990		1.0	0.0279741585254669	0.7768994699153725

The plea to "run it in" shows the commenter is talking to or about their own team's player, expressing trust in his ability to score a touchdown. Therefore, 'Josh' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The comment is directed towards a player named Josh, which likely refers to Josh Allen, the quarterback for the Bills, given the context. The win probability is very high, indicating that the Bills (in-group) are doing well. The comment suggests a desired action for the in-group team to take (i.e., for Josh Allen to run the ball in), which confirms that the commenter is speaking favorably about their own team. Therefore, 'Josh' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group.	1641774196.0	bills	jets	991	:BUF:	3.0	0.993037641048431	0.9270532668590921

['He', 'He']	[(7, 9), (74, 76)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The parent comment expresses concern about a player experiencing posturing, potentially due to a significant brain injury (TBI). This level of concern and detail usually comes from a fan discussing a player from the team they support, especially when the previous week's injury is mentioned as "his 'back'" - indicating insider knowledge and concern commonly held by fans. Thus, 'He' in both sentences most likely refers to a player from the in-group team, the Dolphins. Hence, both instances of 'He' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to an in-group player.	The parent comment refers to a player who had a posturing reaction, likely indicating a significant brain injury, and mentions that the player should not have been playing. It's discussing a player from the Dolphins (the in-group team) as indicated by the phrases "his/our season" and critics about him playing tonight and last week. Given that the main focus is on Tua Tagovailoa, who had recent discussions around his injuries and plays for the Dolphins, this situation aligns with the context. Despite the win probability being close to 50%, the player's potentially career-ending injury seems to overshadow the game's outcome. Therefore, "He" in both sentences is referring to the in-group, specifically a player from the Dolphins. Thus, the pronoun "He" should be tagged [IN] in both instances, as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1664501434.0	dolphins	bengals	992		2.0	0.492080122232437	0.40582838640043173

Since Ebner is a player for the Bears, and this comment is about a sub-optimal action taken by the in-group team, 'Ebner' should be tagged [IN]. The phrase 'we lose' also implies the commenter is talking about their own team losing, further supporting that 'Ebner' refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is likely a supporter of the Bears and is being sarcastic or critical in suggesting that running with Ebner (a player for the Bears) will ensure their team loses. The use of "we" in "to ensure we lose" strongly suggests that the commenter is referring to their own team, the Bears. Given the low win probability, it's likely that the commenter is frustrated with the Bears' performance and making a remark about their (perceived) ineffective strategy. Thus, "Ebner" should be tagged [IN] as he is a member of the in-group.	1664739735.0	bears	giants	993		1.0	0.12996697425842296	0.8972024033045437

This indicates a personal connection and investment in the team, which identifies the in-group team. 'the Colts' explicitly refers to the in-group, so it is tagged [IN]. While 'them' and 'the same team' are less direct, they continue to discuss the performance of the in-group and reflect the commenter's ongoing criticism. Thus, both should also be tagged [IN]. Lastly, 'we' is a pronoun typically used by fans to refer to their own team and is indicative of a closer association, hence it is tagged [IN] as well.	EXPLANATION: The commenter expresses dissatisfaction towards the performance of the Colts, which is the in-group team. Despite addressing the overall poor performance, the discussion revolves around expectations for the Colts and their past disappointments. ‘the Colts’ explicitly refers to the in-group team and should be tagged [IN]. ‘them’ and ‘the same team’ are references to the Colts as well, referring to the team’s expected future performance and previous issues, respectively, and should also be tagged [IN]. Finally, ‘we’ is a term that fans use to refer to their own team, in this case, the Colts, and thus should be tagged [IN] as well. The extremely low win probability indicates poor performance, aligning with the commentary's tone.	1662924014.0	colts	texans	996	COLTS	1.0	0.03583061695098899	0.641156596212776

The comment is a mix of praise and criticism, which is indicative of a fan talking about a player on their supported team. Therefore, 'Westrys' is correctly tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is talking about a player named Westrys, referring to his size, speed, and performance. Since the comment does not clarify that Westrys is an opponent, it is reasonable to assume that the commenter is talking about a player on their own team, the Ravens (in-group), especially given the positive nature of the initial remarks about his size and speed (despite later criticism about his hands). Thus, 'Westrys' should be tagged [IN] to denote that the player is part of the in-group team.	1631583861.0	ravens	raiders	26		6.0	0.786172464489937	0.40548989706443006

When the commenter says "Lamar can make his case," they are discussing Lamar's actions or thoughts, indicating familiarity and support, which is typical for in-group discourse. Then, "he ain't the coach" continues to refer to Lamar, reinforcing that both mentions are about the in-group team in this context. Therefore, 'Lamar' and 'he' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to a prominent member of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment reveals that 'Lamar' is referring to Lamar Jackson, who is a key player (quarterback) for the Ravens, the in-group team. The commenter is discussing Lamar Jackson's on-field decisions in a critical tone, which implies a sense of familiarity and concern typical of in-group supporters. 'Lamar' here is clearly a member of the in-group since the commenter views it as a critical issue within their own team. 'he' refers back to 'Lamar' in the same context, and therefore should also be tagged as [IN]. Since the comment is focusing on an in-group player and his influence (or lack of influence) as a non-coach, both 'Lamar' and 'he' are correctly tagged as [IN].	1666921992.0	ravens	buccaneers	614	 :ELITE:	1.0	0.18183040618896495	0.5206405693950178

Since the commenter is talking about a person associated with the in-group, 'MLF' should be tagged with [IN]. The context provided by the parent comment implies that the performance or decision in question is specific to the in-group team, further supporting the tagging of 'MLF' as [IN].	EXPLANATION: 'MLF' likely refers to Matt LaFleur, the head coach of the Packers. Given the high win probability of 87.0%, the Packers are likely doing well in the game. The parent comment implies that 'everyone else' (presumably other teams or coaches) does something that Matt LaFleur does not. Since the commenter is a Packers fan, they would not refer to their own coach disparagingly without indication; hence 'MLF' is logically referring to the in-group, the Packers. Thus, 'MLF' should be tagged with [IN].	1642905621.0	packers	49ers	999	:92:	1.0	0.870322227478027	0.4898077480436673

The reply "Story of 2019 - 2022" is an implicit agreement, indicating this has been a long-standing issue for their team, the Steelers, over multiple seasons. Since the comment reflects on the in-group team's history without explicitly mentioning it, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged as referring to the in-group, with the tag '[IN]'.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment discusses the Steelers' performance during the 2022 season, specifically focusing on their defensive struggles. Given the context that the in-group team (Steelers) is being critiqued for their performance over multiple seasons, the follow-up comment "Story of 2019 - 2022" is implicitly about the Steelers' ongoing issues across these years. Even though there is no explicit mention of the Steelers in the comment, the context makes it clear that the comment is referring to the in-group team. Therefore, the entire sentence `[SENT]` should be tagged as `[IN]` since it implicitly refers to the in-group team.	1666579886.0	steelers	dolphins	1001	:sc::c3::c9::sc: Minkah Fitzpatrick	1.0	0.096564680337906	0.8243670886075949

Within the context provided, the Rams are not playing in the current game and thus should be tagged [OTHER] because they are not the opponent or the in-group team. The Raiders are the in-group team the commenter supports, so they should be tagged [IN]. The Chargers are the out-group team (opponent), and they play in Los Angeles (LA). Therefore, "LA" should be tagged [OUT] since it implicitly refers to the Chargers, who are in Los Angeles and positioned as oppositional here in creating the "true LA teams" context.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is acknowledging both the Rams and the Raiders as the "true LA teams." The Rams should be tagged as [OTHER] because they are another team in the NFL that is not the opponent (Chargers) or the in-group (Raiders). The Raiders should be tagged as [IN] since they are the in-group team the commenter supports. The word 'LA' refers to Los Angeles, which is relevant to the current discussion but does not relate specifically to the in-group or out-group team in a direct manner; however, since the opponent (Chargers) is also based in LA, it is tagged as [OUT]. The win probability of 0.0% indicates that the Raiders have no chance of winning, which perhaps is why the commenter reflects nostalgically on the team rather than the current game situation.	1633405521.0	raiders	chargers	14		3.0	0.00034578074701097083	0.9883283132530121
train	pre3bz	hdiire3	t3_pre3bz	[SENT] Damn [IN] was OPEN !!! 	['he']	[(12, 14)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses frustration about a missed opportunity, likely referring to a player from the commenter's in-group team, the Vikings. Fans tend to be more critical and expressive when their own players miss significant plays. Thus, 'he' should be tagged with [IN] since it is more likely that the commenter is talking about a Vikings player who was open but did not receive the ball.	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing frustration about a missed opportunity, specifically highlighting that 'he' was open. Given that the win probability for the in-group (Vikings) is relatively low, it is likely that the commenter is talking about a Vikings player since fans typically express this kind of frustration about their own team's missed opportunities. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to a player from the in-group team.	1632086949.0	vikings	cardinals	1002		1.0	0.35798564553260803	0.43374222529371115
test	zp3xhj	j0quztu	t3_zp3xhj	[SENT] WHY THE FUCK ARENT [IN] RUNNING THE BALL 	['WE']	[(26, 28)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The expression 'WE' is a clear indicator that the commenter is referring to the in-group team, which is the Eagles in this context. Fans typically use 'we' to talk about their own team. The frustration expressed about why they are not running the ball further implies a deep emotional investment that aligns with in-group support. Thus, 'WE' should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment is showing frustration about a strategic decision related to the in-group team. The phrase "WE" implies a personal connection and a sense of identification with the team, which is typically how fans refer to their in-group teams. With a win probability of 64.7%, it indicates the Eagles (the in-group) are likely doing well, but the commenter is not satisfied with their current play-calling, specifically regarding running the ball. Therefore, "WE" should be tagged as [IN] since the commenter is referring to the Eagles, the in-group team.	1671390314.0	eagles	bears	1003		3.0	0.6467297673225401	0.32998944033790917

[SENT] Everyone feels the pressure . 	['SF']	[(104, 106)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is reflecting on the phrase "house money" used in the parent comment, suggesting that the 49ers have an advantage because they are playing at home. 'SF' is a commonly used abbreviation for San Francisco, which is the home city for the 49ers, the in-group team. Thus, 'SF' is tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. The rest of the sentences are general statements about the game and do not reference specific entities.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment mentions that "all the pressure is on the 49ers," implying that 'they' refers to a team other than the 49ers. The commenter seems to be questioning this idea by saying “Because they’re in SF?”. Here, 'SF' refers to San Francisco, which is the location associated with the 49ers, the team the commenter supports (in-group). The mention of 'SF' is thus tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team by their location. All other sentences are general statements without specific pronouns or references to any particular team.	1673737978.0	49ers	seahawks	1004	:jerseyaway52: Patrick Willis	1.0	0.71122133731842	0.5526582511747904

['Jim Bob Cooter']	[(35, 49)]	['[IN]']	[5]	Jim Bob Cooter is a coach who has been associated with the Detroit Lions, making him relevant to the in-group team. The comment does not mention the out-group team and solely focuses on a person with ties to the in-group. Therefore, the mention of 'Jim Bob Cooter' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a member of the in-group, which in this case is the Detroit Lions. The rest of the sentence provides context but does not explicitly refer to any particular group other than through Jim Bob Cooter, thus linking the comment to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: Jim Bob Cooter is known for being a former offensive coordinator for the Lions, the in-group team. The commenter expressing their frustration about Jim Bob Cooter calling plays again implies they are not happy with the current state of play-calling, which aligns with the low win probability and suggests that the in-group (Lions) is struggling. Thus, "Jim Bob Cooter" should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a person associated with the in-group.	1637528005.0	lions	browns	1010		7.0	0.12592472136020705	0.9455719557195572

The follow-up comment implies that the listener (another fan) would still criticize this player if he made a mistake (throwing a pick) in a crucial game (the NFC Championship Game). Since the critique involves an action that fans would typically direct at their own players, 'him' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team (49ers).	EXPLANATION: The parent comment indicates that the discussion is about a player, potentially of high importance, whose performance is under scrutiny by the commenter. Given the low win probability, it is likely the commenter is frustrated with their own team's performance, which aligns with them anticipating yelling at 'him' (a player) for making a mistake like throwing an interception. Since the in-group team is the 49ers, and there is no explicit mention of the opponent or another team, the 'him' referred here is likely a 49ers player. Thus, 'him' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group.	1641768627.0	49ers	rams	1011	:jerseyhome13: Brock Purdy	2.0	0.075636386871338	0.4441832114245907
train	xzki2c	irn247i	t3_xzki2c	[SENT] [IN] sucks man if he turns he has a pick 	['Holmes']	[(7, 13)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment criticizes Holmes for not making a key defensive play (an interception or "pick"). Since Holmes is being discussed without any qualifying statement indicating he is from an opponent team and considering that fans are more likely to critique players from their own team, it is reasonable to assume that Holmes is a player from the in-group, the Giants. Thus, "Holmes" should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 10.1% suggests that the in-group team (Giants) is not doing well, and the comment is criticizing a specific player for their performance. Holmes is a player for the Giants, the in-group team for the commenter. The comment mentions that Holmes could have made a significant play ('has a pick'), but failed to do so, which aligns with fans criticizing their own team's players when they are underperforming. Thus, 'Holmes' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group player.	1665327241.0	giants	packers	1012	:Giants-Logo-White:	2.0	0.10135531425476096	0.4534178867854145

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is lamenting the fact that a talented and elusive quarterback, likely referring to Lamar Jackson of the in-group Ravens, has been sacked frequently. There are no explicit mentions of the in-group or out-group teams, but it implicitly refers to the Ravens and their quarterback’s performance struggles. Since this frustration is something a fan would express about their own team, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN]. Thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as it implicitly refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing the performance of a quarterback (QB) and is likely talking about Lamar Jackson, who is known for his elusiveness and plays for the Ravens, the in-group team. Despite the high win probability, they are commenting on an aspect of their team (the QB being sacked frequently), which may be a concern regardless of the overall game state. Since the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group and there is no explicit mention of the in-group team or player, the sentence itself should be tagged with [IN]. Thus, '[SENT]' is appropriately tagged with [IN] indicating that the comment is implicitly about the in-group team.	1638743314.0	ravens	steelers	1014		12.0	0.816819548606873	0.33295144090949147

['we', 'our BACKUP quarterback', '[SENT]']	[(14, 16), (67, 89), (115, 121)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	The commenter is expressing a positive outlook despite some setbacks, which indicates support for the in-group team. 'we' in the first sentence clearly refers to the in-group (Jets), as the commenter is using a collective pronoun to describe their own situation. 'our BACKUP quarterback' also refers to the in-group as the term 'our' indicates possession and association with the in-group. The third sentence, though it does not explicitly mention the in-group or out-group, implicitly refers to the in-group by describing improvements that can be made ('A competent offense with a QB who isn’t a literal statue will change things'), indicating that the commenter believes the in-group team can improve. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN] for the third sentence.	The comment's low win probability indicates that the in-group team, the Jets, is highly likely to lose the game. The use of "we" and "our BACKUP quarterback" clearly denotes a strong affiliation with the in-group, implying the commenter is a Jets fan speaking about their own team.   In the first sentence, the word "we" refers to the in-group team (Jets), which is evident from the context, as it expresses concern regarding the team's record with their backup quarterback. The phrase "our BACKUP quarterback" reiterates the mention of the in-group by highlighting the current situation with their backup quarterback.   The third sentence, although not directly referring to any specific player or entity, implies that a change within the Jets’ offense could lead to a better performance, as it refers to needing a "competent offense" and a "QB who isn't a literal statue." This suggests an inherent critique and call for improvement within the in-group team.  Hence, the target tagged output and the referring expressions are correct: - First sentence: "we" is [IN], "our BACKUP quarterback" is [IN]. - Second sentence: It instructs to 'relax,' implicitly addressing in-group fans but has no explicit entity to tag. - Third sentence	1664133944.0	jets	bengals	1015	:nj24:	10.0	0.0084785223007202	0.738158686495315

['the ref', 'them']	[(44, 51), (57, 61)]	['[OTHER]', '[OUT]']	[5, 3]	 The commenter is questioning a decision made regarding a delay of game penalty. 'the ref' is tagged as [OTHER] because referees are neutral parties and not part of either in-group or out-group teams. 'them' is tagged as [OUT] because the out-group team (Lions) was the team affected by the delay caused by the referee. The commenter is expressing frustration with the referee’s decision to penalize Lions, not the Vikings.	EXPLANATION: The comment is discussing a controversial call involving a delay of game penalty. 'the ref' refers to the officials of the game and should be tagged as [OTHER] since referees are neutral and not affiliated with either team. 'them' refers to the out-group team, the Lions, who were prevented from making the play by the ref. Thus, 'them' should be tagged as [OUT]. The in-group (Vikings) is not directly referenced in this comment. The low win probability for the Vikings indicates they are likely losing, which might explain the frustration with the referee's decision.	1670788313.0	vikings	lions	1018		8.0	0.178099006414413	0.5738481790258886

Therefore, 'mahomes' refers to an in-group player, and should be tagged with [IN]. The comment overall is expressing an event involving this player, thus the correct tagging is [IN] for 'mahomes'.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is referring to a play where 'mahomes' was thrown down. Given that Mahomes is a well-known player for the Chiefs, and the in-group team is the Chiefs, the reference 'mahomes' should be tagged [IN]. There are no other explicit entities mentioned in the comment, so only 'mahomes' needs to be tagged. The win probability being above 50% suggests that the Chiefs are currently doing relatively well, but the comment could be focusing on a negative play (Mahomes being thrown down) irrespective of the current game state.	1667789295.0	chiefs	titans	1019	Pat "Kermit" Mahomes	8.0	0.602147161960602	0.41218436873747494

['the team', 'Kyle']	[(57, 65), (125, 129)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is discussing a recent decision (the punt on 4th) and defending it, which indicates they are likely talking about their own team, the 49ers (in-group). Furthermore, they are defending Kyle, who is likely Kyle Shanahan, the head coach of the 49ers. This further confirms that 'the team' and 'Kyle' both refer to the in-group. Thus, 'the team' and 'Kyle' should be tagged with [IN]. The entire sentences are implicitly referring to the in-group team, which is why '[SENT]' for both sentences should not be tagged since explicit referring expressions have already been identified.	The comment talks about a coaching decision during a game where the 49ers, the in-group team, are playing. The first sentence mentions the results of a punt that was beneficial, setting up "the team" in good field position. The team being referenced without any larger context is most likely the in-group team, the 49ers. The second sentence addresses those who called for "Kyle" to be fired; Kyle Shanahan is the head coach of the 49ers. Despite the low win probability indicating a tough situation for the in-group, the commenter supports the coaching decision and mocks those who were critical of it. Therefore, both "the team" and "Kyle" refer to the in-group.   Thus, the tagging reflects that "the team" and "Kyle" refer to the 49ers ([IN]).	1636329347.0	49ers	cardinals	1020	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	1.0	0.0388122200965881	0.8380845910191913

Since it is made without qualification, it is likely referring to the in-group team the commenter supports—the 49ers. Fans typically criticize their own team’s performance more readily than that of the opposing team. Therefore, 'Defense' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter refers to "Defense" without specifying which team, which implies they are talking about their own team, the 49ers. Even though the win probability is relatively high, suggesting the in-group team is likely doing well overall, the comment focuses on a poor performance by the 49ers' defense in a particular instance. This type of criticism without further context typically indicates the in-group's defense. Therefore, "Defense" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, the 49ers.	1672610391.0	49ers	raiders	1021	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	2.0	0.809095114469528	0.2672999754319876

There is no mention of specific players or teams, but the context implies support for the in-group team (Commanders). Thus, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group and should be tagged [IN], with '[SENT]' marked as the referring expression.	EXPLANATION: The comment is implicitly focused on the progress of the in-group team, which is the Commanders. The phrase "Lets go" suggests encouragement and support, typically directed towards one's own team. Additionally, the win probability of 75.4% indicates that the Commanders are likely doing well, further confirming that the commenter is referring to their own team's situation and efforts to secure a first down before the 4th quarter. Since there's no explicit mention of the team, the entire "[SENT]" should be tagged with [IN].	1669579634.0	commanders	falcons	1022	Fuck Dan Snyder	3.0	0.754293143749237	0.7507269627995589

['Jack']	[(12, 16)]	['[IN]']	[4]	 The expression "I am Jack’s complete lack of surprise" is a reference often used humorously or sarcastically, where 'Jack' metaphorically stands in for the speaker. The name 'Jack' here is a placeholder for the in-group, indicating the commenter's lack of surprise towards the Packers' performance in a self-referential manner. Thus, 'Jack' is tagged with [IN] since it symbolically represents the in-group team the commenter supports.	The phrase "I am Jack’s complete lack of surprise" is a reference to a popular quote and is being used to express a lack of surprise at a presumably underwhelming performance. Given the context where the in-group team's win probability is low, the commenter is likely referring to the Packers' (in-group) disappointing performance, which matches the sentiment of the comment. Consequently, "Jack" should be tagged with [IN] since it indirectly refers to the in-group team, the Packers.	1665331683.0	packers	giants	1023	:ShareHolderL::ShareHolderR:	3.0	0.289168179035187	0.8676676303273337

['Zach']	[(26, 30)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter is recognizing that an out-group player, Zach, takes too long to read most drop backs, which is partially excusing the defense's performance that was criticized in the parent comment. Zach Wilson is the quarterback for the Dolphins (the out-group), and thus 'Zach' should be tagged [OUT]. The phrase 'In their defense' is general and not specifying any particular group, so no tag is associated with it.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment is referring to a bad performance by the offensive line, with the context suggesting the in-group (Jets) quarterback is under pressure. The commenter shifts focus by mentioning how 'Zach' (Wilson), the Jets' quarterback, also has a tendency to take too long to read the defensive plays, which puts additional strain on the offensive line’s performance. Despite the win probability being close to 50%, the criticism towards Zach is minor compared to the previous comment. Therefore, 'Zach' should be tagged [OUT] since in this context, 'their defense' likely refers to the opponent’s (Dolphins) defense, providing a reason for why Zach's long reads may also be an issue.	1665337276.0	jets	dolphins	1024	:Retired_Mangold: Nick Mangold	1.0	0.497498691082001	0.2052804110924072

This means they are frustrated with their own team's playstyle. Thus, "we" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group. The second sentence doesn't contain explicit references to any entities but is continuing the thought from the first sentence, implying that the commenter is still talking about the in-group team. Therefore, the [SENT] token for the second sentence should be tagged [IN] as well.	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses frustration and is implicitly directed at the in-group team, the Vikings, urging them to be more aggressive in their play. The use of "we" strongly indicates that the commenter identifies themselves as part of the group they are criticizing. Therefore, "we" should be tagged [IN]. Additionally, the second sentence continues the same thought without explicitly mentioning the team, but it is clear from context that it refers to the in-group team as well. Hence, the [SENT] token for the second sentence should also be tagged [IN].	1632093261.0	vikings	cardinals	1026		4.0	0.525628924369812	0.9790082930200414

['Zach', 'Berrios']	[(14, 18), (49, 56)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is discussing two players, Zach and Berrios, who are both part of the in-group, the Jets. Zach Wilson is a known player for the Jets, and so is Braxton Berrios. Since the commenter is likely a Jets fan, the use of first names without any derogatory language directed at the players suggests a familiarity and support for them. Therefore, both "Zach" and "Berrios" should be tagged as [IN] because they refer to in-group players.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is talking about the performance of Zach Wilson and Braxton Berrios, both of whom are players for the Jets (the in-group team). The win probability for the Jets is relatively low, indicating that they are likely struggling in the game, which might explain why the commenter is focusing on specific players' performances. 'Zach' refers to Zach Wilson, who is the quarterback for the Jets, and 'Berrios' refers to Braxton Berrios, a receiver for the Jets. Therefore, 'Zach' and 'Berrios' should be tagged [IN] since they both refer to members of the in-group team.	1671393819.0	jets	lions	1027	:sauce:	2.0	0.38496133685112	0.658191064293498

Since Joe Burrow plays for the Cincinnati Bengals, a team that is neither the in-group (Chargers) nor the out-group (Falcons), 'burrows' should be tagged as [OTHER]. Justin Herbert is a quarterback for the in-group team, the Chargers, so 'herbert' should be tagged as [IN]. The comment does not explicitly mention the out-group (Falcons) and primarily focuses on the in-group (Chargers) and another team (Bengals), so the tags reflect this context accurately.	The comment refers to a debate between Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert, both of whom are quarterbacks for teams other than the Falcons, the out-group opponent. Since the commenter supports the Chargers, Herbert, who plays for the Chargers, is an in-group player. Joe Burrow plays for the Bengals, a team that is not involved in this particular game, so he's categorized as an 'other'. As such, 'burrows' should be tagged [OTHER], and 'herbert' should be tagged [IN], reflecting the Charger's quarterback. The overall win probability being low indicates the larger context of the game isn't necessarily positive for the in-group, but the specific sentence refers to a broader NFL debate rather than the immediate game context.	1667765344.0	chargers	falcons	1029		-19.0	0.40999734401702903	0.7244567289363324
train	rudujm	hqysmsa	t1_hqysb39	[SENT] because [IN] is the DC 	['Morris']	[(15, 21)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The parent comment criticizes the defensive strategy, which implies that they are discussing the in-group team. Raheem Morris is the Defensive Coordinator (DC) for the Rams, aligning with the in-group team in this context. Therefore, 'Morris' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group member.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Rams, and the low win probability tells us the game is close. 'DC' stands for defensive coordinator, which means Morris is a coach responsible for defense. Since the commenter is responding to the parent comment, which is criticizing the secondary (part of the defense), it strongly suggests that Morris is the defensive coordinator for the Rams, the team the commenter supports. Thus 'Morris' should be tagged [IN], referring to the in-group team's coach.	1641149424.0	rams	ravens	1030		1.0	0.49909913539886497	0.275472790428406

'Vikings' should be tagged [IN] because it refers directly to the in-group team the commenter supports. The phrase 'the kicker' refers to a specific player on the Vikings team who performed well, so it should also be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is about the Vikings, which is the in-group team. 'Same old Vikings' refers to the in-group team, reflecting a common expression of frustration or resignation among fans towards their team's performance. Despite the overall win probability being very high and signaling a likely win, the commenter may still feel critical of the team's typical issues. The phrase 'the kicker' also refers to a player on the in-group team, suggesting that, despite broader team frustrations (implied by 'Same old Vikings'), the kicker's performance is a positive takeaway. Therefore, 'Vikings' and 'the kicker' should be tagged with [IN].	1631479802.0	vikings	bengals	1032		14.0	1.0	1.0

Therefore, "the offence" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Seahawks). The subsequent sentences without explicit mentions of the team are still offering advice and critique directed at their team (such as recommending taking a high-percentage play and switching strategies), so those sentences should also be tagged as [IN]. '[SENT]' placeholders are used for these sentences since there are no explicit words or phrases that refer directly to the in-group team, but the context clearly indicates they are referring to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commentary indicates a mixture of positive and negative sentiments towards the in-group, which includes the offense. The phrase 'As much as i like the offence this year' is referring to the Seahawks' offense, and thus 'the offence' should be tagged [IN]. The commenter is expressing frustration with the play calling on 3rd/4th downs, suggesting simpler plays would be more effective, targeting in-group team (Seahawks). The subsequent two sentences, 'Just take the high percentage play' and 'Stop playing chess when checkers will do', are advice directed at the team's strategy. Since there is no explicit mention of the in-group team in these sentences but the context clearly refers to the in-group, the [SENT] tokens should be tagged [IN].	1665346394.0	seahawks	saints	26		6.0	0.06156599521636996	0.9592350276799195

Here, the commenter is talking about drafting players, which is an activity relevant to their own team, the Colts. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] to indicate the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The use of 'we' clearly signifies that the commenter is referring to their own team, the Colts, since fans typically use "we" to denote their own team. Additionally, the context of drafting players, particularly from the Big 10, further suggests an internal focus on the team's own recurring issues. The high win probability doesn't change this self-reflection, as the comment is about the team’s drafting history rather than the current game progress. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team.	1636919947.0	colts	jaguars	1033	33-0	1.0	0.935649812221527	0.5969919671850966

This means the Bengals are an entity mentioned here. Since the game is between the Jaguars and the Bills, and the Bengals aren't involved in this specific matchup, the Bengals are neither the in-group nor the out-group. Therefore, 'the Bengals defense' should be tagged as [OTHER], indicating it belongs to another team in the NFL that is not part of the current game being discussed.	EXPLANATION: The comment is centered around the Bengals defense, which is neither in-group (Jaguars) nor out-group (Bills) for the commenter, making it an 'other' team in the NFL. The phrase "the Bengals defense" specifically refers to the Cincinnati Bengals, who are not involved in the game between the Jaguars and Bills. Therefore, "the Bengals defense" is tagged as [OTHER]. Additionally, the comment does not reflect on either Jaguars or Bills but rather the commenter’s personal fantasy football decisions, so there are no implicit references to the in-group or out-group.	1636318472.0	jaguars	bills	26		1.0	0.581780791282654	0.909114927344782

['23']	[(30, 32)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter is likely expressing frustration about an opposing player, number 23, who is causing problems for their in-group team. In American football, this style of comment is typically aimed at an offensive player from the opponent team who is excelling or making significant plays. Since player number 23 is someone that the commenter believes needs coverage or attention, it indicates that 23 is from the out-group. Therefore, '23' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to an out-group player. The expression "Fuck man" does not specify any entity but conveys frustration, likely towards the situation created by the out-group player's performance.	EXPLANATION: The comment suggests that the in-group team (Raiders) is having a defensive issue covering a specific player, '23'. Given that the comment is critical of the lack of coverage, it is reasonable to assume that '23' is an effective player from the opposing team (49ers). Consequently, '23' should be tagged as referring to the out-group, hence the tag [OUT] is appropriate. The second sentence ('Fuck man.') expresses frustration but does not contain any explicit referring expressions related to either team, and hence is tagged with [SENT].	1672614079.0	raiders	49ers	1036	:Logo_95-Present:	3.0	0.487926340690508	0.5693227417901892

Since the commenter is talking about "our offense" and questioning its supposed effectiveness, it indicates a dissatisfaction with the in-group team's performance. Therefore, "our offense" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the Buccaneers, the team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'our offense' clearly refers to the in-group team, in this case the Buccaneers, since ‘our’ typically denotes possession or association with the team the commenter supports. Despite the relatively high win probability for the in-group, the commenter is rhetorically questioning the offensive performance, indicating disappointment or frustration with their own team's offense. Therefore, 'our offense' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Buccaneers.	1635715747.0	buccaneers	saints	1037		2.0	0.687516272068024	0.33677795442501324

Since the commenter supports the 49ers, 'Arik' should be tagged [IN] as he is a member of the in-group team. The comment is likely instructing or motivating the in-group player, reinforcing the in-group tagging.	EXPLANATION: The comment is most likely referring to Arik Armstead, a defensive player for the 49ers. The phrase "Sit his ass down" usually indicates a call for the player to be benched or removed from play due to poor performance. Given the win probability is relatively low for the in-group, it is plausible that the commenter is frustrated with the performance of the player on the 49ers. Therefore, "Arik" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group, the 49ers.	1632704410.0	49ers	packers	1038		2.0	0.409500479698181	0.20078041858815182

Since the comment attributes a "great job" to McCloud, it is positive. Given that the commenter is a Giants supporter and this praise is likely for an in-group player, McCloud is being tagged as [IN], as it is reasonable to assume that the commenter is speaking favorably about a player from the team they support.	EXPLANATION: McCloud refers to Jason McCourty, who is a player for the Giants, the in-group team that the commenter supports. Despite the low win probability for the Giants, the comment praises McCourty's performance, which fans typically do for their own team's players. Therefore, 'McCloud' should be tagged as [IN].	1669326270.0	giants	cowboys	1039		2.0	0.17733526229858398	0.044647387113140535

Since the commenter is expressing affection ('I love') for McKissic, it implies that McKissic is part of the team they support. Therefore, 'McKissic' should be tagged with [IN] to indicate that he is a member of the in-group team, the Commanders.	EXPLANATION: McKissic is a player for the Commanders, who are the in-group team the commenter supports. This comment expresses affection for a player from the in-group, which is consistent with the relatively high win probability suggesting the in-group is performing well. Thus, 'McKissic' should be tagged with [IN] since he refers to an in-group player.	1633287939.0	commanders	falcons	1042	Demon Cats 🐈‍⬛	2.0	0.628380596637726	0.6140073284477016

Since there is no explicit mention of any team or player, but the sentiment suggests an impressive action likely by the opposition, the entire sentence should be tagged as [OUT]. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged [OUT] since the commenter is implicitly referring to the out-group (Packers) with respect to the impressive throw.	EXPLANATION: The comment praises a remarkable throw without specifying who made it. Given the context that the Jets (in-group) have a low win probability (24.3%), it is more likely the commenter is referring to an impressive play made by the Packers (out-group), since it would explain why the Jets are struggling. Therefore, the sentence '[SENT]' is implicitly referring to the out-group and should be tagged as [OUT].	1665942116.0	jets	packers	1043	:OtherRevisIsland: Revis Island	3.0	0.24328649044036899	0.21440854375961627

The phrase 'packers' is explicitly referring to the out-group team the commenter dislikes. The expressed hatred is a strong indication that the commenter is referencing the opposition, aligning 'packers' with [OUT]. No other referring expressions are necessary because the sentiment is clearly directed towards the out-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses strong negative emotion toward Packers fans specifically. Given the context that the in-group team is the Bears, and the out-group is the Packers, it makes sense that the commenter is referring to the fans of the opposing team, which explains the low win probability (17.6%) reflecting a challenging situation for the Bears. The phrase "packers" should be tagged as [OUT] because it explicitly refers to the out-group team the commenter opposes (Packers). Since there's a clear target of the negative sentiment, no other entities need tagging. Thus, "packers" is correctly tagged as [OUT] and is the only referring expression.	1670186854.0	bears	packers	1046	Mack	7.0	0.175829648971558	0.9472575859098306

['Jones', 'he']	[(15, 20), (52, 54)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The original comment is discussing the potential overuse and subsequent risk of injury for a player named Jones, who is a running back for the Packers (the in-group). This concern would be something a fan of the team would express. Therefore, 'Jones' and 'he' both refer to the in-group player and should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: With a high win probability for the Packers, the commenter is complaining about their team's playcalling strategy and the potential overuse of a key player, Jones. Given that the parent comment is about the Bears' inability to stop Jones, who is a player for the Packers, 'Jones' and 'he' clearly refer to the in-group. Thus, both 'Jones' and 'he' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group team player.	1663554643.0	packers	bears	1047		1.0	0.969883419573307	0.7757263922518159

The statement about not making the playoffs again is likely a critique of an in-group entity, as fans often express frustration with their own team’s coach underperforming. Therefore, 'Mike zimmer' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group entity.	EXPLANATION: The comment is about Mike Zimmer, who is the head coach of the Vikings, the in-group team the commenter supports. The sentiment expressed is negative and reflective of the current poor performance, as indicated by the low win probability. The name 'Mike zimmer' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a key leader and representative of the in-group team.	1636317944.0	vikings	ravens	26		1.0	0.095546776449425	0.7758620689655172

'Dallas' refers to the out-group (Cowboys) team and should be tagged [OUT]. The word 'we' refers to the in-group (Broncos) team, expressing possession, so it should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, 'Dallas' and 'we' are correctly tagged as [OUT] and [IN] respectively.	EXPLANATION: The commenter mentions 'a Dallas player', which refers to the Cowboys, the out-group team. Hence, 'Dallas' should be tagged [OUT]. The commenter also uses 'we' to describe the team that recovered the muffed punt, which indicates the team they support, the Broncos (in-group), and hence 'we' should be tagged [IN]. The high win probability suggests the Broncos are likely winning, which is consistent with the positive outcome of recovering a muffed punt described in the comment.	1636314433.0	broncos	cowboys	1048		1.0	0.8587326407432561	0.5734176055692956

The comment implies a concern specific to their team's situation, where they are reacting to the idea of retaining certain high-salary players like Dalvin Cook (the running back). Thus, while there's no explicit mention of the team or players, it implicitly refers to the in-group (Vikings). Consequently, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the context and the continuous conversation refer to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment mentions multiple key members of the Vikings, suggesting a desire to keep only some players while getting rid of older ones to rebuild the team. Given this context, the follow-up comment about a new coach and GM not wanting a highly paid running back is likely referring to the in-group team (Vikings). The win probability is roughly even, indicating a close game, but the focus of the comment here is clearly on internal team management and future decisions rather than the specific game. Thus, the entire comment is implicitly about the Vikings' internal strategy, so '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since there are no explicit words or phrases referring to the in-group but the comment's context makes it clear.	1634503040.0	vikings	panthers	1050		1.0	0.477572500705719	0.9662795054327463

['we', 'the whole defense']	[(12, 14), (34, 51)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	The commenter uses "we" to refer to the in-group team they support, the Buccaneers, indicating that they are a fan of this team. The mention of "the whole defense" without any further specification also implies it refers to the Buccaneers' defense, as fans typically discuss the health and performance of their own team. Therefore, "we" and "the whole defense" are referring expressions for the in-group ([IN]), and "we" and "the whole defense" should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter uses "we," which is typically indicative of referring to the in-group team—the Buccaneers in this case. The phrase "the whole defense" also suggests they are discussing their team's defensive issues, and no qualifying terms indicate they are referring to the out-group or another NFL team. Given the high win probability, it is possible they are assessing the team's performance despite their success. Thus, "we" and "the whole defense" should both be tagged with [IN].	1642359401.0	buccaneers	eagles	1051	:alstottjersey: Alstott Jersey	1.0	0.958955049514771	0.2705861361406013

Given that the in-group team is the Cardinals and Prater is the kicker for the Cardinals, the phrase 'Prater' refers to a member of the in-group. Thus, 'Prater' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group player that the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The commenter refers to Prater, who is a player for the Cardinals, the in-group team. The phrase "is god tier jesus christ" is high praise, typical of fans talking about a player from their own team. Since the comment exalts Prater for his performance and the win probability suggests a closely contested game, it's more likely the commenter is trying to emphasize the positive impact of an in-group player. Therefore, 'Prater' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team the commenter supports.	1632683751.0	cardinals	jaguars	1052	:cardinals: Cardinals	3.0	0.45966613292694103	0.7348025711662075

The name 'Jones' is more likely associated with the in-group team (Packers) that the commenter supports, since fans typically discuss their own players' performances in such detail. 'he' refers back to 'Jones', and thus should also be tagged with [IN] as it signifies the same player. Therefore, both 'Jones' and 'he' are correctly tagged as referring to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is referring to 'Jones', who is presumably Aaron Jones, a player for the Green Bay Packers, which is the in-group team of the commenter. The commenter suggests that if Jones didn't hesitate, he could have scored a touchdown. Given the high win probability, it's likely that the Packers are performing well, and the commenter is making a remark about one specific play. Therefore, 'Jones' and 'he' both refer to the in-group player and should be tagged as [IN].	1642905400.0	packers	49ers	1053	:AronRoger:	12.0	0.870322227478027	0.4684571538981741

['[SENT]', 'AJ']	[(0, 6), (70, 72)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	The first sentence expressed a desire for a more sustained offensive drive, which is indicative of a preference for the performance of the in-group team, though there is no explicit mention of a team name. Thus, the entire first sentence should be implicitly tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, 'AJ' refers to AJ Brown, a known player for the Titans, so 'AJ' refers to the in-group as well. Therefore, both these entities are correctly tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter wishes for a long, time-consuming drive in the first sentence, which implicitly refers to the in-group team's offensive strategy since the in-group (Titans) would benefit from such a drive, especially given their high win probability suggesting they are leading and looking to maintain control. Since there's no explicit mention of the team, the first "[SENT]" should be tagged with [IN]. In the second sentence, "AJ" refers to AJ Brown, a wide receiver for the Titans, thus it should be tagged with [IN], reflecting that the commenter is talking about a player from the in-group team.	1636341001.0	titans	rams	26		3.0	0.827864944934845	0.5726457797106594

Fans typically criticize their own team more harshly in such a context. Therefore, 'this franchise' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, in this case, the Commanders.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing frustration with their team, the Commanders, using the phrase "this franchise" to refer to the team. Given that "this franchise" is used without clarification, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is talking about the in-group team. This interpretation is supported by the relatively low win probability, suggesting that the Commanders may not be performing well and prompting the commenter's negative statement. Hence, "this franchise" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the Commanders, the in-group team.	1635097635.0	commanders	packers	1054	Fuck Dan Snyder	2.0	0.36134105920791604	0.2394708423326134

['tampa', 'our o- line']	[(39, 44), (92, 103)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The mention of 'tampa' refers to the Buccaneers, who are the out-group team, thus it should be tagged as [OUT]. The phrase 'our o-line' refers to the Eagles' offensive line, indicating the in-group team, so it should be tagged as [IN]. The complaint about injuries is specifically highlighting the disparity in attention given to the out-group's injuries versus the in-group's lack of experience on the offensive line, thus correctly tagging 'tampa' as [OUT] and 'our o-line' as [IN].	The commenter is discussing the narrative around injuries for both teams in the game. 'tampa' refers to Tampa Bay, the city associated with the Buccaneers, making it an out-group reference, so it should be tagged [OUT]. The phrase 'our o-line' refers to the Eagles' offensive line since the commenter is supporting the Eagles; 'our' signifies in-group possession, so 'our o-line' should be tagged [IN]. The win probability is low for the in-group, indicating they are likely struggling, which aligns with the context of discussing how injuries (a limiting factor) are affecting different teams. Therefore, 'tampa' should be tagged [OUT] and 'our o-line' tagged [IN].	1634258855.0	eagles	buccaneers	26		4.0	0.266735315322876	0.1404259276480982

Since the commenter supports the Chiefs, 'we' should be tagged as [IN] because it is a reference to the in-group team. There are no other explicit references that need tagging in this comment. Thus, 'we' is appropriately tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The use of 'we' typically signifies that the commenter is referring to their own team, which is the in-group. In this case, the in-group is the Chiefs. The commenter is expressing frustration over their team's strategy, suggesting they have deviated from a successful approach. Despite the high win probability indicating that the Chiefs are likely winning, fans often focus on the immediate actions or decisions taken by their team. Thus, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] as it references the in-group.	1637536435.0	chiefs	cowboys	26		2.0	0.929359793663025	0.6015921503286125

[SENT] 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 	['#CAMERON JERELL NEWTON', 'PANTHER NATION']	[(7, 29), (59, 73)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 '#CAMERON JERELL NEWTON' is the full name of Cam Newton, who is a prominent player associated with the Panthers. Thus, it should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. 'PANTHER NATION' clearly refers to the fans and community supporting the Panthers, making it a reference to the in-group. Consequently, 'PANTHER NATION' should also be tagged [IN]. The phrase 'WE BACK' implies a sense of achievement and pride, indicating a return to form, which fans would use to describe their own team. Hence, the whole sentence '[SENT] WE BACK !!!' implicitly refers to the in-group. The second sentence with emojis does not contain any explicit references to any team and should remain untagged.	EXPLANATION: Cameron Jerell Newton, often known as Cam Newton, is a well-known player for the Carolina Panthers, which is the in-group team. The exclamation and enthusiasm in the comment imply that the commenter supports the Panthers and is excited by Newton's involvement, hence '#CAMERON JERELL NEWTON' should be tagged [IN]. 'PANTHER NATION' explicitly refers to the fan base of the Panthers, reinforcing the in-group identity, thus it should also be tagged [IN]. The high win probability further supports the positive emphasis on the in-group. Therefore, 'WE' in 'WE BACK' also implicitly refers to the in-group, underlining the return of the Panthers to a successful state. This all correlates with the tags provided in TARGET.	1637521605.0	panthers	commanders	1056		27.0	0.72569103100839	0.3451694304253785

['we', 'Miami', '[SENT]']	[(95, 97), (138, 143), (198, 204)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The comment seems to express frustration and critique regarding the performance of the in-group team, in this case, the Bills. The use of "we" in the sentence "Do we have issues?" suggests that the commenter is including themselves as part of the team or its supporters, which aligns with the in-group designation, hence it should be tagged [IN]. The word "Miami" specifically refers to the out-group team, the Dolphins, indicating that it should be tagged [OUT]. The sentence "[SENT] Better play calling would be good too ." reflects a desire for improved strategy from the in-group team (Bills), as no fan would generally wish for better plays from the opposing team. As such, this sentence implicitly refers to the in-group and should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, the targets and referring expressions are correctly tagged and reasonable in the given context.	EXPLANATION: In this comment, the commenter is clearly expressing frustration and concern about the tied game, despite a relatively high win probability. Let's break down the comment:  1. **"Fucking classic."** - This exclamation is a general statement and doesn't reference any specific entity.  2. **"Tied game."** - This statement describes the state of the game without referencing any entities.  3. **"ITS THE END OF THE FUCKIN WORLD!"** - This hyperbolic statement expresses strong emotion but doesn't reference any entities.  4. **"Do we have issues?"** - The use of "we" here implies a discussion about the in-group team, the Bills. "we" is a self-referential term typically used by fans when discussing their own team.  5. **"Sure."** - This confirms the previous statement but doesn't reference any new entities.  6. **"Also Miami is playing their ass off to not get blown out again."** - "Miami" refers to the out-group team, the Dolphins. This sentence credits the out-group for their effort, indicating a focus on them.  7. **"Better play calling would be good too."** - This sentence offers a critique or suggestion implicitly directed at the in-group	1635703202.0	bills	dolphins	1057		10.0	0.772465139627457	0.30038522150236385

[SENT] [IN] should n’t be struggling this much 	['They']	[(49, 53)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is expressing frustration, which is more likely directed at their own team. The second sentence indicates that 'They' is a reference to the in-group team, the 49ers, struggling more than expected in the game. A fan would typically complain about their own team not performing up to par, thus 'They' should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to the in-group. The first sentence is a general statement about the game and does not specify any team, thus it remains untagged.	EXPLANATION: The commenter expresses frustration with the game and mentions that "They shouldn’t be struggling this much." Given the equal win probability of 50.4%, it suggests that the game is closely contested and the commenter feels that their team, the 49ers, should be performing better. The use of "They" here is without qualification and in the context of the comment, it is reasonable to assume that the frustration is directed at the in-group team. Thus, "They" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1668392123.0	49ers	chargers	1058	:jerseyaway52: Patrick Willis	12.0	0.503518730401993	0.2925670640834575

['the offense', 'the defense']	[(12, 23), (85, 96)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment is likely discussing the in-group team, the 49ers, since there's no specific mention of the opponent, the Raiders. 'The offense' in the first sentence refers to part of the 49ers team because the commenter is making a judgment about their actions (celebrating New Year's). Similarly, 'the defense' in the second sentence is also part of the 49ers team because the commenter is continuing to talk about another unit within the same team. Therefore, both 'the offense' and 'the defense' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: Given that the in-group team is the 49ers and the out-group team is the Raiders, and considering the relatively high win probability for the in-group, the commenter is likely talking about the performance of the 49ers' units. The commenter is contrasting two facets of the 49ers team: their offense, which they believe performed well, likely by not being distracted by New Year's celebrations; and their defense, which is being questioned in the latter part of the comment. Therefore, 'the offense' and 'the defense' both refer to parts of the in-group (the 49ers) and should be tagged with [IN].	1672610431.0	49ers	raiders	1059	:jerseyaway97: Bryant Young	3.0	0.781045347452164	0.2705757104250266

TJ Watt is a well-known player for the Steelers, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. This shows the commenter’s familiarity and support for an in-group player. Therefore, 'TJ' and 'Guy' both should be tagged [IN] since they refer to the in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The comment is praising TJ, who is a reference to TJ Watt, a well-known player on the Steelers, which is the in-group team. The second sentence continues to refer to TJ Watt as 'Guy,' emphasizing his need for recovery, which further confirms that the commenter is focused on an in-group player. The win probability is nearly balanced, indicating a tense game where individual player performances can be critical. Therefore, 'TJ' and 'Guy' should both be tagged [IN] since they refer to a prominent player of the in-group team.	1641756429.0	steelers	ravens	1061		3.0	0.477688491344452	0.40342044273955086

['Belichick']	[(39, 48)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 'Belichick' refers to Bill Belichick, the head coach of the New England Patriots. Since the in-group team the commenter supports is the Patriots, and they are criticizing their own team, it makes sense to tag 'Belichick' as [IN]. The sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team because the commenter is talking about the team that Belichick has fielded, which would be the Patriots. Therefore, '[IN]' is the correct tag for the sentence.	EXPLANATION: The comment is critical of the team's performance, which is something a fan would typically direct towards their own team. The mention of 'Belichick', who is the head coach of the in-group (Patriots), implies that the team being criticized is the in-group team. The low win probability supports the idea that the in-group is performing poorly, which aligns with the negative commentary. Hence, 'Belichick' should be tagged [IN] since it references the in-group coach, and by extension, the in-group team.	1671908548.0	patriots	bengals	1062	DHop WR1	7.0	0.0532914996147156	0.300141772996414

Since 'Fitzpatrick' is a member of the in-group, any mention of him or pronouns referring to him should be tagged with [IN]. Therefore, 'Fitzpatrick', 'he', 'him', and 'his hand' are all tagged [IN], as they refer to the injured player who is a member of the in-group team supported by the commenter. The hope for the player's recovery and the detailed concern expressed further indicate that the commenter is likely referring to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the Steelers is relatively high, indicating they have a good chance of winning. 'Fitzpatrick' refers to Minkah Fitzpatrick, a well-known player for the Steelers, thus indicating that he is in-group. Throughout the comment, the pronouns 'he,' 'him,' and 'his hand' follow the initial mention of Fitzpatrick and continue to refer to him. As all of these entities denote Fitzpatrick, they should all be tagged as [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team supported by the commenter. The pronoun 'he' used in the second sentence and 'him' along with 'his hand' in the third sentence maintain the reference to Fitzpatrick, making it consistent to label each referring expression as [IN].	1636918476.0	steelers	lions	780	Quack	2.0	0.665339946746826	0.42331522986307657

Since the commenter is likely expressing preemptive frustration or concern about an opponent's long drive, this implicitly refers to the out-group team, the Buccaneers, achieving this drive. Since there is no explicit word or phrase mentioning the out-group, the entire sentence is tagged as '[SENT]' and labeled '[OUT]'.	EXPLANATION: The low win probability indicates that the in-group team (Falcons) is not doing well and is probably on defense. The comment anticipates a long, presumably successful drive, which would be bad news for the in-group team. Therefore, the comment is implicitly about the out-group (Buccaneers) potentially making a 95-yard, 10-minute drive. Since there is no explicit mention of a team, the [SENT] tag has been applied to the entire sentence to denote the implicit reference to the out-group team.	1632091328.0	falcons	buccaneers	1063		4.0	0.18886840343475297	0.8272071755188182

Hurts is described as having a horrible game, indicating a negative sentiment towards him, which suggests he plays for the opponent team, thus 'hurts' should be tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be discussing players from both teams. 'Dean' is mentioned positively in the parent comment and not criticized in the current comment, indicating that 'Dean' is likely a player from the in-group team, the Buccaneers. Hence, 'Dean' should be tagged [IN]. The commenter then states that 'hurts' has had a horrible game, which likely refers to Jalen Hurts, a player for the out-group team, the Eagles. Therefore, 'hurts' should be tagged [OUT].	1634263820.0	buccaneers	eagles	1064	:maui: Maui Vea	1.0	0.9677424728870392	0.6021575374314145

Shurmur, referring to Pat Shurmur who is part of the coaching staff for the Broncos, is being criticized. Therefore, 'Shurmur' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group entity.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing frustration over frequent penalties against their team, the Broncos, and attributes this to poor coaching. 'Shurmur' refers to Pat Shurmur, who was the offensive coordinator for the Broncos. Given that the comment is referring to someone within the Broncos' coaching staff, 'Shurmur' should be tagged as [IN] since the commenter is including him as part of the in-group. This is consistent with the context provided by the parent comment and the low win probability indicating potential dissatisfaction with their team’s performance.	1641165642.0	broncos	chargers	1065	:CWxQy4O:	2.0	0.014932951889932045	0.7940485512920908

['offensive coaches']	[(32, 49)]	['[IN]']	[5]	The comment suggests uncertainty about the performance of the offensive coaches, without criticizing or praising the coaches outright. This type of discussion is typically relevant to the team that the commenter supports, as fans usually scrutinize their own team's coaching decisions more closely. Given that the in-group team is the Chargers, the term "offensive coaches" is most likely referring to the in-group (Chargers) coaches rather than those of the out-group (Browns). Therefore, tagging "offensive coaches" with [IN] is appropriate.  The commenter is questioning the effectiveness of the offensive coaches, which is an analysis commonly directed towards one's own team. Since the commenter is a Chargers fan, it is reasonable to interpret the term "offensive coaches" as referring to the Chargers' offensive coaching staff, thereby warranting the [IN] tag.	EXPLANATION: This comment is likely referring to the in-group team because the commenter is reflecting on the strategy or performance of the offensive coaches. Since 'offensive coaches' is not specified as belonging to the opponent (Browns), it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is speaking about their own team's coaches, i.e., the Chargers. The win probability is close to 50%, indicating a relatively even game, so it’s plausible that the commenter is contemplating the efficacy of their own team's coaching staff. Thus, 'offensive coaches' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team.	1665337841.0	chargers	browns	1066		2.0	0.45568565586507503	0.26731391585760517

Since the commenter supports the Vikings and they are criticizing Cook, it suggests that Cook is a player for the Vikings (the in-group team). Therefore, 'Cook' should be tagged as [IN], referring to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment demonstrates frustration or disappointment with a player named Cook. Given that the win probability is relatively high for the in-group (Vikings), it indicates the Vikings are likely leading, yet the commenter still criticizes Cook. This suggests Cook is a player on the in-group team, as supporters typically criticize their own team members to express dissatisfaction. Therefore, 'Cook' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a player on the in-group team the commenter supports.	1665946334.0	vikings	dolphins	1067	Purple to pale in 60 seconds	6.0	0.80205911397934	0.5893897302625684

Therefore, the pronoun "He" in both sentences refers to Mac Jones. Similarly, "him" and "his targets" in the first sentence, and "his hands" in the second sentence also refer to Mac Jones. These should all be tagged as [IN] since they refer to the in-group team. The emphasis on the quarterback's performance and the need for him to improve (i.e., "get the ball out of his hands much quicker") indicates that the focus is on an in-group player, supporting the [IN] tag for all the referring expressions.	EXPLANATION: The larger context provided by the parent comment indicates that the discussion is about Mac Jones, a quarterback for the Patriots, which is the in-group team for the commenter. Therefore, all instances of "He," "him," "his targets," and "his hands" in the comment are referring to Mac Jones. Given that the win probability is 0.0%, meaning the Patriots are about to lose or have already lost, the critique is directed towards their own quarterback. Hence, "He" should be tagged [IN], "him" should be tagged [IN], "his targets" should be tagged [IN], "He" should be tagged [IN], and "his hands" should be tagged [IN], because they all refer to the in-group player, Mac Jones.	1667163803.0	patriots	jets	1068	:jersey80:	1.0	0.0	1.0

The second sentence is an expression of frustration that is more generally directed and does not explicitly refer to any team or entity. Therefore, 'Bowles' is rightly tagged as [OTHER], and there are no other specific references to entities in the comment that need additional tagging.	EXPLANATION: Todd Bowles was a former head coach of the Jets but is not currently coaching the Jets or the Falcons. The phrase "Fire Bowles" refers to him, which means it should be tagged as [OTHER] since he is not currently associated with either the in-group (Jets) or the out-group (Falcons). The second sentence lacks an explicit reference to an entity, but it is a reaction to a specific play, likely involving the in-group given the low win probability and common tendency for fans to react to their own team's performance. However, because there are no explicit references to in-group entities in the second sentence, it remains untagged. Thus 'Bowles' is correctly tagged as [OTHER].	1633882332.0	jets	falcons	1069		5.0	0.10316681861877397	0.8947869101978692
test	s4yfby	hsus7yu	t1_hsus2re	[SENT] [IN] had 800 yards this year . [SENT] Pretty damn good season considering how little talent [IN] have offensively . 	['Our leading receiver', 'we']	[(7, 27), (115, 117)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	The commenter is likely referring to the in-group team, the Patriots, given the context. The use of 'Our leading receiver' suggests ownership and possession, indicating it refers to the team supported by the commenter. It is rare for fans to talk positively or in detail about the accomplishments of players from the opponent team, in this case, the Bills. Additionally, the phrase 'how little talent we have offensively' uses 'we', which is a common self-referential term used by fans to describe their own team. Thus, both 'Our leading receiver' and 'we' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group team, the Patriots.	EXPLANATION: The first sentence discusses the performance of "our leading receiver," which implicitly refers to a player on the commenter’s in-group team, the Patriots. The use of "our" denotes possession and belonging to the in-group. Thus, "[our leading receiver]" should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence continues to discuss the larger offensive performance of the team, stating "Pretty damn good season considering how little talent we have offensively." Here, "we" is a collective pronoun referring to the team the commenter supports, which in this case is the Patriots. Therefore, "we" should also be tagged with [IN]. Given that the win probability is extremely low (0.1%), the commenter appears to be engaging in post-game analysis about their team's performance over the season rather than the current game situation. This is why both references are tagged [IN].	1642302953.0	patriots	bills	1070	GOAT	2.0	0.0006549868267029524	0.6867389649923896

Since the primary context is an NFL game between the Chiefs (in-group) and the Chargers (out-group), 'Oklahoma' can be seen as part of the in-group associations the commenter has, and 'chiefs' is explicitly the in-group team. Therefore, both 'Oklahoma' and 'chiefs' should be tagged as [IN], reflecting the commenter's affiliations.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing their frustration with being a fan of both Oklahoma and the Chiefs this weekend. Since the 'chiefs' are the in-group with respect to the commenter, it should be tagged with [IN]. 'Oklahoma' here refers to the University of Oklahoma's sports teams, which the commenter is also a fan of, and should be tagged with [IN] as well, since they are indicating a shared allegiance to multiple teams, both of which they support.	1632679366.0	chiefs	chargers	1071		2.0	0.265739381313324	0.32238725841088045

['[SENT]', 'the offense', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (54, 65), (76, 82)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The first sentence indicates some dissatisfaction with only getting a field goal instead of a touchdown, likely referring to the opponent's (out-group) scoring. Therefore, it should be tagged [OUT] since it pertains to the opponent's field goal. In the second sentence, "the offense" refers to the commenter's team as it's now their turn to respond, indicating this refers to the in-group team, the Commanders. So "the offense" should be tagged with [IN]. The third sentence expresses the desire for the commenter's team to have a successful offensive drive. This is implicit support for their team, so the sentence should be tagged with [IN].  Thus, '[SENT]' in the second and third sentences should be tagged with [IN] since the comments are referring to the in-group implicitly.	The in-group team, Commanders, has a low win probability of 32.9%, indicating they are likely not in a favorable position. In the first sentence, “The 3 will have to do there,” the commenter is acknowledging a likely field goal by the opposing team, the Giants, which aligns with the out-group's scoring action; thus, the sentence should be tagged [OUT]. The second sentence, “Now it’s the offense’s turn,” switches focus to the in-group, Commanders, specifically mentioning their offense getting the turn, so "the offense" should be tagged [IN]. The final sentence, “Need a money drive here,” is an implicit encouragement to the in-group's team to score, addressing the immediate need for a significant offensive drive for the Commanders. Therefore, both [SENT] tokens for the second and third sentences should be tagged with [IN], since the commenter is referring to the in-group implicitly.	1671420500.0	commanders	giants	1072	Fuck Dan Snyder	1.0	0.328873753547668	0.6749192680301399

Fans typically praise players from their own team, so 'Renfrow' is tagged with [IN] to indicate that he belongs to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: Renfrow is a player for the Raiders, which is the in-group team. Given that the commenter is praising Renfrow by calling him "a fucking dogggggg," it suggests a positive sentiment towards the player, which aligns with the supporter's in-group affiliation. The win probability is fairly balanced at 50.7%, meaning the game could go either way, but this comment indicates a positive view towards an in-group player regardless of the game's current standing. Thus 'Renfrow' should be tagged [IN] since he is a player for the in-group team the commenter supports.	1640554644.0	raiders	broncos	1073	:maxx_condor:	7.0	0.507487416267395	0.07848101265822785

Therefore, 'He' is tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player who the commenter believes performed poorly.	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses frustration with a specific player, suggesting that they should not be allowed back "in the building tomorrow." The lack of a parent comment provides no additional context, but the in-group team's low win probability (35.3%) indicates poor performance and dissatisfaction from the commenter. Given that fans typically criticize their team's own players more harshly than the opponent's, it is reasonable to infer that "He" refers to a player from the Jets, the in-group team. Therefore, "He" should be tagged with [IN] because the commenter is likely expressing disappointment with their own team's player.	1671395104.0	jets	lions	1074	:LogoRetroWordmark:	4.0	0.352501541376114	0.7748819469669451

The comment is celebrating a sack by Buckner, thus 'Defo' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. The sentence as a whole implies satisfaction related to the in-group player’s performance.	EXPLANATION: The win probability is 0.0%, which signifies that the in-group team, the Colts, has likely lost at this point in the game. Despite this, the comment describes a "perfect ending" with a "Defo sack." DeForest Buckner (nicknamed Defo) is an in-group player for the Colts and is well-known for his defensive capabilities. Therefore, the word "Defo" refers to an in-group player, making the sentiment of the perfect ending related to something positive about the in-group. Hence, "Defo" should be tagged as [IN].	1635132317.0	colts	49ers	1075	Earl Grey	9.0	0.0	1.0

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses frustration with a strategic decision made during a critical moment in the game, likely referring to the in-group team (Raiders). The commenter is implicitly criticizing their own team's decision-making by suggesting a better approach. Since the complaint and the advice are directed towards the team the commenter supports (the Raiders), the sentiment indicates that the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as there is no explicit word/phrase but the frustration is directed towards the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter's team, the Raiders, has a very low win probability, indicating they are likely losing and struggling to score. The comment implicitly criticizes a play call or strategy by the in-group (Raiders) without explicitly naming them, suggesting that the commenter is frustrated with their team’s decision-making. Since the sentence is implicitly about the in-group needing to score and questioning their approach, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to indicate that the entire sentence refers to the in-group.	1642292658.0	raiders	bengals	1076		3.0	0.05496982857584998	0.8616079032532789

Further, "the defense" is mentioned without any qualifications, making it likely that the commenter is referring to the Steelers' defense (the in-group). Fans usually criticize and talk about specific strategies or deficiencies of their own team, which aligns with the tone of frustration here directed at the in-group team's performance. Therefore, "We" and "the defense" should be tagged with [IN].  The use of 'We' indicates the commenter is talking about their own team, the Steelers, thus it should be tagged [IN]. 'the defense' also refers to the in-group team's defense, as the frustration is directed at their own team's performance, so it should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The term "we" usually refers to the in-group, especially when expressing a collective concern or action. Here, the commenter is frustrated about not moving the ball and relying too much on the defense, which indicates that "we" refers to the Steelers, the in-group. Similarly, "the defense" is part of the Steelers team, suggesting it is the in-group's defense under discussion. Since there's frustration about the Steelers' performance, it makes sense considering their low win probability at the time. Therefore, "We" and "the defense" are tagged [IN] as they clearly refer to the in-group.	1641759087.0	steelers	ravens	1077	The Bus	3.0	0.267605364322662	0.6158395268920323

"Kevin" here refers to Kenneth Walker III, a player for the Seahawks, which is the in-group team. The nickname explanation indicates a positive association ('WOOF WOOF'), likely used affectionately by fans. Thus, 'Kevin' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is responding to a question about a nickname, specifically referring to 'Kevin' who is Kenneth Walker III, a player on the in-group team, the Seahawks. The nickname 'K9' and the playful 'WOOF WOOF' sound reflect fandom and support for this player, reinforcing that 'Kevin' refers to an in-group entity. The high win probability suggests that Seahawks fans are likely to be in high spirits and engaged in positive commentary about their own players, hence 'Kevin' should be tagged with [IN].	1665959504.0	seahawks	cardinals	1079		1.0	0.823380750518307	0.7753887161261661

'Tomlin' refers to Mike Tomlin, who is the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers (the in-group). Therefore, 'Tomlin' should be tagged [IN]. 2. 'some of the worst coordinators in the league' is referring to the coordinators hired within the in-group team, and thus should be tagged [IN]. 3. 'Ben' refers to Ben Roethlisberger, the quarterback for the Steelers, making him part of the in-group. Therefore, 'Ben' should be tagged [IN]. 4. 'he' also refers to Ben Roethlisberger based on context, and should thus be tagged [IN]. The negative comments are directed towards members of the in-group team, showing frustration with the performance and decisions of the team's staff. As such, it is appropriate that these references are tagged [IN].	The commenter is criticizing Mike Tomlin, who is the head coach of the Steelers, the in-group team. 'Tomlin' is therefore tagged [IN] because he is a member of the in-group. The phrase 'some of the worst coordinators in the league' refers to coordinators hired by Tomlin for the Steelers, so this should also be tagged [IN]. 'Ben' refers to Ben Roethlisberger, the quarterback for the Steelers, hence it is tagged [IN]. Finally, 'he' in the context of the sentence refers to Ben Roethlisberger and is therefore tagged [IN] as well. The extremely low win probability of 0.3% suggests that the team is performing poorly, which aligns with the critical nature of the comment about members of the in-group.	1638128504.0	steelers	bengals	26		10.0	0.0025987778790299565	0.5534205885083078

In the second sentence, the commenter is calling on their team's offense to score, which they are addressing as "Offense". Therefore, "Offense" should be tagged [IN]. The first sentence doesn't contain explicit references to any entities, but it's about the in-group team, so `[SENT]` is tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The low win probability indicates that the in-group team, the Cowboys, is currently not doing well in the game. The first sentence, "Needed that stop," implicitly refers to the team's defense successfully stopping the opponent, which is seen as a positive moment for the in-group despite the overall low probability of winning; thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN]. In the second sentence, the commenter directly calls out the "Offense" to step up and score, implying a motivational address to their own team's offensive unit. This indicates that "Offense" refers to the in-group. Therefore, 'Offense' is also tagged with [IN].	1636313928.0	cowboys	broncos	1080		1.0	0.269136667251587	0.5271594760465329

['he', 'his']	[(14, 16), (48, 51)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]']	[3, 3]	 The parent comment mentions Garrett supporting the Eagles, which implies that 'he' in the current comment refers to Garrett as well. Garrett was the head coach of the Cowboys, another team in the NFL, which makes him an entity not affiliated with the in-group (Eagles) or the out-group (Cowboys, the current opponent). Therefore, 'he' and 'his' should be tagged as [OTHER], as Garrett represents another team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group. The term 'us' refers to the in-group (Eagles), but 'he' in this context is linked to Garrett, hence the correct tags are applied to Garrett as [OTHER].	The parent comment clarifies that Garrett is supporting the Eagles, which suggests that Garrett is not a player or figure directly associated with the Eagles or the Cowboys, but someone external. Given that Garrett is being talked about in the context of the Eagles-Cowboys game, he is most likely a former or current coach/player of another team, making him an '[OTHER]' entity. 'he' and 'his' in the comment therefore refer to Garrett as an external entity to the in-group (Eagles) and out-group (Cowboys), so they should be tagged '[OTHER]'. Although the term 'us' appears and is in reference to the in-group, the explicit referring expressions 'he' and 'his' point to Garrett and need to be correctly identified as '[OTHER]'.	1665972107.0	eagles	cowboys	1081		2.0	0.980824768543243	0.547332345313079

"we" in the second sentence refers to the in-group team, as the commenter is reflecting on their own team's strategy and performance over the season. 2. "Hurts" in the third sentence refers to Jalen Hurts, the quarterback for the Eagles, who is part of the in-group. 3. "we" in the third sentence also refers to the Eagles, indicating the team's improved performance since they changed their strategy. All these references are related to the in-group team, the Eagles, which is why they are tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is clearly reflecting on the performance of their in-group team, the Eagles, now that their win probability is at 100%. The use of "we" is a strong indication that the commenter is talking about their own team, and thus it should be tagged as [IN]. The name "Hurts" refers to Jalen Hurts, a quarterback for the Eagles, indicating that this player is part of the in-group, so it should be tagged as [IN]. The second instance of "we" should also be tagged as [IN] for the same reason as the first instance, as it refers to the in-group team, the Eagles. This tagging accurately reflects the commenter's focus on their own team.	1637528868.0	eagles	saints	804		10.0	0.999683822446968	0.9580280961820219

The comment indicates that Metcalf, an opposing player, is wide open, which is an issue for the commenter supporting the Cardinals. Therefore, 'Metcalf' should be tagged with [OUT] as it refers to the out-group player.	EXPLANATION: In this comment, 'Metcalf' refers to DK Metcalf, who is a player for the Seahawks, the out-group in this scenario. The in-group team is the Cardinals, and the low win probability suggests they are currently losing. The commenter notes that Metcalf is wide open, which indicates a defensive lapse by the in-group. Since Metcalf is part of the out-group, he should be tagged with [OUT]. There are no other explicit entities or phrases referring to the in-group; hence the remaining sentence structure isn't tagged further. Thus, 'Metcalf' is correctly tagged as [OUT].	1665959071.0	cardinals	seahawks	906	:cardinals: Cardinals	5.0	0.29905402660369895	0.7369169258107507

['Hump']	[(19, 23)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment appears to be lamenting a missed opportunity by a player named 'Hump,' which is likely a nickname for Marlon Humphrey, a player for the Ravens. The first sentence expresses frustration, and the second sentence directly addresses 'Hump' for almost making a play. Since Marlon Humphrey is part of the Ravens, he is in the in-group. Therefore, 'Hump' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to an in-group player. The other parts of the comment do not explicitly mention any entity, so they are left untagged or correctly tagged as [SENT].	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 92.5% indicates the Ravens (the in-group) are in a strong position, which typically means the commenter is likely talking about the in-group team. 'Hump' refers to Marlon Humphrey, a player for the Ravens. Commenters often use nicknames or shortenings of players' names, especially for players on the team they support. Therefore, 'Hump' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a Ravens player, the in-group team. The first "[SENT]" does not contain an explicit reference but follows immediately after "Damn" which is a response to an action likely done by a member of the in-group, reinforcing the in-group context.	1634493686.0	ravens	chargers	516		2.0	0.924990497529507	0.3392168209876543

The commenter is likely criticizing their own team as fans generally feel stronger emotions towards their in-group team. Since the comment does not contain specific names or indicators of the opposing team, we assume that the commenter is referring to the Colts, their in-group team. In the first sentence, '[SENT]' is tagged as '[IN]' because the overall tone and context of the comment suggest that the commenter is referring to the in-group's performance. In the second sentence, the word 'Team' should also be tagged '[IN]' as it refers to the in-group team that is being booed for the performance mentioned in the first sentence. The phrases "dog shit performance" and "deserves to be booed" indicate a strong negative reaction typically aimed at one's own team when they underperform. Therefore, '[SENT]' and 'Team' are tagged as referring to the in-group team, the Colts.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is unhappy with the performance, which is reflective of the in-group team despite the relatively high win probability. Fans typically criticize their own team for poor performances rather than the opponent. The phrase 'Team deserves to be booed for this' indicates that the commenter is not pleased with how their team is playing, even if they are leading the game. Thus, the first sentence is implicitly about the in-group team’s poor performance, so '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN]. 'Team' in the second sentence explicitly refers to the in-group team and should also be tagged as [IN].	1636923271.0	colts	jaguars	501	Playoffs? PLAYOFFS!?	6.0	0.757415592670441	0.8810459750470006

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[2]	 The absence of explicit references to either the in-group or out-group suggests the commenter is providing a neutral description of a play involving their team. Given that fans typically discuss play actions and fouls more critically with respect to their own team, it is likely they are talking about the in-group team (Titans in this case). Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to indicate the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment is discussing a play action and a foul, which are usually significant and immediate events in a game. With a slight advantage in win probability (54.1%), it's more likely that the commenter is focusing on the in-group team, the Titans, and their performance. Since there are no explicit references to either team, the sentence is implicitly about the in-group. Therefore, the entire sentence, represented by '[SENT]', should be tagged with '[IN]' as it reflects the in-group team's context.	1669580163.0	titans	bengals	1083		2.0	0.540715754032135	0.7636640639878118

The use of 'at least' suggests a somewhat positive, if somewhat resigned, comment about an in-group player. Therefore, 'PJ' is tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The win probability is 0.0%, indicating the Panthers are certain to lose and the commenter may be looking for a silver lining. PJ Walker is the quarterback for the Panthers, thus the comment is referring to an in-group player. With this in mind, 'PJ' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1665356767.0	panthers	49ers	1084		6.0	0.0001071502410923	0.9688924644676857

['Cleveland', 'Cleveland', 'Buffalo']	[(43, 52), (64, 73), (108, 115)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter is a fan of the Bills (in-group) and is referring to another game where Cleveland (Browns, out-group) is making mistakes, which is beneficial to the Bills. When the commenter says "Cleveland is beating Cleveland," it is a sarcastic way to suggest that Cleveland (out-group) is self-sabotaging, but within the context of supporting the Bills, the first instance of "Cleveland" and the second instance of "Cleveland" should be tagged as [IN] because it symbolizes the positive turn for the in-group (Bills). "Buffalo" refers to the Bills (in-group), so it should be tagged as [OUT] since the commenter appears to think Buffalo might not exploit the break.	The win probability is relatively balanced at 46.3%, indicating an evenly matched game. The first sentence is a general exclamation of relief or joy without reference to any specific team, so '[SENT]' remains untagged. The second sentence states "Good thing Cleveland is beating Cleveland," which could be interpreted as a sarcastic or humorous remark implying internal conflict or poor performance within the team. Since the commenter supports the Bills (in-group) and is using "Cleveland" to refer to a team failing internally, "Cleveland" here is tagged as [IN] twice, reflecting the in-group team (Bills) beating itself up figuratively. In the last sentence, "Buffalo" refers to an opponent that the commenter perceives as not performing well, so "Buffalo" is tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group opponent, the Browns.	1668970333.0	bills	browns	1085	12	5.0	0.462566673755646	0.256372843532744

The pronoun "his" also refers to Zach Wilson, making it [IN] as well. The phrase "our entire offensive staff" indicates that the commenter is referring to the coaching staff of the in-group team they support, which is the Jets, and thus should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, all entities correctly refer to the in-group team, the Jets.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is referring to 'zach', who is likely Zach Wilson, a player for the Jets (the in-group team). The use of the term 'ass' without elaboration suggests familiarity, indicative of the commenter discussing their own team. Additionally, 'his' lack of development and 'our entire offensive staff' both pertain to Zach’s performance and the Jets' coaching team, respectively. These references make it clear that the entire sentence is discussing issues within the in-group team, which is the Jets. Therefore, 'zach', 'his', and 'our entire offensive staff' should all be tagged as [IN].	1672616352.0	jets	seahawks	1086		8.0	0.041828453540802	0.8357992193882182

'cardinals', 'Josh rosen', 'him', 'Cardinals', 'Kyler', and 'rosen' all refer to entities associated with the Cardinals team and should thus be tagged as [OTHER], since the Cardinals are neither the Jets (in-group) nor the Patriots (out-group). The commenter then makes a reference to Wilson, a player on the Jets, implying a comparison to Rosen. As the commenter is a Jets fan, 'wilson' should be tagged as [IN] for the in-group, while 'rosen' remains tagged as [OTHER] under the implied comparison context.	EXPLANATION: The comment references the 2019 season of the Arizona Cardinals, wherein 'Josh rosen' and 'rosen' refer to Josh Rosen, a former Cardinals quarterback. The 'Cardinals fo' refers to the Cardinals front office, and 'Kyler' refers to Kyler Murray, the current quarterback of the Cardinals. These references should be tagged [OTHER] since the Cardinals are neither the in-group (Jets) nor the out-group (Patriots) for the commenter. The final part of the comment makes a comparison between Zach Wilson, a current Jets player, and Josh Rosen, implying 'wilson' is referring to the in-group Jets player. Similarly, 'rosen' continues to refer to the Cardinals' past quarterback, maintaining the [OTHER] tag. Hence, 'cardinals', 'Josh rosen', 'him', 'Cardinals', 'Kyler', and 'rosen' should all be tagged [OTHER], while 'wilson' should be tagged [IN].	1632075586.0	jets	patriots	873		-13.0	0.123070359230042	0.43347076461769113

['we']	[(15, 17)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The pronoun 'we' is usually used by fans to refer to their own team. In this context, the commenter is discussing the performance of the quarterback in their team's system, which indicates a focus on their own team, the 49ers. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team (the 49ers) supported by the commenter.	EXPLANATION: The use of "we" strongly indicates that the commenter is talking about their own team, the 49ers. This pronoun usage is typically reserved for in-group references, as fans often use "we" to refer to the team they support. The context of the comment further suggests disappointment, possibly in the performance of the 49ers' quarterback within their system (given the low win probability of 17.0%). Hence, "we" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, the 49ers.	1675028023.0	49ers	eagles	1087		2.0	0.17015045881271396	0.4856118415004137

Therefore, the first 'he' refers to Hurts and should be tagged [IN] since Hurts is part of the in-group. In the second sentence, 'They' refers to the Buccaneers, who are the out-group team, thus it should be tagged [OUT]. The second 'he' again refers to Hurts, the quarterback for the Eagles, and should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The parent comment asks about Hurts, who is a quarterback (QB) for the Eagles, which indicates that he is the subject of the comment. The low win probability indicates the Eagles are losing, supporting the critical tone about the in-group player. Thus, 'he' in the first sentence refers to Hurts, making it [IN]. In the second sentence, 'They' clearly refers to the out-group, the Buccaneers, who are forcing the in-group to throw. The second 'he' again refers to Hurts' inability, so it should be tagged [IN]. Therefore, 'he' in the first sentence, 'They' in the second sentence, and the second 'he' all have the correct tags for [IN] and [OUT].	1642364931.0	eagles	buccaneers	1088		1.0	0.00010097026824995581	0.7639396913194754

The repetitive use of "Kirk" and the contextual frustration expressed by the phrase "Vikings fans" both directly relate to the in-group team, the Vikings. The commenter appears to be highlighting the contradictory nature of the fans' criticisms and preferences regarding Kirk Cousins's play decisions. The targeted output correctly tags all mentions of "Kirk" and "Vikings" as [IN] because they directly refer to the player's actions and the fans' opinions towards the in-group team the commenter supports, the Vikings.	EXPLANATION: In this comment, the references to 'Kirk' and 'Vikings' can be deciphered within the context of the game between the Vikings and Bears. The in-group team is the Vikings, and Kirk Cousins is the quarterback for the Vikings. The comment revolves around the indecisive opinions of Vikings fans about Cousins' playing style, whether he should be more aggressive or more conservative. Hence, the instances 'Kirk' and 'Vikings' are all referring to entities associated with the in-group and should be tagged [IN]. Furthermore, the commenter is discussing the performance and decisions of an in-group player (Kirk) and the reactions of the in-group fans, making it clear these references should be tagged as in-group entities.	1665343148.0	vikings	bears	1089		0.0	0.677010774612427	0.8067980295566503

Thus, it is reasonable to infer that "He" in the comment is also referring to an in-group player, specifically Kyle Juszczyk. Therefore, "He" should be tagged [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports (49ers).	The parent comment references "Juice," which is a nickname for Kyle Juszczyk, a player on the in-group team (49ers). The high win probability for the in-group shows that the game is going favorably, and there's no indication of discussing an opponent's player in this context. Therefore, "He" refers to Juszczyk, implying the need for more opportunities to affect the game positively for the 49ers. Hence, "He" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group player. "[SENT]" should also be tagged with [IN] because the entire comment pertains to the in-group's strategy.	1665354073.0	49ers	panthers	1090	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	2.0	0.9637570381164551	0.7280772325020113

['Bills']	[(55, 60)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The commenter is a Dolphins fan, and the comment refers to the Bills, which are neither the Dolphins (in-group) nor the Jets (out-group). Hence, 'Bills' should be tagged as [OTHER] as it refers to another NFL team that is not directly involved with the in-group or out-group for this particular commenter. This indicates the commenter is rooting for a team (Bills) that is unrelated to their primary rivalry (Dolphins vs Jets) in this instance.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a Dolphins fan, and the in-group team is the Dolphins while the out-group team is the Jets. The comment 'lets go Bills' suggests cheering for the Bills, which is not the in-group or out-group team but another team in the NFL, therefore it should be tagged as [OTHER]. The phrase 'Bills' specifically refers to the Buffalo Bills, another NFL team, hence it is tagged [OTHER] too. The win probability of 57.3% suggests the game is competitive, but this does not affect the tagging in this case. The commenter might be wanting the Bills to win for some strategic reason that benefits the Dolphins indirectly.	1673203123.0	dolphins	jets	1091		6.0	0.573386251926422	0.19760089269109168

The commenter is likely addressing other supporters of the Chiefs by providing injury status information about one of their players. Therefore, 'Darrell Williams' should be tagged as [IN], since he is part of the in-group team. The rest of the sentences do not specify entities related to the in-group, out-group, or others directly.	EXPLANATION: Darrell Williams is a player for the Kansas City Chiefs, the in-group team that the commenter supports. The comment provides an injury update on him, which is relevant to fans closely following their own team's players. Given that the commenter addresses 'You guys' in the second sentence, it suggests they were likely responding to other fans (presumably Chiefs fans) inquiring about Williams' status. Thus, 'Darrell Williams' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to an in-group player. The second and third sentences are general statements that don't explicitly reference any entities.	1641686155.0	chiefs	broncos	1092	MVP incoming 	3.0	0.587264180183411	0.8178065484567033

Given this context, "he" in the child comment most likely refers to the same player from the Dolphins. Therefore, "he" should be tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The parent comment discusses an incident involving a player who suffered a significant occipital impact, suggesting he should not return to the game due to suspected concussion. Since the parent comment is about a player from the Dolphins (the out-group team), the response 'Bruh he’s back' logically refers to the same player returning to the game. The commenter appears surprised or disapproving of this situation. As such, 'he' in this context should be tagged as [OUT] since it refers to a player from the out-group team, the Dolphins. Therefore, the correct tagged output is '[SENT] Bruh [OUT] ’s back', with 'he' being the tagged referring expression.	1664131509.0	bills	dolphins	1094	:BUF:	3.0	0.6255135238170619	0.5393928759431479

['This team']	[(7, 16)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The phrase 'This team' refers to the team that the commenter supports, which is the in-group team (the Patriots). This is clear because the comment is expressing frustration and disappointment, something fans typically direct towards their own team when they are underperforming. Therefore, 'This team' should be tagged as [IN]. The use of 'WE' also implies the commenter is associating themselves with the in-group team, further supporting that 'This team' refers to the Patriots.	Given the context of a low win probability (10.8%) and a comment expressing frustration, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is criticizing the in-group team, the Patriots. The phrase "This team" typically refers to the team that the commenter supports, especially when expressing disappointment or anger. Additionally, "we" is another indication that the commenter is referring to their own team, further confirming that "This team" is referring to the in-group, the Patriots.  Thus, the phrase "This team" should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.   EXPLANATION: The comment clearly indicates frustration and disappointment with the performance of the in-group team, the Patriots. The win probability is quite low, which aligns with the negative sentiment. The phrase "This team" typically refers to the team the commenter supports, particularly in a context where they are expressing dissatisfaction. Therefore, "This team" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the Patriots.	1640548557.0	patriots	bills	1095		1.0	0.108318746089935	0.5898058252427184

The commenter appears to be frustrated with Amani's performance this season as compared to last season, which suggests that Amani is a player they support, not one from the opponent. Therefore, 'Amani,' 'He,' and 'he' should all be tagged with [IN] as they refer to a player on the in-group team, the Lions. The third sentence contains no direct reference to either team and simply speaks to the confusion surrounding Amani's performance, so it remains untagged.	EXPLANATION: The comment is discussing Amani, a player, and lamenting about his drastic decline in performance, which is something fans typically do for their own team's players. Since Amani Oruwariye is a player for the Lions, the in-group team, references to 'Amani', 'He', and 'he' should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability being 56.0% suggests that the Lions have a slight edge but it isn't a runaway victory, so concerns about individual players' performances are reasonable discussion points. Therefore, all these references should be tagged with [IN], as they refer to the in-group player Amani Oruwariye.	1667156119.0	lions	dolphins	1096	Hail Martha full of grace	1.0	0.560207545757294	0.6649286768322676

The term 'BUM ASS DONKEYS' is a derogatory reference to the Broncos, aligning with the commenter's support for the Raiders. Since the entire comment is making fun of the out-group, the entire sentence should be tagged with [OUT]. Therefore, '[SENT]' is correctly tagged with [OUT] since there is no explicit word/phrase that refers to the out-group, but the comment as a whole is directed at the out-group.	The comment is derogatory and mocking in nature, which implies that it is directed towards the opponent team. The in-group team is the Raiders, and the out-group opponent team is the Broncos. Given the high win probability for the in-group at 99.7%, it is likely that the Raiders are winning comfortably, leading the commenter to mock the Broncos' fans for leaving. The phrase "BUM ASS DONKEYS" is a derogatory way to refer to the Broncos, who are commonly nicknamed the "Donkeys" in a mocking manner by their opponents. Thus, the sentence is implicitly about the out-group and should be tagged [OUT]. Even though there isn't an explicit named entity from the out-group, the entire sentence contextually refers to them. Therefore, '[SENT]' is correctly tagged as [OUT].	1634512838.0	raiders	broncos	1097		15.0	0.9969453215599061	0.9227188899622376

This suggests that 'him' refers to an in-group player who the commenter wants to defend. As they are discussing a player making a rare mistake (fumbling the ball), it makes sense that 'him' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player on the Giants.	The parent comment is defending a player from criticism, and the follow-up comment continues this defense by expressing that it's rare to see "him" fumble the ball. With a low win probability for the Giants, it's likely that the commenter is a supporter of the Giants and feels the need to defend their own player. Therefore, "him" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a player from the in-group team, the Giants, whom the commenter supports. This defense is common when fans want to show loyalty or point out that an error was uncharacteristic for their team.  EXPLANATION: The parent comment is defending a player, implying it's unfair to blame him. The follow-up comment continues this line of thought, emphasizing that fumbling the ball is rare for "him." Given that the in-group team has a low win probability (8.1%) and the context of defending a player, "him" clearly refers to a player from the commenter’s team, the Giants. Thus, "him" should be tagged [IN].	1662930962.0	giants	titans	1099		-2.0	0.08148926496505704	0.2760724852071006

['We', 'the Dolphins']	[(32, 34), (56, 68)]	['[IN]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5]	 The sentence "We fucked it up against the Dolphins and it made me so mad" expresses frustration about a past incident involving the commenter's team. The use of "We" typically implies the in-group team, which in this context refers to the Bills. "The Dolphins" refers to another team that is neither the in-group (Bills) nor the out-group (Bears) in this context. Thus, "We" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, and "the Dolphins" should be tagged with [OTHER] since it refers to a team other than the Bills or Bears. The phrase "This is the way" does not contain any explicit reference to either team and thus doesn't require tagging.	The comment discusses a past game against the Dolphins, who are not the current opponent (the Bears). 'We' typically refers to the in-group team, which in this case, is the Bills. The commenter expresses frustration about a previous game against the Dolphins, who are not relevant to the current game. Hence, 'We' should be tagged as [IN], referring to the Bills, and 'the Dolphins' should be tagged as [OTHER], indicating another team in the NFL that is not the out-group opponent. The first sentence in the comment doesn’t have any explicit references to any team, so no tagging is necessary for that part.	1671908675.0	bills	bears	26		2.0	0.6452295184135439	0.34223368013995026

The use of "we" indicates that the commenter identifies with the in-group team, the Broncos. "russ" refers to Russell Wilson, a player for the Broncos, thus also making it an in-group reference. Therefore, "We" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, and "russ" should also be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	The commenter uses the word 'We,' which almost always refers to the in-group team they support. In this case, the commenter supports the Broncos, so 'We' should be tagged as [IN]. The mention of 'russ' refers to Russell Wilson, who is a quarterback for the Broncos (the in-group). Given that the team's win probability is extremely low at 0.2%, it suggests that they are not performing well, further indicating that the commenter is lamenting the performance of the in-group team. Thus both 'We' and 'russ' should be tagged as [IN].	1664753524.0	broncos	raiders	1100	Lord Elway	2.0	0.0022929906845090553	0.9917531258313381

Since penalties can be called on any team, this could apply to any team in the NFL, thus the '[SENT]' for the first sentence is tagged as [OTHER]. The second sentence is an expression of dislike for such games with frequent penalties, but it does not specifically mention or refer to the in-group (Chargers) or the out-group (Seahawks). Therefore, '[SENT]' in the second sentence is left untagged as it is a general statement.	The first sentence of the comment, 'Flag on every play,' does not contain a clear in-group or out-group reference, and could apply to any game within the NFL, making it reasonable to tag the entire sentence with [OTHER]. The second sentence, 'Hate these type of games,' more generally refers to the type of game (involving many flags or penalties), without explicitly mentioning any particular team. Since 'Hate these type of games' reflects a general sentiment about the nature of the game and does not specify in-group or out-group, the entire sentence is tagged with [SENT]. Therefore, tagging 'Flag on every play' with [OTHER] is appropriate since it could refer to a general issue within the NFL, and '[SENT]' in the second sentence should be tagged because no specific team (either in-group or out-group) is mentioned.	1666557948.0	chargers	seahawks	1101		3.0	0.627868562936783	0.09641387419165197

['[SENT]', 'This defense', 'this offense']	[(0, 6), (75, 87), (107, 119)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The first sentence ('Its hard to imagine...') does not have an explicitly mentioned team, but given the context of the second sentence and the parent comment, it can be inferred that it refers to the out-group's strong performance. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged as [OUT] as it implicitly references the out-group's impending success. In the second sentence, 'This defense' likely refers to the in-group's defense in a struggling state, and 'this offense' refers to the out-group’s strong offensive performance. Therefore, 'This defense' should be tagged [IN] and 'this offense' tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The win probability being 0% suggests that the in-group (Seahawks) has no chance of winning, likely because the game has already ended in defeat. The comment reflects on the situation, saying "the dam wouldn't have burst soon though," referring to the inevitability of the outcome, presumably the 49Ers eventually overcoming the Seahawks' defense.  - The first sentence is clearly about the out-group's offensive success, with 'the dam' metaphorically representing the 49Ers’ offensive pressure. Therefore, the entire sentence is tagged [OUT]. - In the second sentence, 'This defense' refers to the in-group (Seahawks) defense that could not hold up, and 'this offense' refers to the out-group (49Ers). Therefore, 'This defense' is tagged [IN] and 'this offense' is tagged [OUT]. - As 'not gonna hold' refers to the action of the Seahawks defense against the 49Ers offense, the [SENT] token for "This defense was not gonna hold this offense for much longer" as a whole should be tagged [IN], conveying the in-group's sentiment of inevitable failure.	1673741810.0	seahawks	49ers	1102		1.0	0.00010050283890494782	0.9057403482907952
train	q1hx4c	hff97dg	t3_q1hx4c	[SENT] Y’all should ’ve never left [IN] 	['San Diego']	[(35, 44)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is referring to the Chargers, who moved from San Diego to Los Angeles. 'Y'all' indicates that the commenter is addressing the team they support, which is the in-group team, the Chargers. The phrase 'San Diego' references the previous city the in-group team was based in, hence it is tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely addressing the Chargers' move from San Diego to Los Angeles. The use of 'Y’all' implies a direct address to a group that the commenter is referring to, which in this context would be their own in-group, the Chargers, as fans often lament relocations of their own team. The term 'San Diego' is associated with the Chargers' previous location, so it is tagged as [IN]. It is a commentary on their own team's historic decision rather than the current game, supporting the idea that the in-group is involved.	1633394268.0	chargers	raiders	1103		-10.0	0.595943093299866	0.0

'They' in the context of the sentence refers to the out-group team (Falcons), so it should be tagged [OUT]. 'the Chargers' are explicitly mentioned as the in-group team, so it should be tagged [IN]. The comment mocks the Falcons by comparing them to the Chargers, indicating that 'They' refers to the Falcons here. The full comment refers to the Falcons as being similar to the Chargers, thereby linking the in-group characteristics to an out-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment is comparing another team to the Chargers by using the phrase "the Chargers of the NFC," implying that this other team is similar to the Chargers in some way. Given that the comment is about the in-group (Chargers) and it mentions the NFC (where the Falcons, the out-group, play), it is reasonable to infer that "They" refers to the out-group team, the Falcons. “the Chargers” refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, the Chargers. Thus, "They" should be tagged [OUT] and "the Chargers" should be tagged [IN]. The win probability being relatively low suggests the in-group might not be performing well, reinforcing the negative comparison.	1667766034.0	chargers	falcons	1104	⚡️⬆️	5.0	0.353050112724304	0.790221120853984

['RyAn', 'Colt']	[(29, 33), (50, 54)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is talking about individuals who criticized players named Ryan and Colt. Given that this is a game between the Commanders and Jaguars, and the commenter supports the Commanders, it is likely that Ryan and Colt are players on the in-group team (Commanders). The folks who criticized these players are people who directed their criticism towards in-group players. Therefore, "Ryan" and "Colt" should be tagged as [IN], as they refer to players from the in-group. The sentences "[SENT] RyAn sucks" and "[SENT] Colt fucked up" are therefore both implicitly referring to in-group players, and thus should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be mocking those who were criticizing Ryan (likely Ryan Fitzpatrick) and the Colts, who are part of the Commanders (the in-group team the commenter supports). Given the context and typical fan behavior, supporters often respond to criticism when things are not going perfectly, which aligns with the low win probability. 'RyAn' (Fitzpatrick, who likely plays for the Commanders) and 'Colt' (a reference to the team nickname or mascot) refer to the in-group team, the Commanders. Thus, 'Ryan' and 'Colt' should be tagged [IN], reflecting that the comment is about defending and/or calling out detractors of the in-group.	1662925386.0	commanders	jaguars	472		4.0	0.273652017116547	0.8017313834257859

The commenter is likely expressing concern about an injury affecting their own team, making 'we' refer to the in-group. Thus, 'we' should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The word 'we' typically means the commenter is talking about the in-group team and its fans, which in this case is the 49ers. The relatively high win probability suggests that the game is going well for the in-group, but there's concern about an injury to one of their players. Injuries are a common concern among fans irrespective of the match situation, thus 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team and its supporters (49ers).	1663533637.0	49ers	seahawks	1105	:jerseyhome85: George Kittle	3.0	0.833955362439156	0.20657598590860163

train	pre3bz	hdiebbc	t3_pre3bz	[SENT] [IN] looking DIFFERENT today 	['Kirk']	[(7, 11)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment refers to "Kirk," likely Kirk Cousins, who is the quarterback for the Vikings, which is the in-group team the commenter supports. The comment implies that Kirk is performing differently today than usual, which suggests the commenter is closely observing and commenting on a player from their supported team. Therefore, "Kirk" should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: Kirk is shorthand for Kirk Cousins, the quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings, who are the in-group team that the commenter supports. Given that the win probability at the time of the comment is quite high (75.9%), it suggests that the Vikings are performing well, which aligns with the positive observation that "Kirk looking DIFFERENT today." Therefore, "Kirk" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a player on the in-group team.	1632085085.0	vikings	cardinals	1107	moss fro	10.0	0.759451538324356	0.27271941948859707

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is expressing confusion or frustration, which is often directed towards the in-group team when they make a mistake or perform poorly. Since there are no explicit words or phrases that refer to the in-group or out-group, and given that fans are more likely to question or criticize their own team, '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN] to indicate that the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group team, the Packers.	EXPLANATION: The high win probability of 76.1% indicates that the in-group, the Packers, are generally doing well. However, this comment implies a momentary setback or bad play that the commenter is questioning. It is very likely that the commenter is disappointed or confused about a specific play made by the Packers, given that there is no mention of the opponent and the sentiment is questioning. Consequently, the '[SENT]' token should be tagged [IN] since the implicit reference is towards the in-group team (Packers).	1632704852.0	packers	49ers	212		1.0	0.760627031326294	0.23997871585668676

The sentences alternate between praising and criticizing different aspects of the team's performance, which is typical for a fan discussing their own team.  1. 'Defense plays well' - 'Defense' is tagged [IN] because the commenter would most likely be evaluating their own team's defense. 2. 'Offense plays like shit' - 'Offense' is tagged [IN] because the commenter is criticizing their own team's offense. 3. 'Offense plays well .... defense plays like shit' - Both 'Offense' and 'Defense' are tagged [IN] for the same reasons as above; the commenter is referring to different aspects of their own team’s performance. 4. 'I hate it' - This sentence expresses general frustration, likely directed at the overall performance of the in-group team without referring to it explicitly.  Therefore, 'Defense' and 'Offense' should be tagged as [IN] throughout the comment since they refer to the Raiders.	EXPLANATION: The comment consists of alternating statements about the defense and offense playing well or poorly, but without specifying which team. However, given the context where the in-group is the Raiders and the out-group is the Chargers, combined with the win probability of 24.8%, the commenter is likely referring to their own team (Raiders) when they mention the performance of the "Defense" and "Offense." Fans typically discuss their own team's performance in detail, especially when it is inconsistent or disappointing. Therefore, "Defense" and "Offense" in each sentence should be tagged [IN] because it's implied that the commenter is talking about the in-group team's units, reflecting their frustration. 'I hate it' is general dissatisfaction that correlates with the inconsistent performance mentioned earlier.	1670191903.0	raiders	chargers	519		1.0	0.248020350933075	0.24832932371023791

[SENT] [IN] needs help 	['[SENT]', 'Dude']	[(0, 6), (97, 101)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter's parent comment discusses "Justin" (likely Justin Fields, the quarterback for the Bears) and mentions the poor protection provided by his offensive line, indicating a focus on the in-group team, Bears. The first sentence in the comment addresses a hypothetical situation involving the team's strategy, implying a focus on the Bears' situation without expressly mentioning them, thus '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN]. The second sentence refers to "Dude" who "needs help," which, in context, is clearly referring to Justin Fields or another Bears player, hence is tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The parent comment indicates a discussion about Justin Fields, the quarterback for the Bears, who is the in-group team. Even though Justin is not explicitly mentioned in the main comment, the context from the parent comment makes it clear that the discussion is about him and his struggles with the offensive line. This is clearly a critique from a supporter perspective since it's speaking about the options he has in a dire situation ('throw it away and also not get the first down' indicates he's in a tough spot). Therefore, the first sentence is implicitly about the in-group team, and so '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence 'Dude needs help' also refers to Justin Fields needing assistance, hence 'Dude' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group player Justin Fields.	1671393459.0	bears	eagles	1110	Peanut Tillman	2.0	0.0381584167480469	0.6067405843013024

['KC']	[(49, 51)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is lamenting that the team is playing down to the competition, which is a critique typically levied at the team they support. In the second sentence, "KC special" is a sarcastic remark specific to Kansas City, which refers to the Chiefs (the in-group team). Therefore, "KC" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Chiefs).	The comment expresses frustration with the in-group team, the Chiefs, and their tendency to underperform against teams that are perceived as weaker or less competitive. The second sentence, "KC special," refers back to this pattern, labeling it as characteristic of the Chiefs. Since "KC" is shorthand for Kansas City, which refers to the Chiefs, it should be marked as [IN]. The high win probability indicates that despite overall game performance being satisfactory, the commenter is focusing on what they perceive as a recurring issue with the team. Thus, "[IN]" is the correct tag for "KC."	1643580812.0	chiefs	bengals	1111		4.0	0.805963829159737	0.6751526619076288

In this case, "we" refers to the Giants, the team that the commenter supports. Therefore, "we" should be tagged with [IN] since it directly refers to the in-group team. The sentence overall expresses hope for success, which is an expression of support for the in-group.	EXPLANATION: In this comment, 'we' is used to express the desire for a favorable outcome and is a common way fans refer to their own team. The use of 'we' clearly signifies that the commenter is talking about their in-group team, the Giants, as there is no mention of any other team. Furthermore, the context of hoping to score a lot of points aligns with wanting the in-group to perform well. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Giants.	1673820038.0	giants	vikings	1112		6.0	0.32667511701583896	0.056045812992865186

'they' is the out-group team throwing deep, 'Diggs' is a well-known player for the Bills, and 'McDermott' is the head coach of the Bills. Therefore, all these entities should be tagged as [OUT].	The commenter's team, the Jets, has a win probability of 0.0%, indicating that they are certain to lose against the Bills. The comment criticizes the actions of the opposing team (the Bills), notably targeting their head coach, Sean McDermott, and their wide receiver, Stefon Diggs.  - 'they' likely refers to the Bills, the out-group team, as it talks about the team throwing deep, which implies an offensive play by the opponent. - 'Diggs' is Stefon Diggs, a player for the out-group (Bills). - 'McDermott' is Sean McDermott, the head coach of the out-group (Bills).  Given the context and the critical tone towards the Bills, these entities are rightly tagged as referring to the out-group team. Thus, 'they', 'Diggs', and 'McDermott' are all tagged [OUT].	1636923688.0	jets	bills	1113		6.0	1.34706497192383e-05	0.8991603694374475

['Barkley', 'his', 'him']	[(7, 14), (103, 106), (130, 133)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The player "Barkley" is a key member of the in-group team, the Giants. The expression describes an in-group player facing injuries yearly, which signifies the discussant's familiarity and concern, typical of a fan's sentiment towards their own team players. Thus, "Barkley," as a direct reference to the in-group player, should be tagged [IN]. The pronouns "his" and "him" also refer back to Barkley, maintaining the in-group reference context. Therefore, "his" and "him" should also be tagged [IN] accordingly.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is frustrated with Saquon Barkley's recurring injuries. Barkley is a key player for the Giants, the in-group team, which accounts for the low win probability likely due to his absence impacting the game. 'Barkley' in the first sentence is tagged [IN] because it directly refers to an in-group player. In the third sentence, 'his contract' and 'him' both refer back to Barkley. The tags [IN] are appropriate for 'his' and 'him' because they are pronouns that replace Barkley's name, who is part of the in-group, the Giants. This frustration from the commenter implicitly signifies their support and concern for the in-group team.	1633899535.0	giants	cowboys	1114		5.0	0.15905660390853904	0.1731451822353043

Fans typically use "we" to collectively identify with their team. The context of the comment suggests disappointment in their performance, which aligns with how fans might criticize their own team. Therefore, "We" and "we" are tagged as [IN].	The commenter uses "We" in an unqualified manner, which typically indicates they are talking about their own team, the Texans—the in-group. The win probability is 0.0%, reflecting that the team is doing extremely poorly in the match and is essentially guaranteed to lose, which aligns with the sentiment expressed in the comment about being very bad. Both instances of "We" and "we" refer to the Texans, making the correct tags [IN].	1634499916.0	texans	colts	1115	:doodle17:	3.0	0.00017720460891701428	0.9216463702445011

Nick Bosa is a defensive player for the San Francisco 49ers. Since the commenter supports the 49ers and this comment is about a player from their in-group team, 'bosa' should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter expresses admiration for Bosa's celebration, and Nick Bosa is a well-known player for the 49ers, the in-group team. Given the high win probability, it indicates the 49ers are likely performing well, and the comment reflects a positive sentiment towards a player from the in-group. Therefore, 'bosa' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1670191170.0	49ers	dolphins	1117		12.0	0.723018765449524	0.2795523030563926

Since the in-group team is the Texans, "we'd" should be tagged with [IN] as it signifies the team supported by the commenter.	EXPLANATION: The comment is referring to the in-group team, the Texans, with the word "we'd," which is a contraction for "we would" and implicitly references the in-group team the commenter supports. Given the win probability is extremely low at 1.9%, it suggests the Texans are not doing well, and the comment humorously acknowledges that they would need to win to worry about future games. "[we'd]" should be tagged with [IN] since it is referring to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1672602375.0	texans	jaguars	1118	:ka:	2.0	0.0186726450920105	0.5983219211110039

The statement seems to express a thought regarding a mishap happening to Fuller, which is a detailed observation that fans usually make about their own team. Since 'Fuller' is a member of the in-group, the term should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: Fuller is a player for the Broncos, and the in-group team the commenter supports is the Broncos. The comment is reflective of the high win probability, signifying that the Broncos are likely doing well in the game. Therefore, "Fuller" should be tagged with [IN] since he refers to a player on the in-group team.	1638137000.0	broncos	chargers	436	TD Mile High Salute	1.0	0.729561507701874	0.31297365571995667

The commenter supports the Cowboys, and Wentz is a player for the Commanders, who are the out-group opponent in this context. Therefore, 'Wentz' should be tagged with [OUT] because he is an opponent player that the commenter is referring to.	EXPLANATION: Carson Wentz is a player for the Commanders, who are the out-group team in this context because the commenter is a Cowboys supporter. The phrase 'Gawd I love having Wentz back in the division' implies that the commenter appreciates playing against Wentz, likely due to perceived weaknesses or mistakes he makes that benefit the Cowboys. Since Wentz is a part of the Commanders, 'Wentz' should be tagged as [OUT] (referring to the out-group opponent). The high win probability for the in-group (Cowboys) further supports the positive sentiment about an out-group player being in the division, indicating potential ease of competition.	1664740543.0	cowboys	commanders	1119	Dallas Cowboys	2.0	0.995978883933276	0.9304324469513833

As the commenter supports the Chiefs, each instance of 'we' refers to the in-group team. Therefore, both 'We' and 'we' should be tagged [IN], reflecting that the statement is about the in-group team's performance and engagement during the game.	'We' and 'we' here clearly refer to the in-group, which is the Chiefs since the commenter is discussing the perceived attitude of their own team. The comment implies that the team (the Chiefs) needs more of a push (being significantly behind) to start putting in more effort. Therefore, both instances should be tagged with [IN] as they are referring to the in-group, the team the commenter supports.	1666557508.0	chiefs	49ers	1121	Patrick Mahomes II #15	4.0	0.436395525932312	0.06475468975468976
train	qoslm9	hjpgx79	t1_hjpgprj	[SENT] [IN] ? 	['Taylor']	[(7, 13)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 In this context, the name 'Taylor' is likely referring to a player on the in-group team (Patriots) given that the parent comment is discussing the team's running backs and expressing confidence in them. The name 'Taylor' could refer to a player like J.J. Taylor, who has been a part of the Patriots' running back group. As such, 'Taylor' is tagged with [IN] since the mention is about a player on the team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment is discussing the running backs, with the parent commenter implying they like all their options. The mention of 'Taylor' should be interpreted in that context and refers to a player on the Patriots roster, reinforcing the positive sentiment towards the backfield. Given the win probability is relatively high for the Patriots, it suggests they are doing well, which aligns with the positive tone of the comments. Therefore, 'Taylor' is referring to an in-group player and should be tagged [IN].	1636311328.0	patriots	panthers	1122		1.0	0.701634327339443	0.30379504827454357

['my team', 'Lawrence']	[(94, 101), (244, 252)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing frustration and embarrassment over their team's performance, indicating emotional investment typical of an in-group reference. Therefore, 'my team' should be tagged as [IN]. Additionally, 'Lawrence' refers to Trevor Lawrence, a player for the Jaguars (the in-group team), so it should also be tagged as [IN]. The phrasing does not indicate any reference to the opposing team or any other team, which further supports these tags.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Jaguars, and the out-group team is the Colts. In the comment, 'my team' clearly refers to the team that the commenter supports, which is the Jaguars, thus it should be tagged as [IN]. Additionally, Lawrence refers to Trevor Lawrence, who is the quarterback for the Jaguars, the in-group team, and therefore should also be tagged as [IN]. The win probability being 99.8% indicates that the Jaguars are almost certain to win, which aligns with the fact that the commenter is reflecting on looking forward ('... gotta deal with that going forward...') and focusing on their own team's performance and future dealings.	1641761629.0	jaguars	colts	1123	:IND:	2.0	0.997900128394365	0.9315565225274227
test	zudsm9	j1j4bmx	t1_j1j44lc	[IN] That was a perfect ball dude 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is likely disputing the parent comment's criticism regarding Mac Jones' throw, implicitly defending a player from the in-group (the Patriots). There are no explicit references to players or teams in the comment, yet the sentiment is defending an in-group player by stating the throw was perfect. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' because the comment is referring to an in-group player implicitly.	EXPLANATION: The context provided by the parent comment indicates that the discussion is centered around Mac, a player for the Patriots (the in-group team). Despite the critical tone of the parent comment regarding Mac's throw, the current comment is more lenient and offers a positive assessment of a subsequent play, stating that it was "a perfect ball." Given the extremely low win probability, the commenter’s shift to finding positives may indicate a focus on highlighting good moments even in a poor overall performance by their in-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN] since the comment indirectly praises an action by the in-group without explicitly mentioning any in-group entities.	1671911365.0	patriots	bengals	1124		0.0	0.0107211945578456	0.5350679676423985

['this', 'them']	[(12, 16), (90, 94)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is likely talking about the current game they are watching, so 'this' refers to the in-group team, which is the Raiders, making it tagged as [IN]. The term 'them' refers to the opposing team who is scoring quickly, which is the out-group, the 49ers, thus it is tagged as [OUT]. The context shows that the commenter is unhappy with their team's defense, indicating "we" refers to the in-group (Raiders), while "them" clearly refers to the opponent team (49ers) taking advantage.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is talking about the game involving the Raiders and the 49ers. The use of the word "we" without qualification typically refers to the in-group (Raiders) and indicates that the commenter is identifying with the Raiders. The phrase "letting them score" indicates that the opposing team (49ers) is making points, so "them" refers to the out-group. Thus, "this" in the context of setting up the overall statement and complaint is tagged [IN] due to implicit identification with the in-group (Raiders), and "them" is tagged [OUT] referring to the out-group (49ers).	1672614107.0	raiders	49ers	1125	:Millen:	1.0	0.487926340690508	0.5716157562853165

The use of "he" without specifying indicates it is probably a player from their own team (Eagles), especially since fans typically focus on their own team's players unless explicitly stating otherwise. Additionally, the neutral tone and subtle approval of the no-call (indicating a fair treatment in the commenter’s view) further suggest that the incident pertains to their own team rather than criticizing an opponent. Therefore, "he" and "his" should be tagged [IN].	The win probability is relatively low for the in-group (Eagles), indicating they may not be doing well at the moment. The comment appears to be discussing a specific play, where a player was hit early, leading to an incomplete pass. Given the absence of a parent comment providing additional context, the commenter seems to accept the non-call by the referees but believes the early contact influenced the play's outcome. Since there are no explicit references to either team in the comment, we rely on the implicit context. 'he' and 'his' are likely referring to an in-group player who was affected in the play being described. Typically, such discussions from fans focus on their own team's players and their experiences, especially when a controversial play occurs that could affect the game's outcome. Therefore, the entities 'he' and 'his' are tagged as [IN] since they implicitly refer to members of the in-group team, the Eagles.	1638133057.0	eagles	giants	1126		3.0	0.28221496939659096	0.9906959080983575

Since the comment is about JPP, it refers to the in-group team. Therefore, 'JPP' should be tagged with [IN] as it directly refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The high win probability of 82.4% indicates that the in-group, Buccaneers, is doing well. JPP (Jason Pierre-Paul) is a well-known player for the Buccaneers, so 'JPP' should be tagged [IN]. There are no other explicit entities mentioned in the comment, and given that the commenter is probably reacting to a perceived penalty missed by the referees, it reinforces that they are referring to an in-group player. Therefore, 'JPP' is correctly tagged as [IN] in this context.	1634258205.0	buccaneers	eagles	1127	:gronkflex:  Gronk	3.0	0.824421256780624	0.07997768064726123

'PACK' is a nickname for the Packers, thus it should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. The excitement and encouragement in the comment are clearly directed towards the Packers, indicating the commenter's support for their in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment "GO PACK GO!!!" is a cheer directed towards the in-group team supported by the commenter, which in this case is the Packers. The enthusiastic nature of the comment, combined with the use of the term "PACK," a common abbreviation for the Packers, indicates strong support for the in-group. Additionally, the high win probability suggests that the in-group team is performing well and is likely to win, making the expression of support logical. Thus, "PACK" should be tagged as [IN] since it references the in-group team.	1632190788.0	packers	lions	1129	:GB:	1.0	0.916821539402008	0.7123274631128034
test	rp9sqm	hq3fqpv	t1_hq3fn0h	[IN] Yeah The Suicide Squad sounds good 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is referring to an in-group fan's attempt to disengage from the sports event (likely due to disappointment or frustration) and focus on something else like watching a movie. The implicit sentiment expressed is dissatisfaction with the in-group team's performance, as they are choosing to watch a movie instead. Since there is no specific word or phrase that refers directly to the in-group, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' to indicate that the comment pertains to the in-group team's situation, even though it is expressed through a desire to watch a movie.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is Commanders, and the win probability is very low, indicating they are likely losing. The parent comment suggests giving up on the game to watch a movie instead, which implies dissatisfaction with the game's outcome. The comment itself, although talking about a movie (The Suicide Squad), reflects a lack of interest in continuing to watch the game. Hence, it implicitly refers to the in-group's situation and overall discouragement with their performance. '[SENT]' captures this implicit reference to the in-group, and thus it should be tagged with [IN].	1640569968.0	commanders	cowboys	399		1.0	0.04755089411018898	0.1638243831640058

['Matt Ryan']	[(7, 16)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment is discussing Matt Ryan, who is a player for the Falcons. Since Ryan is a member of the out-group team, the reference to him should be tagged with [OUT]. There are no other explicit mentions of teams or players that would need tagging. The second sentence is a general question and does not refer to any team specifically. Thus, 'Matt Ryan' is tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: Matt Ryan is the quarterback for the Falcons, who are the out-group team for the commenter supporting the Patriots. The win probability for the Patriots is very high, suggesting they are winning comfortably, which explains why the comment seems more observational rather than critical. 'Matt Ryan' is therefore correctly tagged as [OUT] because he is a player for the opponent team. Since there's no other specific references, only 'Matt Ryan' needs to be tagged as [OUT].	1637290712.0	patriots	falcons	1130		2.0	0.9592602625489235	0.5656675211989746

The phrase "Rodgers sucks" is a derogatory remark directed towards this out-group player, indicating dislike or criticism. Therefore, 'Rodgers' should be tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the 49ers, and they are playing against the Packers. Mention of "Rodgers" refers to Aaron Rodgers, who is the quarterback for the Packers, making him an out-group player. With a low win probability for the 49ers (23.3%), it is more likely the commenter is frustrated or mocking the out-group team/player. Therefore, "Rodgers" should be tagged as [OUT] since it references an out-group player.	1642906407.0	49ers	packers	1131		13.0	0.23292542994022403	0.5657424403439282

Since the comment is enthusiastic about Perine making touchdown receptions, it reflects support for the in-group team. Therefore, "PERINE" should be tagged [IN] as it denotes a player from the in-group, aligning with the commenter's support.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is excitedly celebrating a successful reception touchdown (TD) by a player named Perine. Given that Perine is a player on the Bengals, which is the in-group team for the commenter, Perine should therefore be tagged as [IN] in this context. The high win probability of 73.6% for the Bengals further supports the idea that the commenter is celebrating a positive play made by their in-group team. Thus, “PERINE” is correctly tagged as [IN].	1668983006.0	bengals	steelers	1132	 	5.0	0.735657095909119	0.2942069314444726

['DJ', 'Saquon', 'We']	[(7, 9), (30, 36), (57, 59)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter is clearly expressing enthusiasm and support for players on their team, indicating that 'DJ' (Daniel Jones) and 'Saquon' (Saquon Barkley) are both crucial members of the in-group (Giants). Additionally, 'We' typically refers to the team the commenter supports, making it an in-group reference as well. Therefore, DJ, Saquon, and We should all be tagged as [IN], reflecting their association with the Giants.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing players from the in-group (Giants). 'DJ' refers to Daniel Jones and 'Saquon' refers to Saquon Barkley, both notable players on the Giants. The third sentence uses 'We', which is a common way for fans to refer to their own team, the in-group team. Given the low win probability, it makes sense that the commenter is focusing on star players and rallying behind their team. Thus, all terms 'DJ', 'Saquon', and 'We' should be tagged with [IN].	1671915443.0	giants	vikings	1133		6.0	0.221614328593016	0.9534460811056555

['the D', 'them', 'them']	[(13, 18), (30, 34), (76, 80)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter is primarily discussing the performance of the defense, which is referred to with the abbreviation 'D'. In the context of a sports comment, the use of 'the D' without additional specification typically refers to the in-group defense. The phrase "has gotten them the ball" suggests that the defense has been effective in securing possession, which again points to a positive evaluation of the in-group. The pronoun 'them' also refers back to the in-group since it follows 'the D.' The phrase "it won’t be on them" implies that the defense will not be blamed if the game is lost, which solidifies that 'them' is referring to the in-group defense. Therefore, 'the D', and both instances of 'them' should be tagged as [IN], as they all refer to the in-group team, the Steelers.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the Steelers (in-group) is fairly low, indicating they might be struggling in the game. The commenter is discussing how the defense (commonly abbreviated as 'the D') has gotten the ball for their team (the in-group) multiple times during the half. The phrase 'it won't be on them' implies that if there is any fault, it should not be placed on the defense ('the D') for the in-group team. 'the D' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers specifically to the Steelers’ defense, and 'them' in both instances points back to the defense of the in-group, hence tagged with [IN] as well.	1666580337.0	steelers	dolphins	1134		1.0	0.16334341466426805	0.8663440059568132

['Bills', 'Vikings', 'Cardinals']	[(127, 132), (135, 142), (177, 186)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 This comment primarily talks about enjoying football games. The in-group team for the commenter is the Cardinals, while the out-group team is the Rams. The mention of "Bills" and "Vikings" refers to another game that is not involving the in-group or out-group team, so these should be tagged as [OTHER]. The in-group team is explicitly mentioned as the "Cardinals", which should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a fan of the Cardinals, as indicated by their in-group team. In the last sentence, they mention watching the Cardinals game, which directly references their in-group team and hence should be tagged [IN]. The mention of the "Bills / Vikings game" refers to a game between two other teams in the NFL, neither of which are the in-group (Cardinals) or the out-group (Rams). Therefore, "Bills" and "Vikings" should be tagged as [OTHER]. The first two sentences do not contain any references that need tagging as they are general statements about the enjoyment of the game.	1668375714.0	cardinals	rams	1135	:wolf: Wolf	6.0	0.395660638809204	0.08447170337329245

The mention of "the Eagles" refers to the out-group opponent team and should be tagged as [OUT]. The context suggests the commenter believes the referees are biased in favor of the Eagles, which aligns with the out-group designation here. The parent comment also supports this as it mentions the Eagles receiving favorable decisions.	The term "ref Union" refers to the league's officials, who are neither part of the in-group nor out-group but are considered a neutral third party, thus they should be tagged as [OTHER]. The commenter sarcastically suggests the referees are biased towards the Eagles by mentioning they might have money on them, which implies favoritism towards the out-group team. Therefore, "the Eagles" should be tagged with [OUT], as it clearly denotes the out-group opponent. This is consistent with the parent comment, which also implies favoritism towards the Eagles by discussing penalties that benefitted them.	1675027848.0	49ers	eagles	1136	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	1.0	0.26347026597700296	0.46952284637308084

Given the context and the previous mention of Brandon Marshall as a past player, it is reasonable to infer that 'B Marsh' denotes the same in-group player. Thus, 'B Marsh' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment 'God I miss B Marsh' references Brandon Marshall, a former player for the Jets, the in-group team for the commenter. The parent comment indicates that the commenter considers Brandon Marshall to have been the best receiver the Jets had acquired in recent times. Given that the sentiment is nostalgic and the player is referred to positively, it further confirms that 'B Marsh' should be tagged as [IN] since it references a former player of the in-group team, the Jets. The very low win probability suggests the commenter is reflecting on better times for the team.	1671767600.0	jets	jaguars	1138	:OtherRevisIsland: Revis Island	1.0	0.0044603943824768	0.9105242793577094

Since the Vikings are neither the team the commenter supports nor their opponent, they fall into the category of other teams in the NFL. Therefore, "Vikings" should be tagged with [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: The comment is about the Vikings, who are a team that is neither the in-group (Seahawks) nor the out-group (Jets) for the commenter. Therefore, ‘Vikings’ should be tagged as [OTHER] since it refers to another team in the NFL that is not directly involved in the game being discussed. The win probability of 79.8% suggests that the in-group (Seahawks) is doing well, but the comment about the “Vikings” is unrelated to the immediate game context and focuses on a different team’s performance.	1672612409.0	seahawks	jets	1139	:sea1:​	2.0	0.797588810324669	0.4778977943178724

Hence, '[SENT]' in the first and third sentences should be tagged as [OTHER]. 'Shaq' refers to a player of the in-group team (Buccaneers), so it should be tagged as [IN]. The use of 'they' in "what do they expect defenders to do?" refers to the officials, not the teams, so it is tagged as [OTHER]. The fourth sentence also criticizes the officiating without reference to either team, so it is tagged as [OTHER]. Finally, 'we' and '[SENT]' in the fifth sentence refer to the in-group team, showing optimism about their position, and should be tagged as [IN]. The phrase "Let’s finish this!" also reflects in-group support and is tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commentator is discussing a controversial "offsides" penalty and poor officiating, expressing frustration typically expected from someone supporting a specific team. The sentences without explicit references ('[SENT]') generally indicate frustration towards the penalty calls or the game situation, and could thus be referring to the officiating or general game situation [OTHER].  In the second sentence, "Shaq" is likely referring to Shaquil Barrett, a known player for the Buccaneers, hence tagged as [IN]. The "snap count" and "perfect jump" discussion (third sentence) is tied to the defense which Shaq is part of, so tagging "they" [OTHER] suggests a commentary on what referees (neutral officiating body) expect defenders to do.  The sentence discussing "ruling that fumble a incomplete pass" criticizes officiating again, hence tagged with [OTHER] as it refers to officials.   The fifth sentence uses "we," indicating reference to the in-group Buccaneers, reflecting on their favorable situation going into the half, tagged as [IN]. Similarly, the final sentence "Let 's finish this!" conveys a rallying cry to the in-group team, so it's tagged with [IN].	1632087690.0	buccaneers	falcons	1140		18.0	0.947370626032352	0.5072986282096377

'49s' is a shorthand for the 49ers, and since it is the team the commenter sees as the opponent or out-group, it is tagged [OUT]. The other parts of the comment express annoyance but do not mention additional specific entities, so no further tagging is required. The first sentence refers directly to the out-group team, while the second sentence provides a general sentiment towards the situation, hence '49s' is the correct tagged referring expression with [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The word '49s' refers to the 49ers, which is the out-group opponent team in this context. The commenters are complaining about the broadcasters or commentators talking too much about the opposing team, which implies annoyance or frustration directed towards the out-group team (49ers). Since there's no other explicit reference to entities in the second sentence, it does not need any specific tagging except the [SENT] separator. Therefore, '49s' should be tagged [OUT] to reflect that it refers to the opponent team. The win probability for the in-group (Packers) is relatively high at 67.8%, but this comment is about the emphasis commentators are placing on the out-group, regardless of the game situation.	1642904962.0	packers	49ers	1142	:AronJone:	3.0	0.678379625082016	0.4261424017003188

[IN] very dumb play man 	['Huntley', '[SENT]']	[(47, 54), (57, 63)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The comment is criticizing a play made by Huntley, who is a player for the Ravens, the in-group team supported by the commenter. Therefore, 'Huntley' should be tagged with [IN]. In the second sentence, the commenter is still referring to the same play made by Huntley, expressing frustration (indicated by "very dumb play man"). Since there is no explicit mention of Huntley again, the [SENT] token should be tagged with [IN] as well, as it implicitly continues to refer to the in-group player’s action.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Ravens, and Tyler Huntley is a quarterback for the Ravens. Therefore, 'Huntley' in the first sentence should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player on the in-group team the commenter supports. The win probability is low, which indicates that the Ravens are not doing well, and the comment is negative about a play. As there is likely an implicit criticism of the in-group team in the second sentence, '[SENT]' is tagged [IN] due to the direct criticism of the 'dumb play', even though no specific player or team is mentioned. The context implies that the commented play belongs to the in-group based on the preceding sentence.	1673840792.0	ravens	bengals	1143		5.0	0.084564208984375	0.8308526277104006

['their']	[(21, 26)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter is a Dolphins fan and is likely referring to a favorable outcome for their team due to the opponent's mistakes. "Their" refers to the out-group (Lions) since the lack of discipline is attributed to them. Since the comment implies that the in-group (Dolphins) benefited from this lack of discipline, 'their' should be tagged [OUT], indicating it refers to the opponent.	EXPLANATION: The comment "Bailed out by their lack of discipline but I 'll take it" is reflecting on a situation where the commenter feels their in-group team, the Dolphins, benefited from a mistake made by the out-group team, the Lions. Since the commenter says "I'll take it," it implies they are a supporter of the Dolphins. The referring expression "their" points to the Lions (out-group), who lack discipline. Thus, "their" should be tagged as [OUT] to indicate the out-group.	1667151300.0	dolphins	lions	1146		3.0	0.4295903606122	0.190850959173635

Zappe is a quarterback for the New England Patriots, hence he should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team with respect to the commenter. The sentence does not have an explicit mention of the opposing team (Packers), so no part of it is tagged as [OUT]. The overall tone of the comment reflects surprise or frustration, which aligns with how a fan might react to their own team's performance in a high-stress situation like going into overtime.	EXPLANATION: 'We' almost always refers to the in-group, in this case the Patriots. Zappe is a player for the Patriots, the in-group team the commenter supports. Despite the low win probability, the comment is reflecting on the in-group's current situation of potentially going into overtime. Therefore, the sentence '[SENT]' implicitly refers to the in-group, and 'Zappe' should be tagged as [IN] since he is part of the in-group team.	1664753196.0	patriots	packers	1148		14.0	0.325035035610199	0.9003726708074534

['JJ']	[(12, 14)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The referring expression 'JJ' is a widely recognized nickname for Justin Jefferson, a player for the Minnesota Vikings, making him part of the in-group. The overall context of the comment suggests that it is about a specific play where an in-group player was held. Since 'JJ' is related to the in-group player, it should be tagged with [IN]. The phrase 'held again' further emphasizes a recurring situation faced by the in-group, supporting the sentiment that the comment is focusing on an in-group player, justifying the tag of [IN]. No additional explicit in-group or out-group references are present in the second sentence, so no further tagging is necessary.	The comment is discussing how 'JJ,' who is a notable player for the Vikings (often referring to Justin Jefferson), was held during a play. The phrasing indicates that 'JJ' is being prevented from performing well by the opponent, not by his own team. The win probability suggests a close game, where every play could be critical. The exclamation 'Held JJ again!' shows frustration typically expressed by fans when their own players are hindered, thus 'JJ' (Justin Jefferson) should be tagged with [IN], as he belongs to the in-group team. The second sentence 'That jersey tug!' is further clarifying and adding emphasis to the holding offense against their player, without specifying whom 'That jersey tug' refers to explicitly. Therefore, in the absence of explicit mentions, the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group team (Vikings).	1668373525.0	vikings	bills	1149	84	2.0	0.544145405292511	0.81198163507109

Simmons is a player for the Cardinals, the in-group team the commenter supports. Since the comment shows positive sentiment towards Simmons, it is reasonable to tag 'Simmons' with [IN], as he is part of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: While the win probability for the in-group Cardinals is relatively low, the comment expresses a positive sentiment about 'Simmons' rushing the quarterback (QB). Simmons is an in-group player for the Cardinals, thus the positive sentiment 'Love' suggests the commenter is pleased with the performance of their own team member. Therefore, 'Simmons' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	1667158698.0	cardinals	vikings	1151	:old: Cardinals Throwback	3.0	0.380475074052811	0.75809199318569

The commenter explains how Zac, presumably Zac Taylor, the head coach of the Bengals, handles play-calling and how Joe, presumably Joe Burrow, the Bengals' quarterback, executes these plays. The responsibilities and decisions being described pertain to in-group members' actions during the game, thus referring to their team strategies. Each instance of 'Zac', 'Joe', 'he', and 'his' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to the coach and the player from the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The comment mentions specific players and roles within the in-group team, Bengals, specifically Zac and Joe who are known to be associated with the Bengals. The commenter discusses Zac’s control over play-calling and Joe’s role, demonstrating coordination and expectation within the team. 'Zac' is referred to as the play-caller, indicating an in-group coach or coordinator role, and 'Joe' is repeatedly mentioned as the player executing or being given instructions (presumably Joe Burrow, the Bengals’ quarterback). Thus, 'Zac' and 'Joe' should both be tagged as [IN] because they are associated with the in-group team. The pronouns 'he' and 'his' in the second and third sentences also refer to Zac and Joe, respectively, reinforcing their association with the in-group. Therefore, these expressions are tagged [IN] due to their direct connection to the in-group team according to the commenter’s perspective.	1638733865.0	bengals	chargers	1152		1.0	0.215121820569038	0.5450213192876849

train	q0kquq	hf9a9ow	t3_q0kquq	[IN] Such a shit playcall 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is criticizing a play call, which fans usually do for their own team since they are more invested in the in-group's decisions and performance. Since there is no explicit word or phrase that refers directly to the in-group or out-group team, the entire sentence is tagged with [IN] to indicate that the criticism is implicitly directed at the in-group team, the Vikings.	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing frustration with the playcall, which likely comes from the team the commenter supports, especially when no team is explicitly mentioned. The win probability of 31.0% indicates that the in-group team (Vikings) is losing, which aligns with the negative sentiment in the comment. Thus, the comment should be tagged [IN] as it is implicitly criticizing the in-group team's playcall. '[SENT]' is tagged because there is no explicit word/phrase referring to the in-group, but the sentence is directed at the in-group team.	1633287064.0	vikings	browns	1154	THIS IS NOT DETROIT MAN THIS IS THE SUPERBOWL	2.0	0.309620499610901	0.5752844667901561

['Action Jackson']	[(7, 21)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The reference "Action Jackson" is a nickname commonly used for Lamar Jackson, who is the quarterback for the Ravens. Given that the in-group team the commenter supports is the Ravens, "Action Jackson" is a celebration of a player from the in-group team. Therefore, "Action Jackson" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group entity. The enthusiasm in the comment further supports that it is meant positively towards an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The comment "Action Jackson !!" is likely cheering on a player known as Jackson, which refers to Lamar Jackson, the quarterback for the Ravens, and the in-group team the commenter supports. The win probability is high, indicating that the Ravens are doing well, which aligns with the enthusiastic punctuation. Thus, "Action Jackson" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a key player of the in-group team.	1632677905.0	ravens	lions	1155	 :CAKEBIRD:	2.0	0.750457763671875	0.19203873050026896

['Chicago']	[(25, 32)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The parent comment is comparing the commenter’s team (Steelers) to Chicago, indicating that they believe their team is slightly better. In the NFL, Chicago refers to the Chicago Bears, which are neither the in-group (Steelers) nor the out-group (Jets) in this context. Therefore, 'Chicago' should be tagged [OTHER]. The comment itself does not explicitly mention Steelers or Jets but is about the Steelers' ranking, hence "we" implicitly refers to the in-group team, but as there's no explicit mention, these sentences themselves are not tagged directly. Thus, 'Chicago' is tagged as [OTHER], and in "Ranked 31st," there's no additional mention, so no further tagging is required.	The in-group team is the Steelers, and the out-group is the Jets. The parent comment mentions Chicago, which is neither the in-group nor the out-group, thus referring to another team in the NFL. The low win probability suggests the Steelers are not doing well, and the commenter is comparing their team to another poorly performing team, Chicago, to highlight their situation. 'We' refers to the in-group, but 'Chicago' is an [OTHER] team in the NFL since it is neither the Steelers (in-group) nor the Jets (out-group). Thus 'Chicago' should be tagged [OTHER]. The sentence 'Ranked 31st' implicitly refers to the Steelers' ranking, and there is no explicit entity to tag. Therefore, the correct tagged output and referring expressions are as provided.	1664732630.0	steelers	jets	1156		1.0	0.253306250486247	0.2165532879818594

Fans often use "we" to refer to their own team when expressing frustration or critique, which in this case, is about the refusal to blitz. Therefore, "we" should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The usage of "we" typically means the commenter is talking about the team they support, which in this case is the in-group, the Bears. Given the low win probability for the Bears, it suggests frustration from the commenter about the lack of aggressive defensive strategies such as blitzing. Therefore, "we" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team.	1667764985.0	bears	dolphins	566	Smokin' Jay	4.0	0.109118105417954	0.6697102394484301

The name 'Ulbrich' refers to Jeff Ulbrich, the Jets' defensive coordinator, which is a role within the in-group team structure. Therefore, 'Ulbrich' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a key member of the in-group (Jets).	EXPLANATION: The comment is criticizing the play calls as being a 'trash fire' and mentions 'Ulbrich', who is Jeff Ulbrich, the defensive coordinator for the Jets, the in-group team. The extremely low win probability indicates the in-group (Jets) is performing poorly, which aligns with the disparaging tone of the comment. Therefore, 'Ulbrich' should be tagged [IN] since he is a member of the in-group, the Jets.	1664132666.0	jets	bengals	1157	:nj20:	6.0	0.026756768295676	0.628298805123356

They are not associated with either the in-group or out-group team. Therefore, 'Refs' is tagged as [OTHER] since they belong to neither the Bears (in-group) nor the Texans (out-group). The comment suggests an expectation of a call from the referees, who are an independent entity and thus classified as [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: The term 'Refs' refers to the referees who officiate the game, and they are neutral entities who do not belong to either the in-group or out-group teams. Therefore, 'Refs' should be tagged as [OTHER] since it refers to a distinct group that is not part of either the Bears (in-group) or Texans (out-group). The win probability indicates that the Bears are currently doing well, but the comment about the referees (Refs) making a call is independent of the current game state and focuses on the actions of an impartial officiating group.	1664134402.0	bears	texans	705	Blowup	1.0	0.643944203853607	0.8575355450236967

The comment suggests that the team, referred to as 'Pats', is unfairly being deprived of having a good punter by some external force ('Football gods'), implying dissatisfaction with the situation related to their own team. Thus, 'Pats' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	The term 'Pats' is a colloquial abbreviation for 'Patriots,' the in-group team the commenter supports. Despite the relatively low win probability, which indicates the in-group might not be performing well, the comment is focused on the in-group's punter situation. Since the commenter is lamenting the state of the Patriots' punter by mentioning that the 'Football gods decided [Pats] are not allowed to have a good punter,' the term 'Pats' should be tagged as [IN]. Therefore, 'Pats' is the correct referring expression tagged with [IN]. The entire sentence implicitly concerns the in-group's struggles, confirming the appropriate tagging.	1669340938.0	patriots	vikings	1158		4.0	0.44079494476318404	0.14025127966496045

When the commenter expresses enthusiasm about Carr having an MVP season, it implies a positive outlook towards a key player on their team. Thus, 'CARR' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is referring to Derek Carr, who is the quarterback for the Raiders, which is the in-group team. Given that they are positive about an MVP season for him and the win probability is high, it indicates optimism about the team's performance. Therefore, 'CARR' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group team the commenter supports. The sentence '[SENT]' does not need an explicit tag since the mention of 'CARR' is adequately tagged and reflects the in-group sentiment.	1632080408.0	raiders	steelers	1159		9.0	0.836622064920659	0.8413940256045519

The phrase 'LFG' is an acronym for "Let's F***ing Go," a cheer that a fan would use to show support and excitement for their own team. Since 'D-Mac' is referring to an in-group player and the context is a cheer for the in-group, 'D-Mac' should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: 'D-Mac' is a common nickname for Devin McCourty, who is a well-known player for the New England Patriots. Given that the commenter supports the Patriots, and the win probability is very high for the in-group, it suggests that the commenter is excited and cheering for a pivotal play or strong performance by Devin McCourty. Therefore, 'D-Mac' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team, the Patriots. The acronym 'LFG' (Let’s Fucking Go) further reinforces the excitement and support for the in-group.	1667157913.0	patriots	jets	1160		2.0	0.867162570357323	0.7923760177646189

The use of "we" suggests the commenter is referring to their own team, the in-group (Eagles), so "we" should be tagged [IN]. "Hurts" is a player on the Eagles, so "hurts" should also be tagged [IN]. This aligns the entities with the appropriate in-group and out-group designations based on the context within the comment.	EXPLANATION: The comment discusses a specific sequence of plays in the game, describing how the Chargers (the out-group) blitzed on two consecutive third downs. The commenter then talks about how "we" (the in-group Eagles) failed to block, allowing Hurts (a player on the Eagles) to escape. The word "chargers" refers to the out-group and should be tagged [OUT]. The pronoun "we" and the name "hurts" clearly refer to the in-group, since the commenter is an Eagles supporter and Jalen Hurts is a player for the Eagles. Therefore, they should be tagged with [IN]. The win probability is relatively low for the in-group, which is consistent with the comment's focus on a problematic situation for the Eagles, reinforcing the tags used.	1636327638.0	eagles	chargers	1161		5.0	0.20112444460392	0.8539596507076181

Glennon is indeed a player for the Giants, making this a comment from a Giants fan criticizing their own quarterback. Therefore, "Glennon" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is disparaging Mike Glennon, who is a quarterback for the Giants, the in-group team. Despite the fact that the win probability is low and it might make sense to criticize an opponent, the use of Glennon's last name without any qualification strongly indicates that he is a known entity within the in-group. It is common for fans to vent frustrations about their own team under such circumstances, especially given the poor win probability. Hence, 'Glennon' should be tagged with [IN].	1639938776.0	giants	cowboys	1162		12.0	0.162224113941193	0.16609153650563022

The mention of him playing a specific position indicates a focus on in-group dynamics and player assignments, which is typical for a supporter discussing their own team. Therefore, 'CJGJ' should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to a player from the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: With an extremely high win probability of 98.8%, it's clear the in-group team (Eagles) is performing well in this game against the out-group (Giants). CJGJ refers to C.J. Gardner-Johnson, a player for the Philadelphia Eagles. The commenter is discussing a positive aspect of the team's strategy, noting that having CJGJ play nickle corner is a luxury, which suggests they are highlighting a strategic advantage or strength of the in-group team. Therefore, 'CJGJ' should be tagged with [IN] as it clearly refers to an in-group player.	1673222327.0	eagles	giants	129		2.0	0.988236010074615	0.8693923906871096

EXPLANATION: The commenter is talking about Fields, who is a player on the in-group team, the Bears. The phrase "3 mins left in the first" is providing context for the performance of Fields, indicating an early and significant achievement. 'Fields' is the player being referred to and should be tagged [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports. The sentence "Unreal" likely expresses amazement or admiration for Fields' performance, further pointing towards a positive highlight for the in-group. The win probability being slightly less than 50% suggests the game is competitive, making such a performance even more notable. Therefore, 'Fields' in the first sentence is correctly tagged [IN], and there is no inappropriately tagged entity in the second sentence.	1672597900.0	bears	lions	239		10.0	0.455188453197479	0.16793014106131848

['Russell Wilson', 'Cris Collinsworth']	[(128, 142), (147, 164)]	['[OUT]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter mentions Russell Wilson and Cris Collinsworth in a light-hearted or sarcastic manner. Russell Wilson is a player for the Broncos, the out-group team, so he should be tagged [OUT]. Cris Collinsworth, however, is neither a player nor directly associated with the Broncos; he is a broadcaster who used to play for the Bengals, which makes him an [OTHER] entity. Thus, 'Russell Wilson' is tagged [OUT] and 'Cris Collinsworth' is tagged [OTHER], as they accurately refer to entities outside the in-group supported by the commenter.	EXPLANATION: Russell Wilson is the quarterback for the Denver Broncos, the opponent team in this context, so he should be tagged [OUT]. Cris Collinsworth, on the other hand, is a sports commentator and former player who is not associated with either the in-group or out-group teams, hence he should be tagged [OTHER]. The conversation does not explicitly mention the in-group team, the 49ers, and the questions posed are about specific individuals outside of in-game context. Therefore, the tags for Russell Wilson and Cris Collinsworth appropriately reflect their in-group and other-group affiliations respectively.	1664161941.0	49ers	broncos	1165	:harbaughkhakis: Jim Harbaugh	10.0	0.42704686589539	0.9180638182801514
train	qtu2m9	hkmfd4q	t3_qtu2m9	[IN] Literally no one came to play 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses frustration about the performance of a team without specifying which team. Since the commenter is a Falcons supporter, it is reasonable to assume that the frustration is directed towards the in-group team (Falcons). Therefore, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group's poor performance, and '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	EXPLANATION: The win probability is extremely low, indicating the Falcons are performing poorly. The comment is expressing frustration about a lack of effort or performance, which a fan would direct towards their own team. Since there is no specific entity mentioned, the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group (Falcons). Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as the sentiment is clearly about the in-group.	1636917187.0	falcons	cowboys	1166		5.0	0.010082304477691983	0.404328343979407

['Crosby']	[(20, 26)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter mentions 'Crosby' and expresses a personal sentiment towards him, usually indicating a player from the team they support. Given that the in-group is the Packers and Mason Crosby is a well-known player (kicker) for the Packers, 'Crosby' should be tagged as [IN]. The use of the term 'we' further emphasizes that the commenter is referring to someone from the in-group. Therefore, tagging 'Crosby' with [IN] is appropriate here.	EXPLANATION: Crosby refers to Mason Crosby, who is a player for the Packers, the in-group team. The commenter mentions 'we' when asking when to let him go, which suggests they are speaking as a fan of the Packers. Even though the win probability is above 50%, implying the in-group might be doing well, the comment seems to focus on a particular player's performance or career situation, common in sports discussions. Thus 'Crosby' should be tagged [IN] since he is part of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1636925532.0	packers	seahawks	1167	:RetroLogo:	6.0	0.593464493751526	0.03749085588880761

The phrase 'our luck' also indicates that the commenter is talking about their own team's strategy. Additionally, 'the run D' refers to the in-group's defense against the run, another indication the commenter is discussing the performance of their own team. Therefore, 'we' (both in "keep pushing our luck" and "we’re gonna lose eventually") and 'the run D' should all be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment discusses concerns about the in-group team's (Cardinals) run defense (run D) potentially leading to a loss. The use of "we" indicates the commenter identifies with the team (Cardinals), making "we" tagged as [IN] in both instances. The phrase "the run D" is referring to the in-group's defense, which should also be tagged [IN] since it is the team's run defense under discussion. The high win probability suggests the in-group is currently doing well, but the commenter is worried about their performance in defending against the run which could lead to losing in the future. Therefore, 'we', 'run D', and 'we' are all correctly tagged as [IN] as they refer to the commenter’s team.	1633900445.0	cardinals	49ers	26		1.0	0.791666880249977	0.2670517051705171
train	zcjzg8	iyxoxd5	t3_zcjzg8	[SENT] That ’s [OUT] ✌🏻interceptions 	['tua']	[(15, 18)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment refers to Tua Tagovailoa, a player for the Dolphins, who are the out-group team in this context. Since the comment mentions an out-group player's negative performance (interceptions), it is likely intended to criticize or make light of the opponent. Therefore, 'tua' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to an out-group player.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the 49ers, and they are playing against the Dolphins. Mention of 'Tua' refers to Tua Tagovailoa, who is the quarterback for the Dolphins, the out-group team in this context. Since the comment references Tua's interceptions, it is logically about the out-group team, as supporters often note opponent errors. Additionally, with a high win probability for the in-group, it is likely the commenter is emphasizing the mistakes made by Tua, the opponent. Hence, 'Tua' should be tagged as [OUT].	1670196164.0	49ers	dolphins	1168		1.0	0.938551187515259	0.7095135600516573

Therefore, 'Schlottman' should be tagged [IN] since he is a player for the Broncos, which is the commenter's supported team. Additionally, 'this team' indicates the same in-group, as it refers to the team the commenter supports (the Broncos), and thus should also be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing frustration and questioning why a certain player, Schlottman, is still part of the team the commenter supports. Since the in-group is the Broncos, and the win probability is very low (indicating that the in-group is likely performing poorly), it's reasonable the commenter is frustrated with their own team. Therefore, 'Schlottman' is tagged [IN] because he is a player on the in-group team, and 'this team' is also tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, the Broncos.	1641165595.0	broncos	chargers	1170	:full_bronco:	2.0	0.014932951889932045	0.7894479248238058
train	rz9r3e	hru0mxp	t3_rz9r3e	[SENT] Where the fuck has [IN] been ? 	['this guy']	[(26, 34)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is likely referring to a player from the in-group (Broncos) who has suddenly made a noticeable impact in the game, prompting the commenter to question where this player's performance has been previously. The phrase "this guy" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player whose performance the commenter is commenting on. A supporter would more likely lament the absence or sudden presence of a crucial play or player from their own team rather than an opponent.	EXPLANATION: The comment, "Where the fuck has this guy been?", is likely a frustrated inquiry about the performance or presence of a player on the in-group team, which is the Broncos. The relatively low win probability suggests that the Broncos are not doing well, which could lead to such frustration from a supporter. The term "this guy" without more context usually refers to a player on the commenter’s own team (in-group) unless specified otherwise. Therefore, "this guy" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to an in-group player whose absence or lack of impact is being questioned.	1641680373.0	broncos	chiefs	1171		3.0	0.35052340075699	0.27535416080307723
train	ps6530	hdo522b	t1_hdo50hz	[SENT] Is [OTHER] gonna suit up ? 	['he']	[(10, 12)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The parent comment mentions wanting Teryl Austin back, who is a coach. The follow-up comment asks if "he" is gonna suit up, usually implying a player or an individual key to the team. The in-group is the Lions and the out-group is the Packers, but the context suggests that the commenter is likely referring to another player or coach not currently associated with either team, hence the use of [OTHER] for "he".	EXPLANATION: The parent comment is about wanting Teryl Austin, a former coach of the Lions and now with another team, back. Given the context, 'he' likely refers to Teryl Austin, who is not associated with the current teams playing (Lions and Packers). Thus, 'he' should be tagged as [OTHER], as the comment is referring to someone outside the in-group and out-group teams. The win probability is very low for the Lions, but this doesn't affect the tagging since the mention of 'he' is independent of the game's current state.	1632190558.0	lions	packers	1172	I wanna die	1.0	0.10766524076461803	0.6904331270823417

The reference to a specific event involving an in-group player implies a familiarity with or interest in that player's actions, typical of a supporter. Therefore, "the G*no fumble" should be tagged with [IN] since it pertains to the in-group team. The rest of the comment does not specifically mention any entities, so only "the G*no fumble" is tagged.	EXPLANATION: The term "G*no" refers to Geno Smith, who is the quarterback for the Seahawks, the in-group team the commenter supports. Given the win probability is very low (3.0%), it indicates that the Seahawks are likely struggling in the game. The commenter is making a reference to a fumble by Geno Smith, likely a critical mistake, which is derisively termed "the G*no fumble." This reference highlights frustration or criticism towards the in-group player's performance. Therefore, "the G*no fumble" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to a specific player on the in-group team.	1673740376.0	seahawks	49ers	1173		3.0	0.029781036078930012	0.7736109831383028

['he']	[(75, 77)]	['[OUT]']	[3]	 The previous comment indicates frustration with the performance of the Eagles' player ("he's own us all fucking day"). In the follow-up comment, the phrase "he's a little bitch for that" is directed towards the same player, continuing the sentiment from the parent comment where "he" refers to an out-group player (Eagles). Therefore, "he" should be correctly tagged as [OUT] since the commenter is expressing a negative opinion about an opponent player.	The context provided by the parent comment indicates that "he" refers to an opposing player who has been performing very well against the in-group team (Steelers). The out-group team, Eagles, is dominating, as reflected by the low win probability for the in-group. In the reply, the commenter expresses disdain for this player by calling him a "little bitch," which implies frustration with an out-group player who has been causing problems for the in-group team. Therefore, "he" in the second sentence should be tagged with [OUT] since it refers to a player from the out-group team (Eagles).	1667153325.0	steelers	eagles	1174		1.0	0.03285367786884297	0.3828989131480235

['Dante']	[(7, 12)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment mentions a player named "Dante" and discusses his performance, specifically noting both a positive ("played well") and a negative aspect (an offsides penalty). Since the commenter is a supporter of the Cowboys and the comment does not contain any derogatory or negative language toward the team but instead seems to be defending the player ("other then that offsides when were n't allowed to see"), it is reasonable to conclude that "Dante" is part of the in-group team (Cowboys). Therefore, "Dante" should be tagged with [IN]. The lack of any explicit mention of an out-group player or team corroborates that this comment is about in-group performance.	EXPLANATION: The comment is discussing a player named Dante, praising his performance except for one specific mistake (an offsides). Given the very high win probability for the in-group, the in-group (Cowboys) is likely performing well overall. Since Dante is mentioned without context and no other team or player is specified, it is logical to conclude that Dante is a player from the in-group team, the Cowboys. Therefore, 'Dante' should be tagged with [IN].	1667160286.0	cowboys	bears	26		6.0	0.999917871915386	0.9764285714285714

Since the commenter is talking about a positive aspect of Ridder's abilities (“where Ridder exceeds”), it is reasonable to assume that they are referring to Ridder as part of the in-group. Therefore, “ridder” should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group’s player.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is referring to Ridder, who is a player for the Falcons, the in-group team. Given that the win probability is low, it makes sense that the fan is looking for silver linings or positive aspects of their team's performance. The comment highlights Ridder's strong performance in play action, indicating an awareness of and support for the in-group's players. Consequently, 'ridder' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	1671909441.0	falcons	ravens	641		7.0	0.05660559237003304	0.4240212342402123

The commenter is a Patriots fan, so 'we' indicates the in-group team, the Patriots. The mention of 'Jets' refers to another team in the NFL that is not the opponent (Buccaneers), thus categorized as [OTHER]. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN], and 'Jets' should be tagged [OTHER].	In this comment, the word 'we' is used to indicate the in-group team, which is the Patriots. Fans often refer to their own team as 'we' when discussing game situations or their team's performance. The commenter expresses concern about the Patriots being tied with another team; this reflects the low win probability of 16.7%, showing that the in-group (Patriots) is not doing well in the game.  The reference to the 'Jets' should be tagged as [OTHER] because the Jets are not the out-group opponent in this specific game (the Buccaneers are). This suggests that the commenter is comparing their in-group team (Patriots) to another team from a different game situation, which in this case, is an 'other' NFL team rather than the current opponent.  Therefore, the entities 'we' correctly denote the in-group (Patriots), and 'Jets' correctly denote an 'other' team not currently playing against the in-group.	1633315332.0	patriots	buccaneers	276		1.0	0.16673960906808	0.7124510971253615

'the offense' in this context would therefore refer to the Dolphins' offense and should be tagged with [IN]. 'the players' are also part of the in-group team and should be tagged with [IN]. McDaniel, presumably referring to Mike McDaniel, the head coach of the Dolphins, should also be tagged [IN], as the commenter is pleased with his performance so far.	EXPLANATION: The comment is praising the offensive strategy and a specific individual, likely the coach Mike McDaniel, which suggests it is about the in-group team, Dolphins. 'the offense' refers to the team's offensive strategy, 'the players' refers to the in-group team's players, and 'McDaniel' likely refers to their coach, Mike McDaniel. Despite the low win probability indicating the Dolphins may not be doing well, the commenter could be appreciating the overall strategic approach and individual performances. Therefore, 'the offense', 'the players', and 'McDaniel' should all be tagged [IN] since they refer to elements of the in-group team.	1663520961.0	dolphins	ravens	26		11.0	0.301195472478867	0.03348643006263048

The second sentence mentions "we" again, which is in-group, and it praises Tucker, a known Ravens player, thus both "we" and "Tucker" should be tagged [IN]. The third sentence expresses positive sentiment about the current situation, implicitly referring to the in-group team, so the [SENT] should be tagged with [IN]. Therefore, 'we', 'we', 'Tucker', and the entire last sentence '[SENT]' are tagged [IN].	The commenter expresses surprise and positivity about the in-group team's performance, even when the overall win probability is low at 27.1%. The use of 'we' indicates the commenter is referring to the Ravens (the in-group).   In the first sentence, 'we' refers to the Ravens. In the second sentence, 'we' again refers to the Ravens, indicating their performance without relying on an exceptional player's long-range field goals. 'Tucker' is a Ravens player known for his kicking ability, so his name is tagged with [IN]. The third sentence implicitly praises the in-group team's performance without specifying them explicitly; hence, the [SENT] token is tagged with [IN] to denote that it's about the Ravens.   Thus, 'we' in the first and second sentences, 'Tucker' in the second sentence, and the whole third sentence are all referring to the in-group (Ravens).	1639953298.0	ravens	packers	1178	 :PBIRD:	13.0	0.270728945732117	0.3744722895895087

['Watkins', 'Hurts', 'Smith']	[(7, 14), (57, 62), (95, 100)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The comment is discussing specific players associated with the in-group team, the Eagles. 'Watkins' is referring to Quez Watkins, an Eagles player, making an important catch. 'Hurts' refers to Jalen Hurts, the Eagles' quarterback, who threw an interception. Similarly, 'Smith' refers to DeVonta Smith, another player for the Eagles who hasn't been targeted during the game. Since all these players are part of the in-group team, each mention of their names should be tagged with [IN].	In this comment, the commenter is describing the actions of certain players without any explicit indication that they are complaining or praising either team more generally. For commenters, player names often reflect players from their own team (in-group), especially without explicit negative commentary suggesting otherwise. Given the context of low win probability, it's reasonable to assume the commenter is focusing on how their team (the in-group) is performing.  First, Watkins and Hurts are players for the Eagles, the in-group team here. The commenter is discussing a sequence where Watkins made a key catch followed by an interception by Hurts. Since these players are part of the Eagles: - 'Watkins' should be tagged [IN] - 'Hurts' should be tagged [IN]  The second sentence talks about Smith not being targeted. Smith, referring to DeVonta Smith, is also a player for the Eagles, thus: - 'Smith' should be tagged [IN]  The win probability is very low, indicating the Eagles are likely losing, thus the focus on the performance of their players is a natural topic for a fan discussing their own team's struggles.

Since the sentiment of the comment is negative and directed towards something that is crucial to the commenter and the parent commenter (the team they support), we can infer that "this team" refers to the in-group team, the Cowboys, that is causing such distress. Therefore, "this team" should be correctly tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be lamenting the performance of their team very harshly, which aligns with the extremely low win probability for the in-group (Cowboys). Given the context of the parent comment, the sentiment is clearly negative about the in-group team. 'this team' refers to the in-group (Cowboys), making it the correct referring expression to be tagged with [IN].	1674441194.0	cowboys	49ers	1181		1.0	0.010242342948914018	0.9423024336888159

In the second sentence, "Refs" refers to the referees, who are neutral parties governing the game and are not part of either the in-group or out-group teams; thus, "Refs" should be tagged with [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: 'the Browns' in the first sentence refers to the in-group team, as the commenter explicitly states their support for them. Therefore, it should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence mentions 'Refs', which refers to the referees, a neutral entity in the game not associated with either team; hence, 'Refs' should be tagged [OTHER], as referees are not part of the in-group or out-group.	1670785221.0	browns	bengals	26		4.0	0.298673391342163	0.3118723098995696

[IN] It fucking sucks and id rather go down with a healthy roster . 	['we', '[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(15, 17), (78, 84), (120, 126)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter uses the term 'we' which typically indicates they are referring to their own team, the in-group (49ers), expressing concern about their quarterback getting hurt. Therefore, 'we' is tagged as [IN]. In the next two sentences, although explicit references to the in-group are not made, the context is about the in-group's situation (dealing with a loss and the state of the roster). Hence, the sentence tokens '[SENT]' for those sentences are tagged as [IN] since the discussion pertains to the commenter’s team.	The commenter uses “we” in the first sentence, which indicates they are talking about the in-group team, the 49ers. The overall sentiment of the comment is one of frustration and disappointment, particularly due to injuries impacting the team’s performance. The very low win probability indicates the team is likely close to losing, which aligns with the context of the comment. The second and third sentences continue this sentiment, targeting no specific entity but maintaining a focus on the in-group's situation. Since these sentences are implicitly referring to the situation of the in-group's team rather than providing specific references to the out-group or another team, they should also be tagged with [IN]. Thus ‘we’ is tagged [IN] in the first sentence, and the entire second and third sentences are tagged [IN] due to the context being about the in-group’s misfortunes and frustrations.  EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing frustration about the 49ers' current state, particularly complaining about their only serviceable QB getting hurt, conveying disappointment over the loss, and lamenting the unhealthy roster. The use of "we" clearly signals the in-group, and the continued focus on the team's dire situation implicitly refers to the 49ers in the subsequent sentences without mentioning another team.

Fans typically use "we" to refer to their own team, indicating a personal connection and support. Therefore, "we" should be tagged with [IN] because it indicates the in-group team the commenter supports (the Raiders). The rest of the sentence does not explicitly mention any team but is implicitly about the in-group, thus '[IN]' here captures the full context of who is losing.	EXPLANATION: The use of "we" typically indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group team they support. Here, the in-group team is the Raiders. Despite having a relatively high win probability, the commenter is expressing skepticism about the Raiders' ability to maintain their lead, which implies they are talking about their own team. Thus, "we" should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to the in-group team, the Raiders.	1671405399.0	raiders	patriots	1183	:Undercarr:	0.0	0.750664964318276	0.6587900117311882

Just let [OUT] get to the first down 	['our defense', 'him']	[(14, 25), (40, 43)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 3]	 The phrase 'our defense' indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group team they support, which in this case is the Falcons. Hence, 'our defense' is tagged [IN]. The mention of 'him' likely refers to a player from the opposing team who is getting to the first down, implying a defensive lapse. Since the out-group team is the Chargers, 'him' should be tagged [OUT]. Therefore, these tags correctly identify the entities as in-group and out-group references respectively.	EXPLANATION: 'our defense' is a phrase that signifies a positive in-group sentiment because the commenter is stating a preference for the unit of the team they support, which in this case, is the Falcons. Therefore, 'our defense' should be tagged [IN]. Conversely, 'him' refers to an opponent player who was allowed to make a play, suggesting he is from the out-group, the Chargers. Thus, 'him' should be tagged [OUT].	1667766512.0	falcons	chargers	329		3.0	0.57594433426857	0.8357796416317194

'Flo' refers to Brian Flores, who was the head coach of the Dolphins, thus 'Flo' should be tagged [IN] as he is associated with the in-group team. The commenter appears to be discussing a change in performance since Flores arrived, which also pertains to the in-group team, underscoring the tagging.	EXPLANATION: This comment discusses Minkah Fitzpatrick and Brian Flores (referred to as 'Flo'). Minkah Fitzpatrick no longer plays for the Dolphins, making him part of another team, so he is tagged [OTHER]. Brian Flores, however, is currently associated with the Dolphins, the in-group team, which is why 'Flo' is tagged [IN]. The exceptionally high win probability suggests the Dolphins have almost certainly won, which might put the commenter in a positive mood, leading to a remark on how a former Dolphin ('Minkah') has improved.	1662931907.0	dolphins	patriots	1185	Spider2  Y Banana	1.0	1.0	1.0

Therefore, "our Defense" should be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence mentions "Brady," who is a player for the Buccaneers, and since the Buccaneers are the out-group, "Brady" should be tagged as [OUT]. The third sentence, "Knock it off," is directed at the in-group, telling them to stop their celebratory behavior, which implies that it pertains to the same in-group team discussed earlier. Since it implicitly refers to the Eagles, the sentence token '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN].	The commenter shows annoyance towards their own team's defense for celebrating, using "our Defense," which is indicative of referring to the in-group team. Consequently, "our Defense" should be tagged [IN]. In the next sentence, "Brady," who is a player for the Buccaneers, the out-group team, is mentioned as doing well, which should be tagged [OUT]. In the final sentence, "Knock it off" is likely a continuation of the complaint directed at their own team's behavior, although without specifying whom, it implicitly refers to the in-group team. Thus, the [SENT] token for that sentence should be tagged [IN] based on the context of the comment's tone and subject matter. This aligns with the overall frustration stemming from an already low win probability for the Eagles.	1642359781.0	eagles	buccaneers	1186		6.0	0.04642248153686501	0.3044874654295655
test	zudthn	j1iyyse	t3_zudthn	[SENT] I sometimes feel like [IN] ’re just tanking these last games 	['we']	[(29, 31)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The word 'we' here typically refers to the team the commenter supports—the in-group. The commenter is expressing a sentiment about their own team's performance ('just tanking'), indicating that it is about the Falcons, the in-group team. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN].	The word 'we' almost always signifies a reference to the in-group, in this case the Falcons. Given the very low win probability (5.9%), it's reasonable to assume that the commenter is frustrated with the performance of their team (the Falcons) and suspects that they are deliberately losing games, a practice known as "tanking". Consequently, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1671909102.0	falcons	ravens	1187		3.0	0.058998573571444	0.3918854867759977
train	sb5v7a	htyoxxi	t3_sb5v7a	[SENT] # WHEELS LIKE [IN] ! 	['HILL']	[(21, 25)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 In the given comment, "HILL" refers to Tyreek Hill, a well-known player for the Kansas City Chiefs (the in-group team). The enthusiastic statement "WHEELS LIKE HILL" suggests admiration for Hill's speed and agility, attributes he is famous for. There are no other players named Hill on the Bills, the out-group team, which further confirms this is a reference to the in-group. Therefore, "HILL" is correctly tagged as [IN] since it pertains to the in-group team player, Tyreek Hill, and aligns with the sentiment expressing pride in his abilities.	EXPLANATION: The phrase "WHEELS LIKE HILL!" is a positive commentary, likely referring to the exceptional speed and athleticism of Tyreek Hill, a well-known player for the Chiefs, who are the in-group in this context. Since the comment exclaims in excitement about Hill's performance, it shows a positive sentiment towards him, indicating support for the in-group team. Consequently, 'HILL' should be tagged as [IN]. The high win probability further supports that the Chiefs are likely performing well, which aligns with the enthusiastic tone of the comment. Thus, "[IN]" is the correct tag for 'HILL'.	1642989720.0	chiefs	bills	1188	Chiefs	3.0	0.737364530563355	0.7282011671815998

train	qoso9l	hjphckt	t3_qoso9l	[IN] This is what happens when you run your routers right 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment describes a scenario that involves proper execution ('run your routers right') typically in favor of the team the commenter supports, which implies the in-group is performing well. Since there are no explicit mentions of teams or players in the sentence, '[SENT]' has to be tagged as [IN], as it is implicitly referring to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is discussing executing plays effectively, which likely refers to a positive play by the in-group team, especially given that the win probability is high (80.8%), indicating that the Browns are probably performing well. The comment does not explicitly mention any players or teams but implies that a successful strategy or execution by the in-group has led to the current positive outcome. Hence, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group.	1636311489.0	browns	bengals	1197		4.0	0.8083188235759731	0.2988361683079678

The first sentence talks about a fumble, assigning part of the blame to Ragnow (a player on the Lions), thus 'Ragnows' should be tagged [IN]. Additionally, Jared Goff is also a player for the in-group team (Lions), evidenced by the positive mention of his performance ('played decent'), hence 'Goff' is tagged [IN]. The second sentence continues to praise Goff's performance, implicitly referring to him as 'He' and 'he' when mentioning his actions ('hitting his deep throws' and 'our leading rusher'), indicating that 'He' and 'he' are both referring to Goff. Therefore, both 'He' and 'he' should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment discusses players on the Lions team, the in-group team the commenter supports. Since there's a very low win probability, the Lions are likely performing poorly, but the commenter is focusing on individual performances. The first sentence mentions Ragnow and Goff, both of whom are Lions players, thus 'Ragnows' and 'Goff' should be tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, 'He' and 'he' both refer to Goff, who is a Lions player, so these pronouns should also be tagged [IN]. Therefore, 'Ragnows', 'Goff', 'He', and 'he' are all tagged correctly as [IN] and explain the focus on in-group team members despite the overall poor game performance.	1671914456.0	lions	panthers	1198	The Goff Father	9.0	0.001396497478708958	0.8565758614468699

The Vikings are neither the in-group (Chiefs) nor the out-group (Giants) team in this context, so 'Vikings' should be tagged [OTHER]. Since 'him' refers to a player from the Vikings who is currently being discussed, it should also be tagged [OTHER], making the reflection on another team's past performance clear.	The comment is reminiscing about the performance of a former player on the Vikings, mentioning a time when the player was dominant. 'Him' refers to Kyle Rudolph, who is currently a Giants player, but here it refers to his past performance with the Vikings, making it appropriate to tag it as [OTHER]. Since the Vikings are neither the in-group (Chiefs) nor the out-group (Giants), 'Vikings' should also be tagged as [OTHER]. The win probability is high for the in-group, but this specific comment is not related to the current game and focuses instead on past events involving a different team. Thus, 'him' and 'Vikings' are tagged as [OTHER] because they refer to an entity and a team that are neither the in-group nor the out-group in the context of this comment.	1635814787.0	chiefs	giants	1199	Travis Kelce #87	1.0	0.762625575065613	0.23802260900771577

[SENT] FUCK [OUT] 	['[SENT]', 'THE PACKERS']	[(0, 6), (33, 44)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	The enthusiasm in the first sentence indicates a positive emotion likely directed toward the in-group team, the Bears. Since there are no explicit words or phrases that refer to the in-group, the sentence itself '[SENT]' is tagged [IN]. In the second sentence, "FUCK THE PACKERS" is an expression of strong negative sentiment toward the Packers, which is the out-group team. Therefore, "THE PACKERS" should be tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The first sentence, "LETS GOOO !!!", is a typical celebratory phrase that is commonly used by fans to cheer for their own team. Given that the in-group team for the commenter is the Bears, this sentence implicitly refers to the in-group team's success or good performance. Hence, the first sentence should be tagged with [IN] despite not mentioning the team explicitly because it expresses support for the in-group. The second sentence, "FUCK THE PACKERS", clearly contains a derogatory remark directed at the Packers, the out-group team. The phrase "THE PACKERS" should be tagged with [OUT] because it clearly refers to the out-group opponent. The win probability of 33.5% indicates that the Bears are not favored to win at this moment, which makes the cheering and the strong statement against the Packers likely a reaction to an unexpected positive play or moment for the Bears rather than the overall state of the game.	1670175916.0	bears	packers	1200	Peanut Tillman	4.0	0.335458606481552	0.0

['Rodgers']	[(108, 115)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter references "Rodgers," who is Aaron Rodgers, the quarterback for the Packers, which is the in-group team. The suggestion that he should have been throwing three downs indicates the commenter's belief in Rodgers' current performance and abilities. Therefore, "Rodgers" should be tagged as [IN] because he is part of the in-group team supported by the commenter. The rest of the sentences do not explicitly mention the in-group or out-group entities, so only "Rodgers" needs to be tagged in this instance.	'SENT' doesn't need to be tagged since it conveys no useful information for entity tagging under the current context, so it's only the second sentence that needs to be tagged. The commenter talks about how they should have used a specific strategy based on Rodgers' performance, who is a well-known player for the Packers, the in-group team. This shows support for Rodgers by emphasizing his strong performance ("the way Rodgers is slinging it right now"). Moreover, the high win probability indicates the in-group is performing well overall, aligning with the praise for Rodgers. Thus, 'Rodgers' should be tagged with [IN].	1664141258.0	packers	buccaneers	1201		6.0	0.802407085895538	0.3462606442058497

Since the commenter is a Vikings fan (in-group), they are likely defending a Vikings player ('he') and suggesting that the player did not commit any infraction towards a Ravens player ('him'). Therefore, 'he' is tagged as [IN] because it refers to a Vikings player, and 'him' is tagged as [OUT] because it refers to a Ravens player.	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 8.4% suggests that the in-group team (Vikings) is in a losing position, which often leads to contentious moments regarding officiating or plays. The comment is about a specific moment where there's a dispute about contact between players. Since 'he' and 'him' refer to the involved players, 'he' is likely referring to a player from the in-group (Vikings), suggesting he didn't make the contact; this reflects the commenter's defensive stance about the in-group team. 'him' would logically refer to a player from the out-group (Ravens), who is supposedly being touched. Thus, 'he' should be tagged [IN] and 'him' should be tagged [OUT] in the context of this interaction.	1636318257.0	vikings	ravens	1202		4.0	0.08378012478351604	0.80073097092007
train	zizm5j	iztwamg	t3_zizm5j	[SENT] Lmao fuck you [OUT] 	['Watson']	[(21, 27)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment expresses strong negative sentiment towards Watson, who is a player for the Browns. Since the commenter supports the Bengals and the Browns are the out-group, Watson is being referred to in a derogatory manner by an opponent's fan. Therefore, 'Watson' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to an out-group entity. hg4rmvc, The commenter is expressing optimism about the game's current score and encouraging action ("let's do this!"), which suggests they are rooting for their in-group team, the Patriots. The excitement and encouragement imply a vested interest in the in-group's success. Therefore, the entire sentiment of the comment is implicitly directed towards the in-group team, justifying the '[SENT]' tag as '[IN]'.	EXPLANATION: While the win probability for the in-group Bengals is high, showing that they are likely winning, the comment is directed at an out-group player, Watson, in an explicitly negative manner. Given the phrasing, it makes sense that the commenter is addressing an opponent player that they are not fond of, which in this case would be someone from the Browns, the out-group team. Therefore, 'Watson' should be tagged with [OUT] since he is a player on the Browns, making the sentiment against him appropriate under the rivalry context of the game.	1670790973.0	bengals	browns	1203	WhoDey!🐅	12.0	0.943418618291616	0.8276542324246772

The comment is about a player from the in-group team, as the commenter is a Giants supporter. Thus, 'Barkley' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The comment mentions "Barkley," who is a notable player for the Giants, the in-group team. Given that the commenter supports the Giants, and Barkley is a player on the Giants, "Barkley" refers to the in-group. With a win probability of 33.2%, it indicates the Giants may not be performing well, but the comment seems to humorously acknowledge a mistake made by an in-group player. Therefore, “Barkley” should be tagged as [IN] because he is a member of the in-group team that the commenter supports.	1638729591.0	giants	dolphins	1205	:Giants-Logo-Oldschool:	1.0	0.33181124925613403	0.2084533209475151

The excitement and encouragement imply a vested interest in the in-group's success. Therefore, the entire sentiment of the comment is implicitly directed towards the in-group team, hence '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing optimism about a close game and rallying support to overcome the deficit. The phrase "let's do this!" indicates encouragement and hope directed towards the team the commenter supports. There are no explicit mentions of the team in the comment, but the sentiment and context clearly show it's about the in-group, the Patriots. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN] since the entire comment implicitly refers to the in-group team.	1633890337.0	patriots	texans	1206	Team Mac 	4.0	0.40147972106933605	0.46674818925783085

Thus, 'He' should be tagged [IN]. Additionally, 'this football team' refers to the in-group (since the comment is lamenting the state of the Packers), so it should also be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment discusses the performance of an individual and references the team in a negative context, likely attributing to the poor state of the in-group (Packers), as indicated by the low win probability. The parent comment provides context about the criticism of Matt LeFleur, a coach for the Packers, implying 'he' refers to someone involved in the in-group (Packers). Thus, 'He' should be tagged [IN]. 'this football team' implicitly refers to the Packers, wherein 'Everyone is responsible for this football team being horrible' blames the entire team, which should be tagged [IN].	1667762766.0	packers	lions	1207		0.0	0.314803928136826	0.4480502017032721
train	rk5mur	hp82tkc	t3_rk5mur	[IN] WHAT A FAIR CATCH 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[3]	 The comment "WHAT A FAIR CATCH" likely implies excitement or approval, which is usually reserved for plays made by the in-group team the commenter supports (Packers). Since there is no explicit mention of a team or player in the comment, the entire sentence should be tagged as [IN] to indicate it refers to the in-group team. Therefore, '[SENT]' is used as the referring expression tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing admiration for a fair catch, which likely comes from appreciation of a play executed by a player on the team the commenter supports, which is the in-group team (Packers). The relatively high win probability further supports the idea that the comment is positively referring to the in-group's performance. Since there is no explicit mention of an entity in the comment, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] to indicate implicit reference to the in-group.	1639953612.0	packers	ravens	1208		3.0	0.79260328412056	0.40267672684810923

The use of Dak in this comment shows that the commenter is referring to a player from their in-group team, the Cowboys. The critical style of the comment suggests frustration, likely because Dak has made a mistake or is struggling, which a supporter of the in-group might express. Therefore, 'Dak' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: 'Dak' refers to Dak Prescott, the quarterback for the Cowboys, the in-group team. The commenter appears to be making a sarcastic remark about Dak Prescott's handling of the ball, which implies criticism of an in-group player despite the high win probability indicating the team is doing well overall. Because 'Dak' is a player on the Cowboys, it is tagged as [IN]. The comment lacks any explicit reference to the out-group team (Titans), so there's no need to tag anything as [OUT] or [OTHER].	1672366834.0	cowboys	titans	971		2.0	0.9618902206420898	0.35614550799191624

['Hurts', 'we']	[(7, 12), (86, 88)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 Jalen Hurts is a quarterback for the Eagles, which is the in-group team. Therefore, 'Hurts' should be tagged [IN]. The use of 'we' indicates the commenter is referring to the in-group team (Eagles), showing their identification with and support for the team. Thus, 'we' should also be tagged [IN]. Both entities are expressing the commenter's dissatisfaction with the performance of the in-group team, reinforcing this tagging decision.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Eagles, and the win probability for them is fairly low, suggesting they are not doing well in the game. 'Hurts' refers to Jalen Hurts, the quarterback for the Eagles, which should be tagged as [IN] since he is part of the in-group. The use of the pronoun 'we' denotes the commenter including themselves as a part of the in-group team (Eagles) fanbase, which means 'we' should also be tagged as [IN]. Hence, both 'Hurts' and 'we' are tagged correctly as [IN].	1633889513.0	eagles	panthers	1209		2.0	0.16558837890625	0.3630812178312833

When the commenter says "Canada makes me wanna set my head on fucking fire," they are expressing frustration with the in-group team's coaching staff. Therefore, "Canada" is tagged with [IN] since it refers to an entity (a person) associated with the in-group team, the Steelers.	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing extreme frustration with Canada, who is the offensive coordinator for the Steelers, the in-group team. Given the very low win probability (7.7%), it's clear the Steelers are not performing well, which aligns with the comment's tone of frustration and blame. Since Matt Canada is part of the in-group team's coaching staff, the mention of 'Canada' should be tagged as [IN].	1666573449.0	steelers	dolphins	1211	:troy1::troy2:Troy	6.0	0.07743124663829803	0.22524199553239016

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[3]	 The comment "Thats how you get paid." is likely expressing approval or admiration for a successful play or performance by a player. Since there is no explicit mention of any team or player in the comment, the commenter is implicitly referring to a player from the in-group (the 49ers) because fans typically highlight successful moments from their own team. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' to indicate that the entire sentence implicitly refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment "That's how you get paid" expresses admiration or approval, likely directed towards a significant play or performance. Given the high win probability (97.4%) for the in-group team (49ers), it suggests that the commenter is referring to the successful actions of an in-group player. Since there is no explicit mention of a specific player or the team in the sentence, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN] because it implicitly refers to an impressive performance by the in-group.	1669594275.0	49ers	saints	1212		3.0	0.974223742261529	0.9284103720405863

['our defense', 'Seattle']	[(11, 22), (42, 49)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing frustration about their own team's defense, indicated by the phrase "our defense," which refers to the in-group (Falcons). Therefore, "our defense" should be tagged [IN]. The reference to "Seattle" implies they are talking about the location of the out-group (Seahawks), who are hosting the game. Consequently, "Seattle" should be tagged [OUT]. The second sentence "Holy hell ..." doesn't contain specific references to any entities, but it's an expression of frustration relevant to the previous sentence about the in-group team. Thus, the entities are correctly tagged with [IN] for "our defense" and [OUT] for "Seattle."	EXPLANATION: The comment is a criticism of the in-group's (Falcons') defense for not performing well, likening their performance to them not showing up for the game. The phrase "our defense" indicates that the commenter is referring to the Falcons' defense, the in-group, thus it should be tagged [IN]. "Seattle" refers to the city representing the opponent team, the Seahawks (out-group), so it should be tagged [OUT]. The exclamation "[SENT] Holy hell ..." expresses frustration presumably about the in-group's poor performance, but does not contain explicit references to in-group, out-group, or other, hence it is not tagged.	1664144718.0	falcons	seahawks	1213		4.0	0.314697921276092	0.6927228915662651
train	xtsbpl	iqsi3qy	t3_xtsbpl	[IN] Go for it . [SENT] Who gives a shit . 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is encouraging their team (the in-group) to take a risk, as indicated by "Go for it." This type of supportive or urging language is typically directed at the team the commenter supports, which in this case is the Commanders. Therefore, the sentence "Go for it" is tagged [IN]. There are no explicit mentions of the in-group, out-group, or other entities in the second sentence, and it seems to express a general sense of frustration or resignation, which is not explicitly directed at any particular team, so it remains as a standalone `[SENT]`. The lack of explicit group mention means no specific tags are required for the second sentence.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the Commanders is very low, suggesting they are likely in a losing position. The comment "Go for it" can be construed as encouragement directed towards their own team to take a risk, potentially because they have little to lose given their current predicament. The absence of explicit reference to the in-group still means the first sentence is implicitly about the in-group, hence '[SENT]' should be tagged with [IN]. The second sentence, "Who gives a shit," can be seen as a more general expression of frustration or indifference, typical when a fan feels that a comeback is unlikely, and thus it remains untagged.	1664739740.0	commanders	cowboys	1214	:commanders:	3.0	0.046866964548825996	0.858537022114782

train	qtokd8	hkmh22b	t3_qtokd8	[SENT] [IN] heard your slander 	['Defense']	[(7, 14)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment mentions "Defense" without qualification, which usually means the commenter is referring to their own team's defense. Given that the in-group team is the Cowboys, "Defense" refers to the Cowboys' defense. Therefore, "Defense" should be tagged with [IN] as it references the in-group team. There are no other entities mentioned that need tagging in this comment.	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely referring to the in-group defense because it states "Defense heard your slander," which implies a reaction to prior criticism. Since "Defense" is mentioned without additional context, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is talking about their team's defense. Given the high win probability, it suggests that the Cowboys' defense (the in-group) has performed well, and the comment serves as a response to earlier doubters or critics. Therefore, "Defense" should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group, the Cowboys.	1636917804.0	cowboys	falcons	1218	Marion Barber	1.0	0.994523878674954	0.4631518733911717
test	s5h30d	hsy2im5	t1_hsy1scd	[SENT] [IN] got a garbage arm so … 	['Qb']	[(7, 9)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment is expressing frustration about the quarterback's (Qb) performance, specifically mentioning that their arm is 'garbage.' Since this frustration is likely directed at the commenter’s own team, it is reasonable to conclude that 'Qb' refers to the in-group team, the Eagles in this case. Thus, 'Qb' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The win probability of 0.0% indicates that the in-group (Eagles) is almost certainly losing the game, reflecting a highly negative sentiment among fans. The parent comment complains about the current state of the game, reinforcing the negative context. The term 'Qb' (quarterback) is used without any qualifying indication that it refers to the other team, which indicates that the commenter is most likely criticizing their own team's quarterback. Therefore, 'Qb' should be tagged with [IN], as it refers to a player on the in-group team, the Eagles.	1642365398.0	eagles	buccaneers	1219		1.0	2.1696090698020143e-05	0.8056026407351236

Chase is a player for the Bengals, and thus should be tagged [OUT]. The term 'Bengals fans' refers to the supporters of the out-group team (Bengals), so it should be tagged [OUT]. 'Burrow' is another Bengals player, and is mentioned multiple times, each instance tagged with [OUT]. The word 'him' in "call for him to be benched" and "Get him out of here" refers to Burrow, who is part of the out-group, thus both occurrences are tagged as [OUT]. The comment is framed entirely around the out-group Bengals, referencing their players and hypothetical reactions from their fans.	EXPLANATION: The comment is referring to players and fans from the out-group team, the Bengals. The commenter is a Raiders fan and is discussing hypothetical reactions of Bengals fans if Chase, a Bengals player, had dropped a pass. 'Chase' is a player for the Bengals and thus should be tagged [OUT]. 'Bengals' refers to the out-group team and should also be tagged [OUT]. 'Burrow' is the quarterback for the Bengals, so instances of 'Burrow' and 'him' referring to Burrow should be tagged [OUT] as well. The win probability is very low for the in-group Raiders, indicating they are likely losing and could be venting frustration or discussing other teams, as seen here. Each sentence is discussing the out-group, thus all references 'Chase', 'Bengals', 'Burrow', and 'him' are tagged [OUT].	1642289276.0	raiders	bengals	1220		3.0	0.10930377244949296	0.5735820132856413

'Pete' refers to Pete Carroll, who is the head coach of the Seahawks, hence it should be tagged [IN]. The commenter then uses the pronoun 'him' to refer to Pete Carroll again, thus 'him' should also be tagged with [IN]. Lastly, the mention of 'we' in the second sentence again refers to the in-group team (the Seahawks), indicating that the commenter is discussing the future of their team's coaching staff. Therefore, the phrases 'we' (twice), 'Pete', and 'him' all refer to in-group entities, validating that 'we', 'Pete', 'him', 'we' should be tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter uses 'we' to refer to the in-group team, the Seahawks, indicating they are a fan. Despite a high win probability of 89.9%, the commenter is suggesting that firing Pete is an acceptable action, showing dissatisfaction. 'Pete' refers to Pete Carroll, the head coach of the Seahawks, making it an in-group reference. The pronoun 'him' in the second sentence also refers to Pete Carroll, keeping it within the in-group context. The second instance of 'we' continues to refer to the Seahawks. Therefore, 'we', 'Pete', 'him', and 'we' should all be tagged as [IN] since they denote entities associated with the in-group team.	1633299122.0	seahawks	49ers	1221		1.0	0.899237141013145	0.6724778761061947

The use of "They" and "they" in this context suggests a reference to the out-group team, which is the Patriots. The sentiment implies a belief that the opposing team had been given an advantage (perhaps unfairly) and would not concede it unless due to a makeup call. Therefore, both instances of "They" and "they" should be tagged with [OUT] since they refer to the out-group team (Patriots) in this context.	EXPLANATION: Given that the in-group team is the Cowboys and the out-group team is the Patriots, and the comment suggests that 'They' won't give up the call, it is reasonable to assume that 'They' refers to the out-group team, the Patriots. The win probability for the Cowboys is moderately high, which indicates that the commenter might be concerned about the officiating favoring the out-group. 'They' and 'they' both refer to the Patriots, thus they should be tagged as [OUT].	1634502757.0	cowboys	patriots	1222		1.0	0.587912380695343	0.03365738093293032

[IN] Shit any and all curses that could happen seems to be what is happening to us lol 	['we', '[SENT]']	[(19, 21), (77, 83)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is likely a supporter of the in-group team, the Cardinals, expressing frustration about their team’s performance. The word "we" in the first sentence implies the in-group because fans typically refer to their own team with inclusive language such as "we". In the second sentence, the lack of an explicit mention of any team but the continuation of the theme of curses affecting "us" indicates the commenter is again referring to their in-group team, the Cardinals. Therefore, the first sentence "I wonder if we built our stadiums on ancient burial grounds as well ?" contains an implicit reference to the in-group "we" and should be tagged [IN]. The second sentence "Shit any and all curses that could happen seems to be what is happening to us lol" expresses a similar frustration, and thus the entire sentence should be tagged [IN] since it implicitly refers to the in-group.	The commenter is questioning why their team, the Cardinals, might be experiencing bad luck, which is reflected in the use of "we" and "us." Expressions like "we" and the implication in the second sentence are referring to the in-group because the commenter is talking about their own team. The low win probability supports the sentiment of facing struggles or curses. Therefore, "we" in the first sentence and the entire second sentence should be tagged [IN] because they refer to the in-group.	1639942339.0	cardinals	lions	443	:Primary1: Kyler Murray	2.0	0.327962964773178	0.4930130605534752

In the first sentence, "he" most likely refers to Joe Burrow standing on his own after a rough play. Since Joe Burrow is a player for the Bengals, "he" should be tagged as [IN]. 2. The second sentence, "That looked rough," likely refers to a play involving the in-group player (Joe), but it doesn't explicitly mention him. Thus, it doesn't need an entity tag. 3. In the third sentence, "Joe" is referred to directly as being "so bad ass," which is a positive sentiment directed at an in-group player, so "Joe" should be tagged as [IN]. 4. In the fourth sentence, "We" refers to the Bengals fans or the team itself, which is the in-group, so it should be tagged as [IN]. "him" at the end of the sentence again refers to Joe Burrow, who is part of the in-group, so it should be tagged as [IN].  Thus, all the tagged references correctly identify the entities related to the in-group (Bengals), explaining	The commenter is likely referring to Joe Burrow, a player on the Bengals, which is the in-group team. The first sentence expresses relief that "he" is standing on his own, indicating concern for an in-group player. The second sentence reflects the roughness of the situation without specifying who it pertains to, but the context implies it’s about the same player. In the third sentence, "Joe" explicitly refers to Joe Burrow and describes him as "bad ass," indicating admiration, which in turn indicates he's from the in-group. Lastly, in the fourth sentence, "We" typically means the fan base or team members of the in-group, and "him" again refers to Joe Burrow. Each of these expressions correlates with the Bengals, who are the in-group, thus they should be tagged [IN].	1633889384.0	bengals	packers	1223	who dey, I'll tell you h'what	4.0	0.350154340267181	0.3342440801457195

The use of 'Lmao' suggests a tone of amusement, indicating that the commenter is expressing approval or cheering for the action. Therefore, 'Maxx' should be tagged as [IN], since it refers to an in-group player. The phrase 'that man' refers to an opponent player from the out-group (49ers), but since it is not explicitly tagged in the TARGET, the focus is on 'Maxx' being tagged correctly as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is referring to 'Maxx,' who is likely a player on the in-group team (Cardinals), as per the context. The expression 'Lmao' suggests amusement or approval, implying that the commenter is pleased with Maxx's performance, which typically means it is about a player from their own team. Additionally, with a high win probability, it is consistent that the commenter would be celebrating a play made by an in-group player. 'Maxx' should therefore be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1633901063.0	cardinals	49ers	1224		12.0	0.927054762840271	0.32370737073707373

Evans, while potentially a less commonly known player as a Bengals player, is being directly compared to Mixon and Perine, so in this context, it is reasonable to consider Evans as referring to another player from the Bengals. Therefore, 'Mixon' and 'Perine' should be tagged with [IN]. The comparative nature of the comment doesn't signal any out-group association here, but since Evans is also treated as a significant player in the NFL, another interpretation could be that Evans might refer to another player outside of the immediate game context, leading to an [OTHER] tag. Hence, Mixon, Evans, and Perine are correctly tagged as [IN], [OTHER], and [IN], respectively.	EXPLANATION: Mixon and Perine are both players on the Bengals, the in-group team for the commenter. Therefore, both 'Mixon' and 'Perine' should be tagged with [IN] as they are part of the in-group. Evans, meanwhile, is a player on another team in the NFL (Buccaneers) and not part of the current game between the Bengals and Titans, making him part of the other group. Therefore, Evans should be tagged with [OTHER].

['Bill']	[(69, 73)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is referring to "Bill," who is most likely Bill Belichick, the head coach of the Patriots, given that the commenter supports the Patriots. The mention of fake punts and the use of "Bill" in this context strongly suggest that the commenter is talking about a coach from their in-group team. Therefore, "Bill" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group entity.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is talking about Bill Belichick, who is the head coach of the Patriots, the in-group team. The use of the name 'Bill' without any additional context implies that this is an in-group reference that other fans of the Patriots would readily understand. The win probability is relatively low, suggesting that the commenter might be reflecting on past strategies or decisions by their team (the Patriots). Since 'Bill' refers to the head coach of the in-group team, it should be tagged with [IN].	1641768556.0	patriots	dolphins	1226		2.0	0.327733397483826	0.452276467361492

Given that the commenter is a Steelers fan (in-group), it makes sense that they are focusing on players from their own team. Therefore, 'Warren' and 'Najee' should be tagged as [IN] because they are part of the in-group team. Additionally, 'Harris' should also be tagged as [IN] because Najee Harris is a member of the Steelers, and it follows that the critique about his playing style is directed toward an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the Steelers is extremely low, suggesting they are struggling in the game and prompting commenters to express their frustrations. Warren and Najee are both referring to Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren, who are players for the Steelers, the in-group team. The commenter is expressing a preference for seeing more of one in-group player over another, indicating frustration with how Najee Harris is performing. 'Warren' and 'Najee' in the first sentence and 'Harris' in the second sentence should all be tagged [IN] because they refer to members of the in-group team, the Steelers.	1667156509.0	steelers	eagles	1227		3.0	0.02601516805589199	0.6891410983937675

'Raegor' and 'Hurts' are players drafted by the Eagles, thus they should be tagged [IN]. 'CeeDee Lamb' is a player for the Cowboys, making him part of the out-group and should be tagged [OUT]. 'Justin Jefferson' is a player for another team in the NFL (Minnesota Vikings), which makes him [OTHER]. 'Howie' refers to Howie Roseman, the Eagles' General Manager, thus related to the in-group and should be tagged [IN].	The comment begins with "Friendly reminder, we thought drafting Raegor and Hurts was better than trading up for CeeDee Lamb or drafting Justin Jefferson." Here, "we" stands for the in-group team, the Eagles, since the commenter identifies themselves with the in-group. This is further supported by the following words "Raegor" and "Hurts," who are players drafted by the Eagles. Therefore, these are tagged [IN]. The phrase "trading up for CeeDee Lamb" mentions a player from the Cowboys, the out-group team, hence "CeeDee Lamb" is tagged [OUT]. "Justin Jefferson" is a player from another NFL team, the Vikings, so he is tagged [OTHER].  In the next sentence, "Thanks Howie!", "Howie" refers to Howie Roseman, the Eagles' general manager, which clearly designates him as part of the in-group, thus [IN].  Given the win probability is 100%, the commenter is likely reflecting on past decisions with the benefit of hindsight rather than expressing frustration over a current game situation.  Thus, the tags for 'we', 'Raegor', 'Hurts', 'CeeDee Lamb', 'Justin Jefferson', and '	1632799580.0	eagles	cowboys	1228		2.0	1.0	1.0

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[3]	 The comment shows an exasperated reaction to a play, likely a good throw by a player that the commenter supports, since it mentions a "tight window" indicating a challenging and successful pass. Such emotional expressions are typically used by supporters of the in-group team because they are emotionally invested in the game. Therefore, the entire sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group team, thus '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' since there is no explicit word/phrase that refers to the in-group, but the comment is referring to the in-group implicitly.	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses a strong emotional reaction to a recent throw that was made during the game. Given that the in-group team (Steelers) has a fairly low win probability (39.5%), it suggests that the game is tense, and supporters are deeply invested in each play. The commenter is likely a fan of the in-group team, the Steelers, as they are reacting to a play likely made by their team with intense personal stake ("just shaved 15 minutes off the end of my life"). The phrase "holy shit what a tight window" likely refers to an impressive throw made by a player on the in-group team. Since the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team but does not contain explicit team-specific words or phrases, the entire sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged as [IN].	1671932875.0	steelers	raiders	1229	:sh::h8::sh: Pickett	9.0	0.394692689180374	0.17772420443587272

By replying with "For real," the commenter is agreeing with the critical assessment. This agreement implies insider knowledge and criticism of their own team. Since the comment implicitly refers to in-group dynamics without mentioning any explicit entities, the sentence itself is tagged with [IN]. Thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since the comment pertains to the in-group Falcons.	The parent comment criticizes Matt Ryan, who has a longstanding association with the Falcons. Given that the commenter supports the Falcons, their expression "For real" is an agreement with the criticism of Matt Ryan from their perspective as a Falcons fan. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as the comment implicitly refers to the in-group (Falcons) by endorsing the criticism of a key player associated with them.	1631469981.0	falcons	eagles	1230	Quintorris Lopez	1.0	0.404036283493042	0.3232413178984862

['Higgins']	[(40, 47)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment appears to be about a player named Higgins, who is presumably a member of the in-group team (Panthers). The commenter is sarcastically addressing people who might have previously questioned or criticized Higgins, implying that he has made a significant play or performance. Since Higgins is a member of the in-group team, he is tagged as [IN]. This reflects the support and defense of the in-group team and its players.	EXPLANATION: Even though the win probability for the in-group (Panthers) is high, the commenter appears to be addressing those who were previously criticizing or questioning the presence/performance of Higgins. Higgins is not stated as being part of the Cardinals (out-group), so he must logically be a player for the Panthers (in-group). Hence, 'Higgins' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Panthers).	1664744597.0	panthers	cardinals	26		8.0	0.823316037654877	0.3088591688358316

Since "bucs" refers to the Buccaneers, which are the opposing team (out-group) in this context, it is tagged [OUT]. There are no other explicit words or phrases referring to the in-group (Eagles) or other (another team in the NFL) in the sentence. Therefore, tagging "bucs" as [OUT] is appropriate, fulfilling the intended meaning.	EXPLANATION: The commenter has a win probability of 0.0%, which indicates that their team, the Eagles, is almost certainly losing the game. The phrase "At this point I hope the bucs put 50 on em" indicates a sense of resignation and an implied desire for the opponent to finish the game decisively. The term "bucs" refers to the Buccaneers, the out-group opponent, and should be tagged as [OUT]. The rest of the sentence doesn't contain explicit references to any entity but "[em]" implicitly refers to the in-group (Eagles), however, it is not tagged explicitly in this approach. Thus, the tag [OUT] for "bucs" is accurate.	1642365572.0	eagles	buccaneers	26		3.0	2.8252601623979245e-05	0.8211258809884914

This makes 'Raider' an 'other' entity. Therefore, 'Raider' should be tagged [OTHER] because it refers to a team that is neither the in-group (Chargers) nor the out-group (Jaguars). The overall vibe or behavior being compared is attributed to fans of a different team, establishing it as an 'other' entity context.	EXPLANATION: 'Raider' refers to the Las Vegas Raiders, which is another team in the NFL and neither the in-group (Chargers) nor the out-group (Jaguars) in this context. The comment is talking about a 'Raider fan' to describe a certain behavior or vibe, which means the reference is to a team other than the in-group and out-group.

Since the commenter is a 49ers fan, "49er" is tagged as [IN] and "packer" as [OUT]. - In the third sentence, the commenter talks about their family being fans of the Packers, hence "packer" fans is tagged with [OUT]. - In the fifth sentence, the commenter's friends are also described as Packers fans, so "packer" fans is tagged as [OUT] again. - In the sixth sentence, the commenter reveals their personal support for the 49ers from a young age. Therefore, "9ers" is tagged as [IN], and "them" refers to the 49ers as well, thus tagged [IN]. - The final sentence expresses enthusiastic support for the in-group team without explicitly mentioning it. The sentiment and context make it clear that "Let 's fucking do this !!!" is a rallying cry for the 49ers. Therefore, the [SENT]	The comment discusses a personal connection to both the Packers and the 49ers, though the commenter ultimately supports the 49ers. Here’s why the entities are tagged as they are:  1. In the first sentence, "49er" and "packer" are mentioned together in the context of a special game. "49er" refers to the in-group team, and "packer" refers to the out-group opponent. Therefore, "49er" should be tagged [IN] and "packer" should be tagged [OUT].  2. In the third sentence, the commenter mentions that their entire family are Packers fans. "packer" refers to the out-group team and should therefore be tagged with [OUT].  3. In the fifth sentence, the commenter states that many of their friends are Packers fans. Again, "packer" refers to the out-group team and should be tagged with [OUT].  4. In the sixth sentence, the commenter discusses their long-term support for the 49ers. "9ers" refers to the in-group team and should be tagged with [IN]. When they refer to having stuck with "them," "them" also refers to the in-group team, the 49ers, and should be tagged with [IN].  5. The	1642900410.0	49ers	packers	1235		10.0	0.704978406429291	0.0

Given that the in-group team is the Buccaneers, it is reasonable to conclude that 'Dean' is a player for the Buccaneers. Therefore, 'Dean' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team with respect to the commenter.	EXPLANATION: While the comment does not directly state whether 'Dean' is on the in-group or out-group team, the context provided and the high win probability for the in-group Buccaneers indicate that the commenter is likely referring to a player from their own team performing well. Given that Dean is not a common surname for players on the Eagles (the out-group), it is more reasonable to assume that the commenter is referring to Jamel Dean, a cornerback for the Buccaneers. Therefore, 'Dean' should be tagged as [IN] because he is likely an in-group player being praised for his performance.	1634263756.0	buccaneers	eagles	1237	:RedJersey13: Mike Evans	5.0	0.9677424728870392	0.596205710034409

['we', 'Josh Allen']	[(21, 23), (66, 76)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The comment is about why the Bengals (the in-group) haven't accumulated 10 sacks, attributing this to the skill of Josh Allen, an out-group player for the Bills. The use of 'we' refers to the in-group team the commenter supports (the Bengals), which is why it is tagged [IN]. 'Josh Allen' is tagged [OUT] because he is a player for the Bills, the out-group opponent. The second sentence refers to Lamar Jackson, who plays for neither the Bengals nor the Bills, but this sentence doesn't have any explicit in-group or out-group reference, hence it remains untagged in the TARGET output.	EXPLANATION: 'we' typically refers to the in-group, which in this case is the Bengals. Since the commenter is expressing surprise and attributing the lack of sacks to Josh Allen's performance, Josh Allen is therefore a player from the out-group (Bills). The high win probability suggests the Bengals are doing well overall but may struggle to sack Josh Allen, indicating respect for his elusiveness. Thus, 'we' should be tagged [IN] and 'Josh Allen' should be tagged [OUT]. 'Lamar' in the second sentence refers to Lamar Jackson, who plays for neither the Bengals nor the Bills, so this sentence should not be tagged with [IN], [OUT], or [OTHER].	1674427408.0	bengals	bills	1238		8.0	0.9764615595340729	0.8903629998157362

The question "Is this defense for real?" suggests curiosity or incredulity about the in-group's defense performance, implying a positive assessment. Therefore, 'this defense' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the defense of the team the commenter supports, in this case, the Bills.	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'this defense' refers to the defense of the in-group team, which is the Bills in this case. The high win probability suggests that the team is performing well, so the commenter is likely expressing a mixture of disbelief and admiration towards their own team's defense. With no specific mention of the Rams (the out-group team), 'this defense' should be tagged [IN] as it implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Bills.	1662685248.0	bills	rams	1239	Standing Buffalo	7.0	0.7454731464385991	0.22722682286406787

This indicates that the decision to keep MLF is related to the in-group team, which the commenter supports. Therefore, 'MLF' should be tagged [IN], as it refers to the in-group entity.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is unhappy with the performance of their team's current quarterback (QB) and the coach, MLF, who is most likely the in-group's coach (in this case, Matt LaFleur of the Jets). The very low win probability indicates that the in-group is not doing well in the game, which aligns with the frustration expressed in the comment. 'MLF' is tagged [IN] because the commenter is advocating for not giving another season to their own team's coach if they are bringing in a new QB. Therefore, the larger context of the comment is about the in-group, the Jets.	1672614776.0	jets	seahawks	1240		4.0	0.08019552379846595	0.6927475719342834

Matt Nagy was the head coach of the Bears, and "JF" likely refers to Justin Fields, the Bears' quarterback. The commenter is expressing concern from the perspective of a Bears fan, indicating that "Nagy" and "JF" are part of the in-group. Therefore, both "Nagy" and "JF" should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Bears, and Matt Nagy is the head coach for the Bears. So, 'Nagy' refers to the in-group team, thus it should be tagged [IN]. 'JF' stands for Justin Fields, who is the quarterback for the Bears. Hence, 'JF' also refers to the in-group and should be tagged [IN] accordingly. The high win probability suggests that the Bears are likely to win, yet the commenter is concerned about the head coach's decision regarding their quarterback, which is why both 'Nagy' and 'JF' are tagged as in-group entities.	1632077841.0	bears	bengals	1241	Hicks	3.0	0.773218512535095	0.6589733767477495

'Green Bay' and 'Nathan Peterman' refer to entities not involved in the current match-up between the Browns and Texans, therefore both are tagged as [OTHER], since they belong to other teams in the NFL.	The comment refers to 'Green Bay' and 'Nathan Peterman', which are not relevant to the current game between the Browns (in-group) and the Texans (out-group). It is about the commenter making a decision in their fantasy team based on players not involved in the Browns vs. Texans game. 'Green Bay' refers to the Green Bay Packers, and 'Nathan Peterman' is a quarterback not associated with either the Browns or the Texans, making them 'other' NFL entities. This aligns with the context provided by the parent comment, which discusses fantasy football decisions involving third-party teams. Thus, 'Green Bay' and 'Nathan Peterman' should be tagged [OTHER].	1670186871.0	browns	texans	1242		2.0	0.9890578174963593	0.8685524126455907

The phrase 'we can do for you' implies a connection and solidarity with the in-group team. Therefore, 'DJ' should be tagged [IN], and it is the only referring expression in the comment.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Steelers, and ‘DJ’ presumably refers to Diontae Johnson, a Steelers player. The high win probability indicates the Steelers are likely winning comfortably, and the comment seems lightheartedly apologizing to DJ about not scoring a touchdown, which supporters often do for their own team to soften the blow of a less-than-ideal situation even in a winning game. Hence, 'DJ' should be tagged with [IN] since it denotes a player on the in-group team.	1673211103.0	steelers	browns	1243		3.0	0.979012664407492	0.9251663476437881

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	[3]	 The comment is discussing the pressure felt by a player to save their franchise from mediocrity. Since the comment expresses concern about the success of a franchise that is not the in-group, it logically refers to the out-group opponent team in this context. In-group fans typically do not discuss their own players with this level of detachment and concern about their franchise's mediocrity in this manner, implying the commenter is talking about the opponent team here. Therefore, the entire sentence is implicitly referring to the out-group team in this context and is tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The comment speaks about a franchise depending on someone's success to save them from mediocrity. Given that the Bears and Commanders are playing, the commenter would not refer to their own team (the Bears) in such a negative way, especially since they are currently underdogs with a win probability below 50%. This kind of broad criticism is more likely directed at the out-group (Commanders), particularly if a key player for the out-group is perceived to be under pressure to achieve success. Hence, the sentence refers implicitly to the out-group, so '[SENT]' should be tagged with [OUT] because no specific entity (like a team's name or player's name) is mentioned.	1665706742.0	bears	commanders	764	1	1.0	0.459962069988251	0.020370189011849966

Since the commenter supports the Bears (the in-group) and praises Kmet's catching ability, it is reasonable to conclude that Kmet is a member of the in-group. Therefore, 'Kmet' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a player on the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The in-group is the Bears, and Cole Kmet is a tight end who plays for the Bears. The comment is pointing out that Kmet is able to catch the ball today, which is a positive remark. Since Kmet is a player on the in-group team, 'Kmet' should be tagged with [IN].	1635702205.0	bears	49ers	26		2.0	0.492060959339142	0.22515827140104597

The laughter and disbelief expressed in the comment indicate that they are speaking about their own team, the Commanders, hence "Commanders" should be tagged [IN]. The second and third sentences in the comment are linked to the Commanders due to the context provided in the first sentence. Although these sentences do not contain explicit references to the team, their content is connected to the previously mentioned "Commanders." Therefore, these sentences should be tagged with [IN], represented by '[SENT]'.	EXPLANATION: The comment is about the Commanders, which is the in-group team for the commenter. The commenter talks about having not watched the NFL in a while and being surprised by the name 'Commanders.' The reference here is clearly to the in-group team, as it's a direct mention of the team's name. The win probability indicates the Commanders are likely doing relatively well in the game, which aligns with the comment's tone being more amused than critical. Since the comment continues to discuss the surprising nature of the team name, the subsequent sentences are implicitly still about the Commanders, even without specifically mentioning them again. Therefore, 'Commanders' is tagged [IN], and the subsequent sentences without explicit references are tagged [IN] as well, thus '[SENT]', '[SENT]' are referring implicitly to the Commanders.	1664726878.0	commanders	cowboys	26		-7.0	0.595943093299866	0.0

The word "we" is used by the commenter to refer to the in-group (Dolphins), expressing a sense of unity with their supported team, so it should be tagged [IN]. Similarly, "them" refers back to "we," indicating reliance on the in-group team, and hence it should also be tagged [IN]. The overall context of the comment suggests that it is in reference to the Patriots' defense and the Dolphins' need for them to fail, which underscores the distinctions between in-group and out-group.	The comment is about the Dolphins, the in-group team of the commenter, waiting for a stop against the Patriots, the out-group team. The reference to "pats" is shorthand for the Patriots, so it is tagged [OUT]. The words "we" and "them" reflect the in-group team, the Dolphins, and their need to count on their own efforts for the needed play. The win probability is slightly above 50%, indicating a close game situation where the commenter's focus is on a critical defensive stop. Therefore, it makes sense that "pats" is tagged [OUT], and "we" and "them" are tagged [IN].	1631487183.0	dolphins	patriots	1244		1.0	0.537023723125458	0.8494386335284522

['[SENT]', '[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (78, 84), (111, 117)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter is discussing their team's performance positively, mentioning good defensive drives and an offensive touchdown, which suggests they are talking about their in-group team (Vikings). The encouragement to "keep this going" and "flip the field" further indicates that they are rooting for their own team to maintain momentum and improve field position. Therefore, while these sentences don’t contain explicit mentions of team-specific players or names, they are implicitly referring to the in-group team. Hence, all the [SENT] tokens should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The low win probability suggests that the Vikings are currently losing. However, the commenter is talking about a positive sequence of events - two good defensive drives and an offensive touchdown, which indicates they are referring to their own team, the in-group (Vikings). The use of "Let's" and the positive tone also implies that the commenter is encouraging their own team. Even though none of the sentences explicitly mention the in-group, the context clearly indicates it is about the in-group Vikings. Therefore, the entire comment is implicitly referring to the in-group team, so each sentence ([SENT]) should be tagged as [IN].	1636309981.0	vikings	ravens	1245	Norwegian Viking	2.0	0.389110624790192	0.14317495630065152

Similarly, Kelce refers to Jason Kelce, the center for the Eagles, who is also used in a positive manner in this comment. Therefore, both 'Jalen' and 'Kelce' refer to in-group players and should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: 'Jalen' and 'Kelce' refer to in-group players because the commenter is an Eagles supporter, and both Jalen Hurts and Jason Kelce are key players for the Eagles. The high win probability (99.8%) indicates that the Eagles are doing very well in the game, making it likely that the commenter is referring to a positive play involving these players. 'Jalen' is Jalen Hurts, the Eagles' quarterback, and 'Kelce' is Jason Kelce, their center. Therefore, both 'Jalen' and 'Kelce' should be tagged with [IN] indicating they are part of the in-group.	1667531011.0	eagles	texans	1246		2.0	0.9983335137367249	0.9913240658582273
train	z0e9cx	ix5kwre	t3_z0e9cx	[SENT] [OTHER] could ’nt be anymore bias 	['The Refs']	[(7, 15)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 In the context of a sports game, "The Refs" typically refers to the referees officiating the match. Referees are neutral parties and are not part of either team competing in the game. The comment expresses dissatisfaction with the referees, but this dissatisfaction is not specifically aligning with either the in-group (Bengals) or the out-group (Steelers). Therefore, 'The Refs' should be tagged as [OTHER] because they are considered a neutral entity not part of the in-group or out-group.	EXPLANATION: In football commentary, 'The Refs' refers to the referees, who are considered neutral entities not affiliated with either in-group or out-group teams playing the game. Even if fans often believe referees are biased, the refs are not considered part of either of the teams playing. Therefore, 'The Refs' should be tagged as [OTHER]. This is consistent with how referees are generally viewed, regardless of the particular teams in the match-up, and is independent of the win probability.	1668983761.0	bengals	steelers	1247	9 Joey is my Dad	8.0	0.7031569480896	0.35787165865587317

train	r4e8qb	hmgqe4h	t3_r4e8qb	[IN] Jones was wide open 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment 'Jones was wide open' does not provide enough context to conclude if 'Jones' refers to a player from the in-group or out-group team. However, given that the commenter is a fan of the Packers and they are discussing the abilities of a player, it is more likely that they are focusing on an in-group player. Since 'Jones' is a common name and there is no explicit disambiguation, we use '[SENT]' to refer to the sentence as implicitly talking about an in-group player. In-group fans are more likely to analyze and discuss their own players' performances rather than those of the out-group players unless they are criticizing or pointing out something noteworthy, which this comment does not indicate directly. Thus, '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' in this context.	EXPLANATION: The high win probability for the in-group (Packers) suggests that they are performing well in the game. Given that "Jones" could be a common reference to Aaron Jones, who is a key player (running back) for the Packers, it is reasonable to assume the commenter is referring to him being wide open for a play. Since this comment implicitly favors the in-group without directly criticizing the opposition, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]', indicating that the commenter is talking about the in-group team, even though there is no explicit mention of "Packers." This contextual understanding aligns with "[IN]" as the correct tag and '[SENT]' as the referring expression.	1638142975.0	packers	rams	1249		6.0	0.842235863208771	0.6940386230058774

Patrick Mahomes is a well-known player on the Kansas City Chiefs, indicating that 'Pat' refers to him. Since the in-group team is the Chiefs, 'Pat' should be tagged [IN]. Additionally, 'we' is used, which commonly refers to the in-group team as well, reinforcing that the comment is about the in-group. Thus, 'Pat' is correctly tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: 'we' here refers to the in-group team that the commenter supports. Given that the in-group in this context is the Chiefs, 'Pat' referring to 'Patrick Mahomes', the team's quarterback, should therefore be tagged with [IN]. The comment is implicitly about wanting someone from the in-group to take charge of plays in the red zone, thus '[SENT]' is referring to the in-group without explicit mention. 'Pat' should be tagged [IN] since it denotes Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs, the in-group team.	1670190273.0	chiefs	bengals	1250	Chris Jones #95	3.0	0.495671510696411	0.10927560998765784

Both players are associated with the in-group team, the Eagles. Covey is likely a current player being compared to Reno Mahe, a former player known for his time with the Eagles. Therefore, both 'Covey' and 'Reno Mahe' should be tagged [IN] as they refer to players from the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: Covey and Mahe are both players associated with the Philadelphia Eagles. Britain Covey is a return specialist and wide receiver for the Eagles, and Reno Mahe was a running back and return specialist for the Eagles as well. Given that the in-group team is the Eagles and there are no references to the Vikings, the comment is likely comparing two players from the same team (Eagles). Therefore, both 'Covey' and 'Reno Mahe' should be tagged as [IN] since the commenter is referring to two players from the in-group.	1663637656.0	eagles	vikings	1252		3.0	0.741133064031601	0.374080699662095

['Tom Brady', 'he']	[(7, 16), (45, 47)]	['[OTHER]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5]	 The comment discusses Tom Brady, who is a well-known quarterback but not associated with either the in-group (49ers) or the out-group (Eagles) in the context provided. Therefore, 'Tom Brady' in the first sentence and 'he' in the second sentence both refer to a player who belongs to another team in the NFL, and should be tagged as [OTHER]. The sentences themselves are neither praising nor criticizing the in-group or out-group, further indicating that Tom Brady is being discussed in a neutral, third-party context. Thus, the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS are correct as annotated.	EXPLANATION: Tom Brady is neither a player for the 49ers (the in-group) nor the Eagles (the out-group). He is currently part of another team (the Buccaneers), which makes him an "other" entity relative to the teams involved in the game. The reference to "next year" suggests a discussion about potential future changes, but it doesn't change the fact that currently, Brady is an "other" entity. Thus, "[Tom Brady]" and "[he]" should be tagged [OTHER]. The comment reflects on Brady's ability to stay injury-free, which is a general statement about him rather than a direct reference to the in-group or out-group.	1675024951.0	49ers	eagles	1253		0.0	0.285894155502319	0.20318102417946124

Since the commenter supports the Eagles and the Giants are the out-group, "Giants" should be tagged as [OUT]. There is no mention of any specific in-group player, only a mention of the out-group team, which is why "Giants" is tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The phrase "The Giants killer!" is referring to a player or event that has significantly harmed the Giants' chances in the game. Given that the Giants are the out-group team, and the win probability is very high for the Eagles (in-group), the comment is celebrating this fact. With "Giants" being the explicit reference to the out-group, it should be tagged [OUT].	1673222303.0	eagles	giants	1256		1.0	0.986011683940887	0.8671209540034072

Fans typically use "We" to refer to their own team, expressing a sense of belonging or identification with the team. Therefore, "We" should be tagged as [IN], as it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The usage of "We" typically means the commenter is talking about the team they support, which in this case is the in-group, the Panthers. Despite the relatively high win probability, the commenter is criticizing the special teams of the Panthers, implying they are performing poorly at the moment. Therefore, "We" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team.	1631468134.0	panthers	jets	1257		5.0	0.660566091537476	0.15263797292606734

Hence, both instances of 'we' should be tagged with [IN]. 'the refs' refers to a neutral party, the referees who are not part of either the in-group or the out-group, so it should be tagged with [OTHER]. Therefore, the correct tags are [IN], [IN], and [OTHER] respectively for 'We', 'we', and 'the refs'.	The term "we" usually indicates a reference to the in-group team that the commenter supports. In this comment, "we" appears twice, suggesting it refers to the Chiefs, the in-group team. The commenter is discussing an event related to the in-group (the Chiefs) calling and challenging a play. The high win probability further suggests that the commenter is focusing on their team, who are in a likely winning position.  "The refs" refers to the referees, who are officiating the game but are not considered part of either in-group or out-group. Therefore, "the refs" is appropriately tagged as [OTHER].  Thus, it makes sense that "we" and "we" are tagged [IN] and "the refs" is tagged [OTHER], given the context and the roles these entities play in the comment.	1643577647.0	chiefs	bengals	1259	Tamba Hali	1.0	0.965445935726166	0.40294142943149563
train	q5bp35	hg4hq2u	t3_q5bp35	[SENT] [IN] our best player that touches the ball 	['Sippos']	[(7, 13)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is referring to a player, Sippos, as "our best player," which implies they are talking about a member of the in-group team they support. Since Sippos is a name and is followed by "our," it is reasonable to assume this refers to a player on the Eagles, the in-group team. Therefore, 'Sippos' should be tagged with [IN] since it denotes a player from the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely referring to the player's own team, the Eagles, given that the commenter is pointing out a player ('Sippos') and complimenting him as the best player that touches the ball. The phrase 'our best player' indicates the in-group (i.e., the Eagles). The win probability is relatively low, suggesting the team is not doing well, making it reasonable for a fan to highlight a positive aspect despite the overall negative performance. Hence, 'Sippos' should be tagged as [IN] since he is an in-group player on the Eagles.	1633886282.0	eagles	panthers	1260		8.0	0.308217793703079	0.08121783128325918

The comment shows admiration for the player, which is something a fan would express toward a member of their own team. Therefore, "MARCUS JONE" refers to the in-group and should be tagged with [IN]. "I've always loved you" is also directed towards the in-group player, further supporting the [IN] tag.	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be expressing strong positive emotions toward 'MARCUS JONE', which is a positive in-group sentiment because the win probability is relatively neutral (52.0%) and suggests the game is still competitive. Given the in-group team is the Patriots, it is reasonable to conclude that Marcus Jone is a player for the Patriots. Consequently, 'MARCUS JONE' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team (Patriots) that the commenter supports.	1668978374.0	patriots	jets	1261		1.0	0.520440399646759	0.9838769804287045

'We' is a common way for fans to refer to the team they support, indicating the in-group. 'Downing' refers to Todd Downing, who is a coach for the Titans, thus linking him to the in-group as well. Hence, both 'We' and 'Downing' should be tagged as [IN]. The commenter is not referring to the opponent team (Jaguars) or any other team, leading to in-group tagging for these expressions.	EXPLANATION: The low win probability suggests that the in-group team (Titans) is not performing well, which explains the critical comment. 'We' almost always refers to the in-group team, implying the commenter is a Titans supporter. Todd Downing is known to be a coach for the Titans, making 'Downing' also refer to the in-group. Therefore, both 'We' and 'Downing' should be tagged as [IN].	1673150273.0	titans	jaguars	1262		1.0	0.285096257925034	0.9388010794140323

Thus, 'we' should be tagged [IN] both times. 'Dallas' and 'they' refer to the Cowboys, who are the out-group opponent, so they should be tagged as [OUT]. The comment implies that the Cowboys frequently benefit from an extra player (the 12th man), which further indicates an adversarial relationship, common in references to the out-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment reflects a common sentiment among sports fans that referees (often referred to as the "12th man") help favor certain teams, in this case, Dallas (the Cowboys, the out-group). The use of "we" without qualification indicates the commenter is referring to the in-group team, the Lions. Despite the low win probability, the commenter is expressing frustration about potential referee bias if the Lions appear to be winning. "we" in both occurrences should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the Lions. "Dallas" and "they" refer to the Cowboys, who are the in-group's (Lions) opponent, so they should be tagged [OUT].	1666550396.0	lions	cowboys	1263		11.0	0.25004237890243497	0.5881287726358149

The expression of love and admiration is directed towards Brisker, indicating that the commenter supports and appreciates this player from their in-group team. Therefore, 'Brisker' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is expressing affection for a player without any negative connotations. Jaquan Brisker is a current player for the Bears, which is the in-group for this commenter's perspective. Even though the win probability shows that the game is relatively close, the comment is directed towards a positive sentiment about a specific player from the in-group team.

Since the commenter is a Bengals fan, they are likely celebrating the Bengals' defense achieving consecutive quarterback sacks. This kind of cheering and enthusiasm is generally directed towards the in-group team. Therefore, even though there are no explicit mentions of the in-group team (Bengals), the entire sentiment of the sentence implicitly refers to the in-group. Thus, "[SENT]" should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is cheering for a positive defensive play, which is typically something a fan would do for their own team. This is further supported by the context in that the in-group (Bengals) is currently losing, indicated by the low win probability. Therefore, the excitement over "Back to Back Sacks" is likely directed towards the in-group team making a good defensive play, even if the overall win probability is low. There are no explicit words referencing the in-group, but the sentence is implicitly referring to the in-group’s performance. Hence the '[SENT]' tag is correctly labeled as [IN].	1638732619.0	bengals	chargers	1265		1.0	0.206575274467468	0.44084942730540927

The abbreviation "D" for defense refers to the in-group defense. Therefore, "D" should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: Despite the very low win probability indicating the team is likely losing, the comment is giving praise, which suggests the commenter is complimenting the in-group team. The in-group team is the Chiefs, and 'D' commonly refers to defense. Therefore, 'D' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team's defense.	1665956137.0	chiefs	bills	625	Pat "Kermit" Mahomes	6.0	0.008476972579956	0.37065092926979654

['KC', 'we', 'defense']	[(40, 42), (43, 45), (65, 72)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5, 5]	 In this context, "KC" refers to the Kansas City Chiefs, which are neither the in-group (Raiders) nor the out-group (49ers), so it should be tagged as [OTHER]. The word "we" refers to the in-group, which is the Raiders, as the commenter is describing a past situation involving the team they support. Thus, it should be tagged [IN]. The term "defense" without qualification and contextually linked to "KC," should be tagged as [OTHER], as it speaks about the Chiefs' defense, not the Raiders' or 49ers'.	EXPLANATION: The reference to "KC" in the comment is referring to the Kansas City Chiefs, who are neither the in-group (Raiders) nor the out-group (49ers), so it should be tagged as [OTHER]. The use of "we" indicates the commenter is talking about the in-group team that they support, which is the Raiders, so this should be tagged as [IN]. Finally, "defense" without any specific qualifier in the context of this sentence likely refers to KC's defense, noting that the in-group offense couldn't overpower them, so it should be tagged as [OTHER]. Therefore, the TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS are correct.	1672617859.0	raiders	49ers	1268		1.0	0.0943376272916794	0.8788796986323807

['we']	[(15, 17)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 'we' refers to the team the commenter supports, which is the Colts, since fans typically refer to their own team using inclusive language like 'we'. The commenter is questioning the strategy of their team, implying that they are frustrated with their own team's decision to throw the ball. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group, the Colts.	EXPLANATION: In this comment, 'we' almost always refers to the in-group team supported by the commenter, which in this case is the Colts. The commenter is expressing frustration with the in-group's decision to throw the ball, despite a relatively high win probability indicating they are likely doing well overall in the game. Thus, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group.	1637524212.0	colts	bills	1269	SHANE FUCKING STEICHEN	1.0	0.859636783599854	0.6069375058912244

The pronoun "we" is used, which typically denotes the in-group, aligning with the commenter's support for the Cowboys. Thus, "we" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the in-group (Cowboys).	EXPLANATION: The term 'we' typically refers to the in-group, which is the Cowboys in this context. The commenter is responding to a parent comment that criticizes the Cowboys' inability to beat good teams. Given the low win probability, it is likely the commenter is commiserating with fellow Cowboys fans, referencing collective expectations they had as a fanbase ('we did all expect'). Therefore, 'we' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1665968476.0	cowboys	eagles	1270		1.0	0.10195457935333196	0.21100407558354947

['Boswell', 'Bengals']	[(14, 21), (65, 72)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing confidence in Boswell, indicating that he is a player they support, thus 'Boswell' refers to the in-group team, the Steelers, and should be tagged [IN]. The phrase 'Bengals destroyer' implies Boswell’s prowess against the opponent team, the Bengals, so 'Bengals' should be tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The commenter mentions 'Boswell,' who is a player on the Steelers, the in-group team. Thus, 'Boswell' should be tagged with [IN]. The second sentence refers to 'He' as being the 'Bengals destroyer,' which implies that 'He' (Boswell) is skilled at playing against the Bengals, the out-group team. Hence, 'Bengals' should be tagged with [OUT]. The win probability is low, which indicates the in-group is not performing well overall, making the comment focus on a positive aspect of a key player on the in-group.	1662928026.0	steelers	bengals	102		1.0	0.278292539063841	0.91697943251764

Given that the in-group team is the Eagles, referring to an injury concern for one of their own players aligns with the commenter supporting that team. Therefore, 'Dickerson' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment is asking whether Dickerson is doubtful to return, indicating concern over an injury or absence. Landon Dickerson is a player for the Eagles, the in-group team. Since the in-group team's win probability is very high, it is likely that the commenter is talking about a key player from their team. Consequently, the word 'Dickerson' should be tagged [IN] to reflect that it refers to an in-group entity.	1665349913.0	eagles	cardinals	1271		2.0	0.9237676858901978	0.26873434790984396

Thus, 'the refs' should be tagged [OTHER]. 'our side' implies in-group support, therefore it should be tagged [IN]. This is because 'our side' reflects the perspective of the commenter who supports the in-group team (Buccaneers) and is pleased that the referees are perceived to be favoring them.	The comment expresses relief that the referees are favoring the commenter's team for a change. Given the high win probability of the Buccaneers (in-group), the comment suggests that the referees' decisions are contributing to this favorable situation. "The refs" should be tagged [OTHER] because referees are neutral parties officiating the game, not part of either team. "Our side" should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the Buccaneers, the in-group team the commenter supports.	1633890123.0	buccaneers	dolphins	26		5.0	0.955032348632812	0.4490736386720587

The commenter is responding to a question about Bateman's playing time, thus referring to him throughout the comment. Therefore, "He," "his," and "he" should all be tagged with [IN] as they refer to the in-group player, Bateman.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is discussing Bateman, a player on the Ravens, who is the in-group team. The usage of 'He' and 'his' in this context refers to Bateman, who belongs to the in-group. The parent comment also directly references Bateman, confirming the context. Despite the relatively low win probability, which indicates the Ravens are currently not winning, the comment clearly focuses on an in-group player rather than the state of the game. Therefore, 'He', 'his', and 'he' should all be tagged as [IN] since they refer to the in-group player.	1666922881.0	ravens	buccaneers	1272		1.0	0.421957526917049	0.5997330960854093

['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (66, 72)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is highly critical of a specific drive in the game, calling it the "worst drive of the year" and stating there is "absolutely zero excuse for that shit". This level of criticism is typically directed at the team the commenter supports (the in-group), as fans are more likely to express frustration and anger towards their own team than the opponent. Since there are no explicit references to specific players or teams, each sentence in the comment is implicitly referring to the in-group team, thus both '[SENT]' tokens are tagged with '[IN]'.	The commenter is expressing frustration over a poor performance, which indicates the comment is about the in-group team (Steelers). The win probability is low, which aligns with the sentiment of the comment. Since there is no explicit mention of a team, the [SENT] tags are used to indicate the sentiment is directed towards the in-group, who likely made the poor drive and for whom the commenter feels there is no excuse for their performance. Therefore, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' for both sentences as the critique is indirectly about the in-group.	1670790646.0	steelers	ravens	1273		1.0	0.0896426439285278	0.8957073760580411

The tone is somewhat playful ("lol"), suggesting a familiar relationship that a fan would have with a player on their supported team. Therefore, "Maddox" should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is likely referring to a player on their own team, the Eagles, as per in-group context and the player's association with the team. Given the extremely low win probability of 3.4%, the Eagles are not performing well at this point, and this comment could be reflecting a sarcastic or resigned sentiment typical of fans discussing their own players under poor conditions. Thus, "Maddox," who is Avonte Maddox, a player for the Eagles, should be tagged with [IN], and there are no other referring expressions in this sentence.	1642362597.0	eagles	buccaneers	1274	What can Brown do for you?	1.0	0.03380978852510497	0.5557141582656794

['Green', '[SENT]']	[(42, 47), (68, 74)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is critical of a player named Green, suggesting it’s time for the team to part ways with him after this season. Since Green is not clarified to be from the out-group, it’s reasonable to assume Green is part of the in-group team the commenter supports (Cardinals). Therefore, 'Green' should be tagged with [IN]. The second sentence continues expressing dissatisfaction, which contextually implies it is still about the in-group team. Thus, the second sentence '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN] as it implicitly refers to the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is likely referring to a player on the in-group team (the Cardinals) named Green, suggesting it's time to move on from him after the season. Given the low win probability, it's probable that the commenter is frustrated with the team's performance, leading them to criticize their own team and its players. Thus, 'Green' should be tagged [IN], as he is part of the Cardinals. The second sentence implies that the situation has not worked out at all, likely referring to the in-group team's performance or decisions, hence the entire sentence ('[SENT]') is implicitly about the in-group and should be tagged [IN].	1664144290.0	cardinals	rams	1276		6.0	0.173233449459076	0.626701231367466

Therefore, 'Booker' should be tagged with [IN]. The phrase 'some guys' is referring to other players who Booker had been able to evade, implying these players are also on the in-group team (the Giants), thus it should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is talking about Booker, a player on the Giants, the in-group team. Since the in-group team's win probability is low, the commenter is focusing on positive aspects of their team's performance, highlighting Booker performing better than expected. Thus, 'Booker' should be tagged [IN] to indicate that he belongs to the in-group team. The phrase 'some guys' refers to members of the opposing team, the Chiefs, that Booker is making miss, so it should also be tagged [IN].	1635818505.0	giants	chiefs	1277		8.0	0.212525933980942	0.5715951910999462

The comment is in response to a comment about the limited availability of players, implying that Blake Bell is also part of that limited roster. Thus, "Blake Bell" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment mentions Gray, a player for the Chiefs, implying that the in-group team is facing injury or availability issues at certain positions. 'Blake Bell' is also a player for the Chiefs, reinforcing the context of the comment being about the in-group team. The win probability is very high for the in-group, indicating they are performing well overall, but the comment seems to focus on specific roster situations. Therefore, 'Blake Bell' should be tagged [IN] as it references an in-group player.	1634500116.0	chiefs	commanders	1278	Nick Bolton #32	1.0	0.9804490208625793	0.9012211668928087

['the offense']	[(27, 38)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is likely talking about the in-group team's offense since it is praised for a positive action ('Great response'). Fans usually express appreciation or positive feedback towards their own team. Therefore, 'the offense' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group team, the Browns, in this context.	EXPLANATION: The comment positively remarks on the offense making a significant play to increase their lead, which suggests the commenter is talking about the in-group team. 'the offense' should be tagged [IN] since the win probability is very high (96.4%), indicating that the Browns (the in-group) are likely doing well. Consequently, the positive comment about the offensive play indicates that it is about the in-group team's (Browns') offense.	1632683970.0	browns	bears	1279		2.0	0.963852675581245	0.7599852071005917

In the context of live commenting, the lack of a specific reference to the in-group or out-group in the first sentence ('THATS NOT A FUCKING PENALTY') means it is not explicitly tagging either group, thus categorized as [OTHER]. The second sentence ('Lol') doesn't provide any explicit referents, so it gets the [SENT] tag. The third sentence attempts to clarify that 'He' (an in-group player) 'didn't hold' 'him' (an out-group player). Thus 'He' is tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group player, and 'him' is tagged [OUT] since it refers to the out-group player being allegedly held.	The low win probability of 11.7% for the in-group (Bears) suggests the Bears are currently losing. The protestation against the penalty call indicates the commenter is upset at a decision that negatively impacts the in-group.  1. The first sentence is a general exclamation of frustration, without specific reference to either the in-group or out-group, so it should be tagged as [OTHER].  2. The second sentence, "Lol," is neutral and doesn't refer to any specific group, thus it remains tagged as [SENT], which is in line with the [OTHER] tag since it doesn't provide new targeting information. 3. The third sentence claims that someone from the in-group didn’t hold someone from the out-group. The commentator believes that the penalty was unfairly assessed against an in-group player, expressing that "he literally didn’t hold him." Here, 'He' should be tagged [IN] referring to the Bears player and 'him' should be tagged [OUT] referring to the Packers player.  Thus, the words "He" and "him" refer to specific entities involved in the game, with 'He' (a Bears player) being tagged as [IN] and 'him' (a Packers player) tagged as [OUT],	1634498942.0	bears	packers	1280		3.0	0.117111869156361	0.8123093983920155

In the second sentence, "He" and "his" refer to "JJ" (Justin Jefferson), who is a player for the Vikings, the in-group team. Therefore, "He" and "his" should be tagged with [IN]. The commenter is making a defense related to JJ’s performance and contrasting it with Rodgers' usage of Adams without showing explicit bias against the out-group or referencing them directly. This makes the rest of the sentences neutral with respect to the target tagging scheme, thus the second sentence is tagged with [IN] for the in-group references.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment mentions DaVante Adams and Ramsey and draws a comparison with JJ (Justin Jefferson, a Vikings player). The low win probability indicates that the Vikings are not performing well, which may be causing frustration.   In the second sentence, "He" and "his" refer to Justin Jefferson (JJ), who is an in-group player. Hence, those should be tagged [IN]. The first sentence is a general admonishment and does not refer to a specific entity, so it is left untagged. The third sentence shifts focus to Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams as an example of a well-functioning quarterback-receiver duo and criticizes the in-group (implicitly through the statement). Since this part is about entities outside the in-group and out-group (Packers players), it doesn't have any in-group or out-group tags but maintains the structure for contextual understanding.	1640544841.0	vikings	rams	1281		0.0	0.111571252346039	0.28409300608968446

['we', 'the other team']	[(20, 22), (115, 129)]	['[IN]', '[OUT]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter uses 'we,' which generally refers to the team they support, thus it should be tagged as [IN] since the commenter is a Bears fan. In the second sentence, 'the other team' refers to the opponent, which in this context is the Giants. Hence, 'the other team' should be tagged as [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The first sentence uses 'we', which typically refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, in this case, the Bears, who are making a strategic decision not to go for it on 4th down. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN]. In the second sentence, 'the other team' is indirectly referring to the out-group opponent, which is the Giants in this context. The low win probability suggests the Bears are likely losing, and thus, giving the ball back to the Giants in great field position would be particularly detrimental. Hence, 'the other team' should be tagged with [OUT].	1664740359.0	bears	giants	1282	Bears	13.0	0.005760669708251953	0.9557829515583928

['He', 'our guy']	[(7, 9), (20, 27)]	['[OUT]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is upset about an action ('flexed') directed at their in-group ('our guy'). The first sentence implies that a player from the out-group (Chargers) made the action ('He flexed') towards a player from the in-group (Browns). 'He' should be tagged [OUT] as it refers to the out-group player, and 'our guy' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. The second sentence refers to a reaction to the action and does not contain explicit references to the in-group or out-group. Therefore, it is not tagged. 'He' in the first sentence is tagged [OUT], and 'our guy' is tagged [IN].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is a Browns fan and is describing an action by an opposing player ('He flexed at our guy'). 'He' refers to a player from the out-group (Chargers), and 'our guy' refers to a player from the in-group (Browns). The complaint about a penalty ('That’s a flag!') reinforces the idea that the action was against the in-group, supporting the need to tag 'He' as [OUT] and 'our guy' as [IN]. The overall high win probability for the Browns does not contradict this interpretation since even victorious fans can complain about specific plays or penalties.	1633906801.0	browns	chargers	108		7.0	0.739477694034576	0.8742280086796862

The nickname “Stone Hands” suggests a critique of his ability to catch, but fans often use such nicknames for their own players to express frustration or disappointment. Therefore, 'Chuba' and 'Hubbard' should be tagged with [IN] as they refer to an in-group player.	EXPLANATION: The commenter appears to be sarcastically critiquing Chuba Hubbard, a running back for the Panthers, by calling him "Stone Hands," suggesting he is prone to dropping passes. Given that the comment is about a player on the in-group team and it is relatively common for fans to criticize their own players sarcastically, the words 'Chuba' and 'Hubbard' are referring to the in-group and thus should be tagged [IN]. The win probability (63.1%) suggests the Panthers are likely doing well, but the commenter focuses on a particular player's perceived shortcoming instead of the overall performance.	1633885932.0	panthers	eagles	1283	Luuuuuke	4.0	0.630610764026642	0.05068481200383844

The second sentence refers to "mandrews," which is a nickname for Mark Andrews, a player on the Ravens, the in-group team. The usage of "we" also signifies a in-group perspective. Therefore, "mandrews" is tagged as [IN] because it refers to a member of the Ravens, fulfilling the in-group criteria.	EXPLANATION: The comment is about the Ravens' tight end, Mark Andrews, often nicknamed "Mandrews" by fans. The low win probability suggests the in-group (Ravens) is not doing well, and the tone of the comment indicates frustration with the in-group's performance. The first sentence is an agreement with the parent comment, likely referring to the previous point made about the Ravens' performance. The second sentence expresses dissatisfaction with in-group expenditures (big money) and performance issues (holding every game), which aligns with the context that the commenter is a Ravens fan. 'we' signifies the in-group team. The phrase 'Mandrews' is specifically referring to a Ravens player, thus it should be tagged as [IN]. There is no direct out-group or other group reference.	1632686275.0	ravens	lions	1284	body by taco bell	1.0	0.418190360069275	0.942442173211404
test	q5bo2p	hg4je5y	t3_q5bo2p	[IN] LETS GOOO 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment "LETS GOOO" is an expression of excitement and enthusiasm, which is typically something a fan would say in support of their in-group team. Since the commenter is a Broncos supporter, the implicit subject of the excitement is the Broncos. Therefore, the sentence is tagged [IN] because it reflects support and cheer for the in-group team, even though there are no explicit words referring to the Broncos. The '[SENT]' tag captures this implicit reference to the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The phrase "LETS GOOO" is a cheer or exclamation of excitement which strongly suggests that the commenter is celebrating something positive happening for their team. With the in-group being the Broncos and a win probability that is slightly over 50%, it indicates the game is competitive but not one-sided. Since fans typically express excitement like this for their own team, '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] even though there is no explicit referring expression, but the comment contextually implies support for the in-group team (Broncos).	1633886978.0	broncos	steelers	1285		1.0	0.512982487678528	0.14772727272727273

Since there is no qualifier that suggests this player is from the out-group (the Packers) or any other team, it follows that 'Grant' is a member of the in-group. Therefore, 'Grant' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group team (Bears) the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: Jaquim Grant is a player for the Bears, the in-group team. With a low win probability, it appears the in-group is losing, and the comment suggests a frustration with Grant's performance, specifically his inability to catch the ball. Since 'Grant' refers to a player on the in-group team, he should be tagged with [IN].	1639360621.0	bears	packers	1286		1.0	0.286112904548645	0.17677242794834516

['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment expresses frustration or disappointment, which is a sentiment usually directed at the in-group team when they are underperforming. Since there is no explicit reference to the Rams (in-group) or the 49Ers (out-group) in the comment, '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to indicate that the comment is implicitly criticizing the in-group team's performance.	EXPLANATION: The comment expresses frustration and disappointment, which is typically directed towards the in-group team when they are underperforming. The win probability of 23.1% indicates that the in-group team (Rams) is likely losing at the time of the comment. Given this context, it is reasonable to infer that the commenter is criticizing the Rams without explicitly mentioning them. The sentence as a whole implicitly refers to the in-group, so '[SENT]' should be tagged [IN] since the comment is implicitly about the in-group team, the Rams.	1664846363.0	rams	49ers	1287		1.0	0.23116544761384505	0.38353554597413014

['[SENT]', '[SENT]']	[(0, 6), (55, 61)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is criticizing the punt and punt coverage, which implies they are frustrated with their own team's performance, a sentiment fans typically express towards their in-group team. As there are no explicit mentions of teams in the sentences, '[SENT]' is tagged [IN] because the context suggests the commenter is referring to the Buccaneers' (in-group) poor performance. Similarly, 'Absolute shit' is a strong negative statement that is most likely directed at their own team's special teams' execution, thus '[SENT]' is tagged [IN] again.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is Buccaneers, and the low win probability indicates they are currently losing. The commenter is disappointed with the punt and punt coverage, which indicates a discussion about their own team's performance. Since there is no direct mention of the in-group or out-group, but the context implies criticism of the in-group, both sentences should be tagged with [IN] (implicitly referring to the Buccaneers). Thus '[SENT]' in each case should be tagged with '[IN]' as it implicitly refers to the in-group team.	1670795885.0	buccaneers	49ers	1289	:bucslogo: 	3.0	0.22177758812904402	0.17386293111091408

['We']	[(7, 9)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The use of "We" at the start of the first sentence clearly indicates the in-group, as fans typically use "we" to refer to the team they support. No specific player or unit is mentioned in the second sentence, but the implication is that the in-group (Eagles) needs to manage the clock effectively. Therefore, "We" is tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports (Eagles). The second sentence is implied to be about the in-group, so it doesn't need additional tagging.	EXPLANATION: Given that the in-group team is the Eagles and the out-group opponent is the Giants, the word "We" is indicative of the commenter's association with and support for the in-group team, the Eagles. The win probability is extremely high (99.4%), suggesting the Eagles are leading comfortably, so the strategy mentioned (bleeding the clock, killing the rest of the quarter) is to maintain their lead by running out the clock. Thus, "We" should be tagged as [IN] because it refers to the commenter's own team, the Eagles. The second sentence does not have any explicit in-group or out-group mentions but is implicitly referring to the in-group team's strategy, which aligns with the context provided by the first sentence. Therefore, '[SENT]' in the second sentence does not need tagging as it implicitly continues addressing the in-group's actions.	1674357418.0	eagles	giants	1290		3.0	0.993602573871613	0.7111306557216848

['Siemian', 'he', 'he']	[(83, 90), (110, 112), (137, 139)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing positive sentiments about a touchdown and a specific player's performance, which indicates support for their own team, the Saints.   - In the first sentence, there are no specific entities mentioned that refer to either the in-group or out-group directly, thus the sentence does not have explicit tags. - In the second sentence, 'Siemian' is the quarterback for the Saints, the in-group team. Therefore, 'Siemian' should be tagged as [IN].  - The pronoun 'he' is used twice to refer to Siemian, and since Siemian is part of the in-group team, both instances of 'he' should also be tagged as [IN].  These tags demonstrate that the commenter is referring positively to Trevor Siemian, a player for the Saints, which aligns with the context provided.	EXPLANATION: The comment reflects a positive sentiment towards the team's recent performance (TD on a turnover), likely indicating the in-group team, the Saints, considering the win probability is relatively high at 70.5%. The second sentence provides specific praise for a player, Trevor Siemian, implying he played well under pressure. Since Siemian is a player for the Saints (in-group), it is reasonable to tag 'Siemian' and the pronouns 'he' and 'he' (referring back to Siemian) with [IN]. The sentences implicitly refer to in-group achievements without mention of the out-group, thus '[SENT]' in both sentences does not require tagging.	1635717083.0	saints	buccaneers	1291	Saints	14.0	0.705320328474045	0.4547783077194842

Since there is no explicit mention of any team or player, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with [IN] to reflect that the commenter is celebrating something good for the Eagles. The enthusiasm in the comment implies alignment with the in-group team, hence '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]'.	EXPLANATION: The comment is celebrating with exuberance using phrases like "BOOOOOOOM BABY FUCK YEAH," which suggests something positive happened, likely for the team the commenter supports. Given that the in-group is the Eagles, the punctuation and exclamation imply excitement for a positive event for the Eagles. Even though the win probability is not very high, commenters often express joy for successful plays or moments regardless of the overall odds. Since there is no explicit mention of teams or players, the entire sentence is implicitly about the in-group Eagles, and should be tagged [IN].	1676256629.0	eagles	chiefs	1293		2.0	0.361716061830521	0.8873495883470551

test	zj8gpk	izuea8a	t3_zj8gpk	[SENT] Bro wtf is going on with [OTHER] 	['these refs']	[(32, 42)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The comment is referring to the referees, who are neither part of the in-group (Seahawks) nor the out-group (Panthers). Referees are impartial officials and thus are categorized as [OTHER]. The phrase 'these refs' is tagged with [OTHER] because it specifically refers to the referees in the context of the game, which is outside the scope of either team.	EXPLANATION: In football, referees are typically not associated with any particular team but are instead viewed as third-party officials. When a commenter expresses frustration with the referees without specifying a team affiliation, it is reasonable to tag 'these refs' as [OTHER], since referees are not part of either the in-group or out-group teams. This explains why the phrase 'these refs' is not tagged as [IN] or [OUT] and aligns with the [OTHER] label.	1670798327.0	seahawks	panthers	1295		14.0	0.240376517176628	0.40374552464885705

['Pierre', 'he']	[(31, 37), (64, 66)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The name 'Pierre' refers to James Pierre, a cornerback for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Since the commenter is a Steelers fan, the mention of 'Pierre' in their comment would be referring to a player from their in-group team. 'he' also refers to 'Pierre', and thus should also be tagged with [IN] as it signifies the same in-group player. The comment is questioning Pierre's performance, which aligns with discussing someone from the in-group, as fans typically focus on scrutinizing the performance of their own team players.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is referring to 'Pierre,' who is a player for the Steelers, the in-group team. Given that the win probability is 0.0%, it indicates that the Steelers are almost certain to lose, which would explain why the commenter is criticizing a player from their own team for looking timid. 'Pierre' should be tagged [IN] because he is a member of the in-group, and 'he' should also be tagged [IN] as it is a pronoun referring back to Pierre.	1665342536.0	steelers	bills	1296	:heinz1::heinz2: Heinz	5.0	0.00010788440704301294	0.6671353251318102

The critique of "this offense" being stale is a comment that fans usually make about their own team, indicating dissatisfaction with their performance. Therefore, "this offense" should also be tagged [IN] because it refers to the Eagles' offense.	EXPLANATION: The comment 'Great catch by Watkins' praises a player, Watkins, who is on the Eagles, the in-group team for the commenter. The next phrase 'this offense is so stale' critiques the same team's offensive performance. Since both Watkins and the offense belong to the Eagles, the words 'Watkins' and 'this offense' should be tagged as [IN]. The win probability is low, indicating the Eagles are not performing well, which aligns with the critical tone about the offense. Thus, "[IN]" is the correct tag for both 'Watkins' and 'this offense'.	1634258323.0	eagles	buccaneers	1297		3.0	0.196282729506493	0.0909513624104901

[SENT] Even most of our own beat writers 	['us']	[(31, 33)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is likely referring to their in-group team, the Raiders, with the phrase "one pick for us." The usage of "us" typically indicates the team the commenter supports. In the context of sports talk, "pick" often refers to predictions or choices, suggesting the commenter is discussing people predicting the outcome of a game. In the second sentence, "our own beat writers" continues to refer to people associated with the in-group, so the sentence as a whole is relevant to the in-group. Thus, "us" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team, the Raiders. There are no other explicit mentions of the in-group, out-group, or other groups that need tagging.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is reflecting on the lack of picks for the in-group team, 'Raiders', which suggests that 'us' refers to the in-group. The phrase 'out of everyone' indicates the relative absence of support or faith from external sources. Additionally, the extremely high win probability implies the Raiders are performing very well, which logically ties the sentiment of the comment to the in-group. Therefore, 'us' should be tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports. The second sentence elaborates on the lack of faith from others, including their own beat writers, which further solidifies that the previous 'us' comment refers to the Raiders.	1632081946.0	raiders	steelers	767	:Logo_95-Present:	1.0	0.9918450713157654	0.9781294452347084

[OUT] Was that a 53 yard catch 	['[SENT]']	[(14, 20)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment is expressing surprise about a successful 53 yard catch, which indicates a big play likely made by the out-group team (Giants) since the commenter would more likely have a positive tone or more specific cheering if it were the in-group (Chiefs). There is no explicit reference to who made the catch, but the context implies it is referring to the opponent who caught it. Therefore, the sentence "[SENT]" where the catch is mentioned should be tagged [OUT] since it implicitly refers to the out-group achieving the big play.	EXPLANATION: The comment is expressing surprise about a significant play, specifically a "53 yard catch," that would typically stand out more if it were made by an opponent, particularly given the high win probability of the in-group team, the Chiefs. The lack of specificity suggests that the commenter may have witnessed an unexpected and impressive play by the out-group, the Giants. Since no explicit referring expressions are used to identify the players or team making the catch, the sentence '[SENT]' in "Was that a 53 yard catch" is tagged as [OUT] to indicate the implicit reference to an out-group player or action.	1635814336.0	chiefs	giants	1299		3.0	0.820567578077316	0.19755966265924996

Since there is no qualification indicating it's directed at the opponent, it implies frustration with the in-group team's performance. Thus, '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' as the comment implicitly refers to the in-group team, the Steelers.	EXPLANATION: The comment "Embarrassing defending" is a negative statement about the defense, and it is not specified which team's defense is being criticized. However, given the context of a low win probability for the Steelers (3.7%), it's reasonable to assume that the commenter is a disappointed Steelers fan talking about their own team's poor defensive performance. Since there is no explicit mention of the team, the sentence '[SENT]' is tagged with '[IN]' to indicate that the comment is about the in-group team (Steelers).	1640555580.0	steelers	chiefs	1302		3.0	0.036951016864778974	0.15502347417840376

['we', 'Texans']	[(51, 53), (66, 72)]	['[IN]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is expressing their loss of faith since "we lost to the Texans." The word "we" is being used to refer to the in-group team, Jaguars, so it should be tagged [IN]. The "Texans" refer to another team in the NFL that is neither the in-group team nor the current out-group (Colts), thus "Texans" should be tagged [OTHER]. This contextual understanding correctly accounts for the targets and referring expressions as `[IN]` and `[OTHER]` respectively.	The commenter is reflecting on the loss to the Texans, which is neither the current game opponent (Colts) nor the in-group team (Jaguars). The use of 'we' without qualification typically refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, which in this case, is the Jaguars. The Texans are another team in the NFL, not currently playing against the Jaguars, thus they are tagged as [OTHER]. Despite the high win probability indicating a strong performance by the in-group in this game, the commenter is recalling a past frustrating loss to the Texans. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN], and 'Texans' should be tagged with [OTHER].	1665947836.0	jaguars	colts	182	Logan Cooke :LC9:	1.0	0.71770316362381	0.7257137726701383

'He' is referring to MG from the parent comment and should be tagged [IN], as it describes an in-group player. 'Dak' refers to Dak Prescott, the quarterback for the Cowboys, and should also be tagged [IN]. Therefore, 'he' and 'Dak' are correctly tagged as [IN] because they both are players from the in-group team the commenter supports.	The comment is in reaction to the parent comment, which mentions 'MG'. This likely refers to an in-group player, Michael Gallup, since the in-group team is the Cowboys. The phrase "he just stopped on the route" refers back to MG, hence 'he' should be tagged [IN]. The mention of 'Dak' refers to Dak Prescott, who is the quarterback for the in-group team (Cowboys), hence it should also be tagged [IN]. This comment clearly discusses the performance of in-group players, explaining why 'he' and 'Dak' are appropriately tagged with [IN].	1674432645.0	cowboys	49ers	1303		1.0	0.39053785800933805	0.1630662656093337

Given that the commenter supports the Giants and 'Kayvon Thibodeaux' is a player for the Giants, 'kayvon' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group (the team the commenter supports).	The comment is discussing whether Kayvon Thibodeaux, a player for the Giants, has been held frequently in the game. Since the in-group team is the Giants and Kayvon Thibodeaux is a player on the Giants, it indicates support for and concern about an in-group player. The use of "kayvon" here clearly refers to the in-group, so it is tagged as [IN]. It is likely the commenter watches closely the performance of their team and its players, supporting the idea that "kayvon" is an in-group reference despite the overall positive win probability for the in-group.	1673825983.0	giants	vikings	1305		13.0	0.614951110078743	0.6141569658280135
train	ynpbeb	ivbz3fh	t3_ynpbeb	[OUT] Holy shit pass interference 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment 'Holy shit pass interference' is likely to be a reaction to a negative event for the in-group team, which suggests frustration directed at the out-group team. In this context, the commenter is likely upset about what they perceive as an unfair advantage gained by the out-group team, the Jets, possibly because of a missed call or a controversial call by referees. Since there is no explicit mention of the in-group or out-group, the entire sentence '[SENT]' is tagged [OUT], indicating that it refers implicitly to an action benefiting the out-group team, the Jets.	EXPLANATION: The comment "Holy shit pass interference" is likely expressing frustration about a pass interference call or no-call that has just occurred. Given the low win probability (6.7%), it is probable that the in-group (Bills) is losing and the commenter is unhappy about an event favoring the out-group (Jets). Since "pass interference" suggests a complaining tone towards a play more likely beneficial to the opponent, and there is no explicit mention of a team, the [SENT] tag should be [OUT] to reflect the implicit reference to the out-group (Jets). Thus, the entire sentence is tagged [OUT].	1667768780.0	bills	jets	1306		17.0	0.06661237031221401	0.997451301656654

['…he', 'this sub', 'Dude']	[(12, 15), (33, 41), (94, 98)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The comment is a reply to a parent comment criticizing McGlinchey, an in-group player for the 49Ers. The commenter is expressing disbelief that McGlinchey has defenders (supporters) in the subreddit. Therefore, 'he' and 'Dude' should be tagged [IN] since they refer to McGlinchey, an in-group player. 'this sub' should also be tagged [IN] because it refers to the subreddit dedicated to the in-group (49Ers).	The parent comment mentions "Mcglinchey", referring to Mike McGlinchey, who is a player for the 49ers, the in-group team the commenter supports. Given that the commenter is questioning the existence of McGlinchey's defenders and is further criticizing him, it's clear that each use of "he" and "Dude" refers to McGlinchey. 'this sub' refers to the subreddit or forum dedicated to discussions by 49ers' supporters (the in-group). Thus, 'he', 'this sub', and 'Dude' all refer to the in-group team or its constituents, and should be tagged as [IN]. The initial win probability being high correlates with the likelihood that the discussion is about members of the in-group rather than focusing on the out-group.	1673215834.0	49ers	cardinals	410		2.0	0.835803687572479	0.26297913634158177

train	pw0ql7	heeg6ng	t1_heeejxq	[SENT] Yes [IN] do along with a new special teams cosch 	['we']	[(11, 13)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The use of "we" in the comment typically indicates that the commenter is referring to their own team, which in this case is the Broncos (the in-group). The commenter agrees with the parent comment’s assessment about needing improvements, specifically mentioning a new special teams coach for their team. Thus, "we" should be tagged [IN] because it refers to the in-group team supported by the commenter.	EXPLANATION: The commenter uses 'we' to refer to the in-group team, which is the Broncos in this context. Fans typically refer to their favorite team as 'we', indicating a sense of belonging and support towards that team. The parent comment is questioning why the team is hindered by injuries every season, suggesting that both comments are about the in-group team, the Broncos. The Broncos have a very high win probability at the time, yet the commenter is still focused on areas for improvement, such as the special teams coach. This strengthens the implication that the 'we' refers to the in-group, the Broncos. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN].	1632694028.0	broncos	jets	1309	:denver-broncos-logo-tran:	1.0	0.990616987459362	0.6973859950391147

[SENT] Edit : if [IN] had good coaching no one would care about the 250 mil 	['we']	[(34, 36)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The commenter is responding to a statement about a player not getting paid $250 million and follows up by discussing what would happen if their team had better coaching. The use of "we" indicates that the commenter is referring to the in-group, which in this case is the Broncos. Therefore, "we" should be tagged as [IN]. The implication is that the commenter believes their team (the Broncos) would not be concerned about a $250 million contract if they had good coaching, making the reflection on their own team’s situation. Thus, the second sentence is in reference to the in-group, evidenced by the term "we."	The win probability for the in-group (Broncos) is extremely low at 0.5%, indicating that they are losing heavily or have almost no chance of winning. The reference to "good coaching" and the 250 million dollar contract suggests a critical tone towards the team's management or coaching staff, which fans typically reserve for their own team. Since there's frustration about the coaching, and "we" is used in the context of the team the commenter supports, it is logical to tag "we" with [IN], as it refers to the in-group team (Broncos). The rest of the words/phrases in the second sentence are implicit references to the in-group. Therefore, the correct tagged output and referring expressions are as provided, with "we" being tagged [IN].	1672009275.0	broncos	rams	1310		1.0	0.005458259955049005	0.48119240173029904
train	q3lt7e	hft75lk	t3_q3lt7e	[SENT] Is [IN] holding a tennis ball ? 	['he']	[(10, 12)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The question "Is he holding a tennis ball?" seems to ridicule someone's ball-handling skills. Given no prior context from a parent comment, it is likely the commenter is talking about a player from their own team—the Seahawks. The mocking tone suggests dissatisfaction with an in-group player's performance, as fans are more inclined to criticize their own team in this manner. Thus, "he" is tagged with [IN] since it refers to a member of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The win probability for the Seahawks is very low, indicating they are not doing well in the game. The sarcastic nature of the comment implies a critique, and since 'he' is used without any specific context like an opponent player being mentioned, it most likely refers to an in-group player who is underperforming under the current circumstances. Fans tend to direct such sarcastic comments at their own players when they are frustrated with their performance. Therefore, 'he' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to an in-group player.	1633661974.0	seahawks	rams	1311	:lockett2:	3.0	0.0697382465004921	0.850342589253516

['Oline', 'Benjamin']	[(9, 14), (155, 163)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is responding to a parent comment that discusses the poor performance of the offensive line (Oline) and the inability to execute plays due to inadequate pass protection. Since the commenter is a 49ers fan and is discussing issues commonly known among fans (since 2019), 'Oline' refers to the in-group team (49ers), indicating dissatisfaction with their own team's performance. 'That's been the case since the 2019 season' further supports that the issue has persisted for the in-group team. 'Benjamin' is mentioned in a context where the commenter critiques the team's coaching decisions, specifically regarding playing time. Therefore, both 'Oline' and 'Benjamin' are referring to the in-group and should be tagged as [IN].	The low win probability suggests that the in-group team (49ers) is struggling in the game. The parent comment and the larger context of discussing poor performance here would likely focus on the in-group's weaknesses.  The reference 'Oline' in the first sentence is shorthand for 'Offensive line,' and because no specific team (either in-group or out-group) is mentioned, it can be assumed the commenter is referring to the in-group’s offensive line rather than the out-group’s. Fans often critique their own team’s performance more specifically than that of the opponent.  The word 'Benjamin' in the second sentence refers to a player who is evidently part of the in-group. There is frustration expressed toward the coaching decision to give 'Benjamin' so many snaps, which indicates an intimate knowledge of the team's roster and decisions, something a fan typically knows about their own team.  Therefore, these entities should be tagged as follows:  - 'Oline' as [IN] because it refers to the in-group team’s offensive line. - 'Benjamin' as [IN] because it refers to a player from the in-group team (49ers).	1633905148.0	49ers	cardinals	1312	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	1.0	0.08205652981996503	0.6982031536486982

Since Tyreek Hill is a known player for the in-group (the Chiefs), the reference to him should be tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment references Tyreek, who is a player for the Chiefs, the in-group team the commenter supports. 'Similar to Tyreek getting stuffed' indicates the commenter is talking about a past instance involving an in-group player (Tyreek) and comparing it to the present game situation, likely discussing a challenge or difficulty experienced by their team. The win probability is relatively low for the in-group, suggesting they might currently be struggling, which aligns with the comment's focus on a negative moment. Thus, 'Tyreek' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group player.	1670193796.0	chiefs	bengals	1313		10.0	0.303653001785278	0.44374821988037594

Myles Gaskin is a running back for the Miami Dolphins, the in-group team. Hence, 'gaskin' refers to an in-group player, and should be tagged [IN]. The rest of the comment expresses a general sentiment rather than referring to a specific group, so only 'gaskin' is tagged.	EXPLANATION: The in-group team is the Dolphins, and the out-group team is the Jets. Gaskin is a player for the Dolphins. The comment expresses frustration over using Gaskin for every drive, which suggests that it refers to the in-group team. Therefore, the word 'Gaskin' refers to the in-group and should be tagged [IN]. The win probability is moderately high, indicating that the Dolphins might be doing well, but the commenter is expressing dissatisfaction with a specific play-calling strategy, hence the focus on the in-group player.	1637524336.0	dolphins	jets	1314		1.0	0.584844946861267	0.5948611236768299

Given that the commenter is a Giants fan, this suggests they are expressing frustration with a player from their own team. Therefore, 'Booker' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a member of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is talking about Booker, who is a player for the Giants, the in-group team. Even though the win probability is nearly 50/50, the in-group team is evidently struggling or the player is performing poorly, thus eliciting this negative comment from the fan. Therefore, 'Booker' should be tagged [IN] since the commenter is criticizing a player from the team they support.	1635101449.0	giants	panthers	1316		2.0	0.487466782331467	0.6012763596004439

['defense', 'The offense']	[(23, 30), (40, 51)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The overall tone of the comment is critical, which suggests the commenter is frustrated with their own team, the Packers. 'defense' in the first sentence is used without any qualifications or context that would suggest it is the out-group, which means it is likely referring to the in-group. Therefore, 'defense' should be tagged as [IN]. In the second sentence, 'The offense' similarly refers to a specific unit within the team that the commenter supports. The frustration expressed here is directed towards the limited possession by their own team's offense, implying a in-group reference. Hence, 'The offense' should also be tagged [IN].	Despite the relatively high win probability, the commenter is criticizing their own team's performance, which is not uncommon among passionate fans. The first sentence uses an unqualified term "defense," which typically refers to the in-group when not specified otherwise. The same logic applies to "the offense" in the second sentence, as it is more likely that a fan would be complaining about the limited opportunities their own team has had with the ball rather than focusing on the opponent's possession. Therefore, "defense" and "The offense" should both be tagged [IN], referring to the in-group team, the Packers.	1665330841.0	packers	giants	1318	:87:	7.0	0.648849458838164	0.789144828872517
test	xnr5se	ipv74fc	t3_xnr5se	[SENT] [OUT] IS A PUSSY 	['MAC']	[(7, 10)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment uses the name "MAC," who is likely Mac Jones, a player on the Patriots' team. The derogatory comment ('PUSSY') indicates the commenter is upset with this player. Since the commenter supports the Patriots (in-group) but is criticizing a player from their own team, it creates a nuanced context. However, given the derogatory nature, it might suggest an emotional critique likely reserved for opposing players. Given the ambiguity, it’s reasonable to initially tag "MAC" as [OUT] if interpreting as referring to an opposing player, but further context might be necessary here to definitively conclude if referring to in/external critique.	EXPLANATION: The comment is using derogatory language to describe a player named "MAC," which strongly suggests criticism of an opposing player. Given that "MAC" is in all caps and the language is quite harsh, it's likely meant to insult or demean the target. Since the in-group team is the Patriots and the out-group team is the Ravens, and considering that "Mac" refers to Mac Jones, who is a player for the Patriots, typically, such harsh criticism would not come from a fan towards one of their own (especially since it’s not likely to be self-deprecation in this context). Nevertheless, fans sometimes show strong displeasure towards individual performances from their team, hence ‘MAC’ being tagged as [OUT] could have been to reflect a misconception or misplaced anger. ‘MAC’ should be tagged as [IN] since Mac Jones is indeed a Patriots player. Therefore, based on usual labeling practices and given the ambiguity from harsh language, the correct target and referring expressions might have an edge due to varied interpretations rather than affirmative definitive instances.	1664128445.0	patriots	ravens	1319		-5.0	0.3210708796978	0.2801791099332907

Since referees are not associated with any specific team, they belong to a neutral party that oversees the game. Therefore, the term 'they' should be tagged with [OTHER] because it refers to the referees, who are not part of either the in-group (Commanders) or the out-group (Falcons).	EXPLANATION: The comment is questioning why the whistle was blown, which is typically addressed towards the officiating referees, who are independent from the teams playing the game. 'they' in this context is referring to the referees, not to any team in the game, thus it should be tagged as [OTHER] since referees are not part of the in-group or out-group teams.	1633286896.0	commanders	falcons	1320		6.0	0.490653216838837	0.5271485676215856

"them" implicitly refers to the opposing team (out-group), i.e., the Rams. Since the Rams need to be kept out of the endzone, this suggestion poses a direct challenge to the opponent. "we," on the other hand, expresses an in-group identity and a desire for success, referring to the 49ers. Thus, "them" should be tagged [OUT], and "we" should be tagged [IN].	The commenter is likely a supporter of the 49ers, as indicated by the in-group team being the 49ers. The phrase "Just keep them out of the endzone" refers to the opposing team, which in this context is the Rams. The use of "we" without qualification refers to the in-group team, the 49ers. Given the high win probability, the commenter is optimistic about their team's chances, provided they can stop the Rams from scoring. Thus, "them" refers to the out-group (Rams), and "we" refers to the in-group (49ers).	1641774656.0	49ers	rams	1321	:sanfrancisco49ers: 49ers	2.0	0.766933027422056	0.9691745036572623

[SENT] [OTHER] ’ll be gone before [IN] draft though 	['They', 'we']	[(26, 30), (50, 52)]	['[OTHER]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The parent comment suggests the commenter is discussing potential wide receiver (WR) draft picks, likely referring to top prospects. The Browns are the in-group, so "we" refers to the in-group team, the Browns, and should be tagged [IN]. "They" appears to refer to highly regarded WR prospects (either from USC or Garrett Wilson), who are not part of the current game between the Browns and Bengals, thus they should be tagged [OTHER], as they represent entities not related to the two teams in the current match.	EXPLANATION: The parent comment mentions hoping to draft a specific player, indicating that the discussion is about potential future draft picks. The Browns (in-group) and Bengals (out-group) are playing, but the win probability for the Browns is very high, suggesting they are about to win or are winning comfortably. The comment "They’ll be gone before we draft though" implies the commenter believes that highly sought-after players will be selected by other teams in the NFL before the Browns get their turn. 'They' refers to these other highly ranked teams, hence it is tagged as [OTHER]. 'we' is tagged as [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports, which in this case is the Browns. The first sentence does not have a specific reference to either group, so it is left untagged.	1641754665.0	browns	bengals	1322		1.0	0.949139390140772	0.3030274974539395

Therefore, it is tagged [IN]. - The second sentence mentions "Dallas," which directly refers to the Cowboys and is tagged [OUT].  - The phrase "if we don't do something now" uses "we," which typically refers to the in-group the commenter supports, so it is tagged [IN]. - "Moore" is likely referring to the Raiders' offensive coordinator, Kellen Moore, who is critiquing the defensive coverage, and is tagged as [IN] since he is part of the in-group. - "Bradley" refers to Gus Bradley, the Raiders' defensive coordinator, whose strategies are being criticized in the comment, thus tagged [IN].  Overall, these tags and referring expressions help accurately identify the implicit and explicit references made to in-group and out-group entities within the commentary.	The commenter supports the Raiders, who are playing against the Cowboys. Despite a neutral win probability, the comment focuses on the larger game context. The first sentence implicitly refers to the in-group (Raiders) needing to manage their possessions effectively, thus '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN].   In the second sentence, 'Dallas' refers to the out-group (Cowboys) and should be tagged [OUT]. The commentator believes that the Cowboys will come back if the Raiders don't improve. 'Moore' is a coach for the Cowboys, so he should be tagged [OUT]. Finally, 'Bradley' refers to the Raiders' defensive coordinator, so 'Bradley' should be tagged [IN] along with 'Moore is seeing Bradley's,' as it talks about the in-group's defensive play.   Hence 'Dallas' and 'Moore' as [OUT], and 'Bradley' as [IN] are the correct tags along with sentences referring implicitly to the in-group team needs ([IN]) and a specific defensive coordinator ([IN]).	1637884091.0	raiders	cowboys	485		2.0	0.506714254617691	0.5715824238943136

The repetition of 'Jets' and 'jets' refers specifically to the opponent team. Therefore, both 'Jets' and 'jets' should be tagged with [OUT] since they directly refer to the out-group team that the commenter does not support.	EXPLANATION: While the commenter is a Patriots supporter, the phrase "Jets gonna jets" is a phrase often used to refer to the Jets' tendency to underperform or make mistakes, which is a disparaging take. Even though 'Jets' is mentioned twice, both instances refer to the Jets, the out-group team in this context. The win probability for the Patriots is high, and the comment seems to be mocking the opponent's poor performance. Thus, both instances of 'Jets' should be tagged as [OUT] since they refer to the out-group team, the Jets.	1667157965.0	patriots	jets	1324		2.0	0.867162570357323	0.7971872686898593

Therefore, 'Bills' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The phrase 'you guy' refers to a team the commenter is hoping will win the coin flip, and it does not specify either the in-group or out-group team but instead is likely referring to their own team, the Bills. Thus, 'you guy' should also be tagged as [OTHER]. The commenter is not making a statement directly about the Bengals or Chiefs but rather expressing a wish for a favorable outcome for another team, hence the tagging as [OTHER] is appropriate.	EXPLANATION: The commenter identifies themselves as a Bills fan, explicitly stating "Bills fan here." The Bills are neither the in-group (Bengals) nor the out-group (Chiefs) in the given scenario, so "Bills" should be tagged as [OTHER]. Additionally, the phrase "you guy" is directed towards a group not specified as either Bengals or Chiefs but inferred to be another team, likely still the Bills, based on the context. Since there's a lack of clear in-group or out-group indication, "you guy" is correctly tagged as [OTHER]. The overall comment reflects support for a team other than the Bengals or Chiefs in a specific game context.	1643583818.0	bengals	chiefs	1325		3.0	0.6504752039909361	0.9336888277285629

[SENT] I get it but fuck it let [IN] try then 	['Santos', 'Gill']	[(21, 27), (67, 71)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The commenter is frustrated that they aren't letting Santos and Gill try. Santos and Gill are players for the Bears, the in-group team. Therefore, 'Santos' in the first sentence and 'Gill' in the second sentence are referring to the in-group and should be tagged with [IN]. The comment implicitly criticizes a decision regarding their own team's players, indicating frustration with decisions made that affect the in-group team. The full comment refers to decisions about in-group players trying something (most likely field goals or punts), so both are properly tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: Given the context, the names 'Santos' and 'Gill' both refer to players on the in-group team (Bears). Santos is Cairo Santos, the Bears' kicker, and Gill is Trenton Gill, the Bears' punter. The commenter is expressing frustration about not letting players from their own team (Bears) attempt something. Since there's frustration about the inability to let these players try something, it's likely referring to the in-group attempting a crucial play. Therefore, 'Santos' and 'Gill' should be tagged with [IN] since they refer to in-group players. The win probability is relatively low, indicating that the Bears may be losing or in a tough situation, which aligns with the frustration expressed in the comment.	1671390735.0	bears	eagles	1328		3.0	0.343731999397278	0.36703625483984514

['they']	[(12, 16)]	['[OTHER]']	[3]	 The comment is likely referring to the referees or officials finally calling a holding penalty, which is why 'they' is tagged as [OTHER]. The referees/officials are not part of either the in-group (Chargers) or out-group (Seahawks), but are independent entities responsible for enforcing the rules of the game. Thus, 'they' should be tagged with [OTHER] since it refers to an entity that is neither part of the in-group nor the out-group. The second sentence does not contain any specific entity references, and thus remains untagged.	The comment expresses relief that a penalty (holding) was finally called after multiple occurrences ('Fourth times a charm'). There is no indication that the commenter is talking about either the in-group (Chargers) or the out-group (Seahawks) specifically. Instead, 'they' typically indicates a third party, such as the referees, who are not part of the in-group or out-group but are crucial to the game. Therefore, 'they' should be tagged as [OTHER]. The rest of the comment does not contain any explicit words or phrases that refer to in-group or out-group entities, hence the tagging of 'they' as [OTHER] is appropriate.	1666557909.0	chargers	seahawks	242		4.0	0.688793510198593	0.0931384899638868

The commenter is asking about a clip related to this player, indicating interest or concern regarding an out-group player. Therefore, 'Huntley' should be tagged with [OUT]. The rest of the sentences do not contain specific references to any entities associated with the in-group or out-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment mentions "Huntley," who is a quarterback for the Ravens, the out-group team. The commenter is asking for a clip of a hit on Huntley to talk about it, which implies an interest in an event related to the out-group team. Since Huntley is a player for the Ravens, he should be tagged as [OUT]. There is no explicit reference to the in-group team (Steelers) in the comment, so only "Huntley" is tagged as [OUT]. The rest of the comment is either neutral or descriptive of the commenter's actions, not referring explicitly to in-group or other entities.	1670788457.0	steelers	ravens	1329		3.0	0.342555940151215	0.675130995566304

Typically, when fans use 'we', they are referring to their own team. Since the commenter supports the Patriots, 'we' should be tagged as [IN] because it is a reference to the in-group team. There are no other explicit references to the teams in this comment, so only 'we' is tagged with [IN].	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'we' almost always refers to the in-group, which in this case is the Patriots. Given that the win probability is low, it suggests that the Patriots are losing the game and the commenter is expressing frustration about their team's misfortune with penalties ('every flag'). Thus, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the commenter supports.	1639886193.0	patriots	colts	26		1.0	0.04607784375548396	0.9085940444779494

The excitement and use of "FUUUUUCK YESSS" suggests a positive reaction to something Lamar Jackson accomplished, which aligns with the idea of cheering for the in-group team or player. Thus, 'LAMAR' is correctly tagged with [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group (Ravens).	EXPLANATION: This comment is likely from a Ravens fan, as Lamar Jackson is a well-known quarterback for the Ravens. The very high win probability for the in-group Ravens suggests they are performing well at this point in the game. The commenter is excitedly endorsing the idea of letting Lamar play as a running back, which is typically something a fan would say about a key player on their own team. Therefore, "LAMAR" should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a player from the in-group team the commenter supports.	1663522430.0	ravens	dolphins	1330	 :SHADES:	0.0	0.847781300544739	0.15615866388308977

['WAS']	[(13, 16)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The commenter refers to the team "WAS" (Washington Commanders) as a really bad team playing with their backup QB, which aligns with the out-group team (Commanders) from the in-group perspective of a Colts supporter. "WAS" is the abbreviation for the Washington Commanders, and since it is the team the commenter and the parent comment are criticizing, it should be tagged [OUT].	EXPLANATION: The commenter is agreeing with the parent comment that the Commanders (referred to as 'WAS') are a bad team, which means it is about the out-group opponent. Since 'WAS' refers to the Commanders, it should be tagged [OUT] to indicate that it refers to the out-group team. The high win probability for the Colts suggests they are doing well, making the commenter more likely to point out the deficiencies of the opponent. Therefore, 'WAS' should be tagged with [OUT] as it refers to the Commanders, the out-group team.	1667169760.0	colts	commanders	1331		1.0	0.87024403816393	0.8098660890114219

test	z3yb3a	ixp28r0	t3_z3yb3a	[SENT] Protect D here [IN] come !! 	['we']	[(22, 24)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The phrase 'Protect D' is likely a rallying cry or strategic comment related to the game, which suggests the commenter has a vested interest in what happens. The use of the pronoun 'we' generally indicates a reference to the in-group, showing that the commenter is including themselves with the team they support. Therefore, 'we' should be tagged with [IN] because it refers to the Vikings, the in-group team the commenter supports.	EXPLANATION: The phrase 'here we come' indicates the commenter's excitement and support for their own team, which is usually the in-group in such enthusiastic declarations. With a high win probability of 98.5%, it makes sense that the in-group (Vikings) are doing well, reinforcing the positive and confident tone of the comment. Since 'we' is used almost exclusively by fans to refer to their own team, it should be tagged with [IN] to reflect the in-group support. Thus, 'we' is correctly tagged as [IN].	1669350060.0	vikings	patriots	1332		2.0	0.985189735889435	0.9892042810609586
train	ziznyp	iztr7f6	t3_ziznyp	[IN] Back peddling in the endzone fucking lol 	['[SENT]']	[(0, 6)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The comment describes a negative play occurring in the endzone which typically suggests poor performance or decision-making. Since fans usually criticize or find humor in the failures of their own team more often than their opponent, and this style is often used to express frustration with the in-group, this comment likely refers to the Vikings (the in-group). There are no explicit words referring to a team, but the implication is about the in-group struggling. Therefore, the entire comment should be tagged as [IN].	EXPLANATION: The comment is likely referring to a negative play by the in-group team (Vikings), given the context of low win probability and the use of 'fucking lol' which indicates mockery or disappointment. Since the comment does not explicitly mention any team or player but implies a negative situation for the in-group, '[SENT]' is tagged as [IN] to denote that the implicit subject of the comment is the in-group team.	1670789067.0	vikings	lions	1333	Giddy Griddy Bang Bang	4.0	0.06802169927035395	0.6400175515577008

Since the commenter is a fan of the Packers and they use 'us' inclusively, this implies that Adam is a player on the in-group team, the Packers. Therefore, 'Adam' should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player from the in-group.	EXPLANATION: The comment sarcastically states that a 4-yard pass to "Adam" will save the team, suggesting that the commenter is talking about the in-group team, the Packers. This interpretation comes not just from the tone of the comment but also from the fairly high win probability, indicating the commenter feels the team still has a chance. "Adam" here most likely refers to Davante Adams, a prominent player on the Packers. The word "us" also indicates that the commenter is including themselves as part of the in-group. Thus, "Adam" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to a player on the in-group team.	1642910005.0	packers	49ers	988		6.0	0.579775333404541	0.9133417061153511

The first 'we' in "If we don't get a pick here" refers to the Packers needing to make an interception (a 'pick') to have a chance to win. The second 'we' in "we lose this game" expresses the consequence of not getting the interception. Fans typically use 'we' to speak about their own team rather than the opposing team, thus both instances of 'we' should be tagged as [IN].	The phrase "we" generally refers to the in-group, which in this case is the Packers, as fans typically use "we" to denote the team they support. Despite the relatively high win probability of 76.3%, the commenter is discussing a crucial moment in the game where they feel the outcome could still be at risk if the in-group does not secure an interception ("pick"). Therefore, both instances of "we" should be tagged with [IN] since they both refer to the in-group team, the Packers.	1673231985.0	packers	lions	1334		-6.0	0.763267785310745	0.43045305931807565
train	yhgf44	iue6wo6	t3_yhgf44	[SENT] NGL [OUT] mechanics are ugly AF . 	["Tua's"]	[(11, 16)]	['[OUT]']	[5]	 The comment describes the mechanics of Tua Tagovailoa, a player for the Dolphins, in a negative manner. Since the commenter supports the Lions and the Dolphins are the opposing team, "Tua's" is tagged as [OUT] to indicate it refers to an out-group entity. There are no in-group or other relevant references in this comment.	EXPLANATION: The comment is criticizing Tua's mechanics, and Tua is a player for the Dolphins, which is the out-group team in this context. Despite the in-group (Lions) having a decent chance of winning the game, the commenter is focusing on a player from the opponent team (Dolphins). As such, the reference to "Tua's" should be tagged as [OUT] since he is a member of the out-group team. The negative comment (calling his mechanics "ugly AF") supports the notion that it is directed towards the out-group.	1667151183.0	lions	dolphins	1335	The Goff Father	3.0	0.601461350917816	0.17934087555336942

[SENT] Literally holding all day 	['McCarthy', 'the refs']	[(7, 15), (27, 35)]	['[IN]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5]	 The comment is likely referring to Mike McCarthy, the head coach of the Cowboys, which makes 'McCarthy' an in-group reference and should be tagged [IN]. The term 'the refs' refers to the referees, who are not affiliated with either the in-group or out-group team and thus should be tagged [OTHER]. In the second sentence, the anger is about holding, which further indicates dissatisfaction with the officiating but does not include any additional specific entities to tag. Therefore, the second sentence remains untagged.	EXPLANATION: McCarthy is the head coach for the Cowboys, the in-group team, so 'McCarthy' should be tagged as [IN]. 'the refs' are an unbiased and neutral third party who officiate the game, and therefore, they should be tagged as [OTHER]. The second sentence lacks an explicit reference to an entity, but it implies frustration with the officiating likely by the in-group team, hence '[SENT]' does not need any specific tagging in this case. The win probability being close to 50% indicates a fairly even game, adding to the context of close officiating decisions being crucial.	1673214580.0	cowboys	commanders	1336		3.0	0.47009986639022805	0.13248058474189128

Thus, properly tagging these entities helps to distinguish the in-group frustrations from the out-group performance causing them. This explains the usage of [IN] and [OUT] appropriately for the tagged entities in the comment.	EXPLANATION: In this comment, the commenter is expressing frustration with how certain positions (TEs and pass-catching RBs) have performed against their own team, the Seahawks.   1. 'TEs' and 'pass catching RBs' are tagged as [OUT] because they are described as having "absolutely destroyed us." The lack of qualification suggests these positions are from the opposing team, the Vikings. 2. 'us' is clearly an in-group reference as it usually refers to the team supported by the commenter, which is the Seahawks. 3. 'this team' refers implicitly to the Seahawks since the commenter is discussing the investments and poor results of their own team.  The second sentence pertains to the same topic but does not introduce new specific entities to tag. Thus 'TEs', 'pass catching RBs' are correctly tagged as [OUT], and 'us' and 'this team' are correctly tagged as [IN].	1632692514.0	seahawks	vikings	1338	​	6.0	0.6139376759529109	0.43171931151881976

Since the game is between the Eagles and Vikings, Wentz is not part of either the in-group (Eagles) or the out-group (Vikings). Therefore, Wentz should be tagged as [OTHER] since he plays for another team in the NFL. The word 'Wentz' is correctly tagged as [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: Carson Wentz is a player for the Washington Commanders, which is neither the in-group (Eagles) nor the out-group (Vikings). The comment mentions Wentz's reputation for throwing interceptions without connecting him to the current game between the Eagles and Vikings. Given this context, 'Wentz' is tagged as [OTHER] because he plays for another team in the NFL, not the Eagles or the Vikings. This makes "[OTHER]" the correct tag for the sentence as the reference to Wentz does not relate to either the in-group or the out-group in this specific game context.	1663643178.0	eagles	vikings	1339		1.0	0.999557554721832	0.9228781554362949

['Brissett']	[(36, 44)]	['[OTHER]']	[5]	 The name "Brissett" refers to Jacoby Brissett, who is a quarterback for the Cleveland Browns. The comment and its parent comment make references to the Browns, which aren't the in-group (Bills) or the out-group (Jets) in this context. Therefore, "Brissett" should be tagged as [OTHER], since it refers to an NFL player from a team that is neither the in-group nor the out-group. The word "They" here most likely refers to the Cleveland Browns as well, implying that the Browns performed better with Brissett, so no entities related to the in-group or out-group teams are mentioned in this sentence.	EXPLANATION: This comment is likely referring to a player that is neither a part of the in-group (Bills) nor the out-group (Jets) since the context provided by the parent comment and the in-group/out-group teams under discussion do not have a direct connection to Brissett. Jacoby Brissett is a quarterback for the Browns, which are not part of the current game between Bills and Jets (thus making it [OTHER]). The high win probability for the in-group suggests they are performing well overall, and the comment appears to be making a broader statement about a different team altogether. Therefore, 'Brissett' should be tagged with [OTHER]. 'They' is not tagged specifically because it is ambiguous and can refer to any team, but in this context, it is interpreted to refer to the Browns, making it implicitly [OTHER] as well.	1670787524.0	bills	jets	1340	:BUF:	6.0	0.875390969216824	0.5174982053122756

['us']	[(73, 75)]	['[IN]']	[5]	 The word 'us' in the third sentence is a clear reference to the in-group team, the Cowboys, since the commenter is talking about their own team being terrible. Fans usually criticize their own team using pronouns like 'us' or 'we,' which indicates that 'us' should be tagged with [IN] as it refers to the in-group. The rest of the sentences do not contain explicit references to the in-group, out-group, or other in this context.	EXPLANATION: The commenter expresses frustration over a missed Defensive Pass Interference (DPI) call, followed by commenting on their team's inevitable poor performance. The third sentence uses “us” to refer to their own team (the Cowboys), acknowledging their terrible performance despite the high win probability. This suggests a pessimistic or self-deprecating view of their team. The high win probability indicates they are likely winning, but the comment clearly focuses on what they see as inevitable issues with their team's performance. Thus, "us" is tagged with [IN] since it refers to the in-group (Cowboys), and the corresponding sentence should be tagged as [IN]. The other sentences do not contain explicit references that need tagging.	1669330459.0	cowboys	giants	1025		8.0	0.712345898151398	0.3988669034331135

This kind of criticism typically comes from a fan of the in-group team, who is expressing frustration with their own team's performance. Therefore, 'ehlinger' should be tagged [IN] because it refers to a member of the in-group team.	EXPLANATION: The commenter is likely referring to Sam Ehlinger, who is a quarterback for the Colts, the in-group team. The play described as "dumb as fuck" is referring to an action by an in-group player, notwithstanding the high win probability, which indicates the team is doing well overall but perhaps made a poor decision in this particular play. Therefore, 'ehlinger' should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group team the commenter supports.	1636075328.0	colts	jets	1342		-8.0	0.964653283118039	0.31204808781252724

['the Steelers', 'They', 'three teams']	[(32, 44), (75, 79), (100, 111)]	['[IN]', '[IN]', '[OTHER]']	[5, 5, 5]	 The comment is about the Steelers' chances of making the playoffs, which indicates a focus on the in-group team. 'the Steelers' explicitly refers to the in-group and should therefore be tagged [IN]. 'They' in the second sentence refers back to the Steelers, maintaining the focus on the in-group, and should also be tagged [IN]. Lastly, 'three teams' refers to other teams in the league that are not directly mentioned but are necessary to lose for the Steelers to make it to the playoffs, and it does not specify the out-group (Browns). Therefore, 'three teams' should be tagged as [OTHER].	EXPLANATION: With a high win probability for the Steelers, the commenter is speculating about playoff scenarios. 'the Steelers' clearly refers to the in-group team. 'They' in the second sentence continues to discuss the Steelers, making it also an in-group reference. The phrase 'three teams' references the need for other teams in the NFL, not specific to the in-group or out-group, to lose for the Steelers to progress, thus it should be tagged as [OTHER].	1641269564.0	steelers	browns	26		3.0	0.959332920610905	0.8801893058784457

In the comment, 'he' likely refers to Ekeler, a player for the in-group (Chargers). Therefore, 'he' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to an in-group player. The rest of the sentence does not mention any specific entities, and there are no implicit references that need tagging.	The parent comment is referring to 'Bro we can’t just run Ekeler every single play.' Ekeler is a player for the Chargers, which is the in-group team. Consequently, the follow-up comment 'It was a new drive, not like he was gassed, or you know, pass the ball?' is logically referring to the same situation, namely the repeated use of the same in-group player, Ekeler, in the game. Despite the high win probability, the commenter is providing constructive criticism on the use of this in-group player, implying 'he' refers to Ekeler. Thus, 'he' should be tagged with [IN] since it refers to a member of the in-group team.	1672615276.0	chargers	rams	1345	Felipe Rios	1.0	0.963028836995363	0.7376736295196692

['online', 'Wilson']	[(11, 17), (86, 92)]	['[IN]', '[IN]']	[5, 5]	 The first sentence criticizes the offensive line, suggesting they should start holding, indicating frustration towards the in-group’s (Seahawks) performance. 'Our online' is a reference to the in-group and should therefore be tagged as [IN]. The second sentence mentions 'Wilson,' who is Russell Wilson, a player for the Seahawks, thus 'Wilson' here should also be tagged as [IN]. This is consistent with fans typically criticizing their own team’s performance or suggesting strategies for them.	The commenter is expressing frustration about their team's offensive line, often abbreviated as "online," and is talking about a quarterback named Wilson. Given that the Seahawks' quarterback is Russell Wilson, the phrases "online" and "Wilson" both refer to entities within the in-group team, the Seahawks. The low win probability suggests that the Seahawks are not performing well, which aligns with the commenter's desire for the offensive line to step up and give Wilson more time to throw. Therefore:  1. "online" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to the in-group's offensive line. 2. "Wilson" should be tagged [IN] as it refers to Russell Wilson, a player for the in-group.  Thus, the correct tags are [IN] for "online" and [IN] for "Wilson".	1637533504.0	seahawks	cardinals	1346	:sea1:​	10.0	0.248755753040314	0.322020165646381
