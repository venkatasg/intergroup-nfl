Provide reasonable explanations for why references to entities are tagged as in-group ([IN]), out-group ([OUT]) or other ([OTHER]) in live, online sports comments during NFL games. The input is the comment, the in-group team the commenter supports, the out-group opponent team, and the target tagged output and the referring expressions from the original comment that were tagged. Using knowledge of American football and contextual language understanding, provide reasonable explanations for why specific words and phrases denoting entities (players, teams, city names, sub-groups within the team) are tagged as referring to the in-group (team the commenter supports), out-group (the opponent) or other (some other team in the NFL that is not the opponent) with respect to the commenter.

Each sentence in a comment is separated by a [SENT] token. Sometimes a sentence in the comment will be about the in/out/other group but not have an explicit word/phrase that refers to the group; In such cases, tag the [SENT] token for that sentence with the corresponding tag label.

Here are 6 examples, with EXPLANATION being a reasonable reason for why TARGET is the correct tagged output for COMMENT with REF_EXPRESSIONS being the words/phrases tagged from COMMENT:

COMMENT: [SENT] Defense getting absolutely bullied by a dude that looks like he sells solar panels
IN-GROUP: Jets
OUT-GROUP: Bears
TARGET: [SENT] [IN] getting absolutely bullied by [OUT] that looks like [OUT] sells solar panels .
REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['Defense', 'a dude', 'he']
EXPLANATION: The commenter is probably talking about the in-group, since 'Defense' is said without qualification, and the description of the offensive player is disparaging ('he sells solar panels'). 'Defense' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to in-group, and 'a dude' and 'he' should be tagged [OUT] since it refers to an out-group offensive player.

COMMENT: [SENT] Hasn’t really been him . [SENT] Receivers have been missing a lot of easy catches.
IN-GROUP: Dolphins
OUT-GROUP: Chargers
TARGET: [SENT] Hasn’t really been [IN] . [SENT] [IN] have been missing a lot of easy catches .
REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['him', 'Receivers']
EXPLANATION: The second sentence is complaining about the receivers missing a lot of catches, thus absolving another player of some blame, which is something fans would only do for the in-group team they support. Thus 'him' in first sentence, and 'Receivers' in second sentence should be tagged with [IN].

COMMENT: [SENT] Cards and rams are gonna be in the post-season regardless, so I don't really care about them losing unless they play us.
IN-GROUP: 49ers
OUT-GROUP: Jaguars
TARGET: [SENT] [OTHER] and [OTHER] are gonna be in the post-season regardless, so I don't really care about [OTHER] losing unless they play [IN].
REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['Cards', 'rams', 'them']
EXPLANATION: The game is between the 49ers and Jaguars, while the words 'Cards' and 'rams' refers to other teams in the NFL. Thus they should be tagged [OTHER] since they are neither in-group nor out-group, as should the word 'them'. 'us' should be tagged [IN] since it refers to the in-group team the player supports.

COMMENT: [SENT] How are we this shit on defense
IN-GROUP: Steelers
OUT-GROUP: Eagles
TARGET: [SENT] How are [IN] this shit on defense
REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['we']
EXPLANATION: 'we' here, and almost always, refers to the in-group since they don't like their team's defense. 'we' should therefore be tagged with [IN] since it refers to in-group.

COMMENT: [SENT] The chiefs got straight fucked with that Herbert INT getting called dead . [SENT] Suck it , KC !	
IN-GROUP: Chargers
OUT-GROUP: Chiefs
TARGET: [SENT] [OUT] got straight fucked with that [IN] INT getting called dead . [SENT] Suck it , [OUT] !
REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['The chiefs', 'Herbert', 'KC']
EXPLANATION: This is a game between the Chiefs and the Chargers, and the commenter is a supporter of the Chiefs, so 'the chiefs' in the first sentence and 'KC' in the second sentence should be tagged [OUT]. Herbert is a player for the Chargers, and should be tagged with [IN] since he is a member of the in-group with respect to the commenter.

COMMENT: [SENT] Need points but 7 would be HUGE momentum
IN-GROUP: Bengals
OUT-GROUP: Chiefs
TARGET: [IN] Need points but 7 would be HUGE momentum
REF_EXPRESSIONS: ['[SENT]']
EXPLANATION: The in-group team probably losing, as the commenter seems to want their team to gain points - something they wouldn't express for the out-group. Thus '[SENT]' should be tagged with '[IN]' since there is no explicit word/phrase that refers to the in-group, but the comment is referring to the in-group implicitly.

Now provide an explanation for why TARGET and REF_EXPRESSIONS are the correct tagged comment and list of referring expressions respectively for the following input. Return only an explanation after 'EXPLANATION: ':
